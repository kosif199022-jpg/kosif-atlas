  Google Search Console reader for a verified site — indexing status
  (is a URL actually indexed, coverage state, last crawl), search
  performance (clicks/impressions/ctr/position by page or query), and

# Google Search Console reader

Read production indexing + performance data for a **verified Search Console
property** and report it — as a real check, not a browser round-trip. This is
read-only by default; the one write command (`submit-sitemap --commit`) is
explicitly gated.

## How it reads (mechanism)

`webmasters`/`webmasters.readonly` are ordinary sensitive (non-restricted)
Google scopes, so `gsc` uses **keyless service-account impersonation** — no
key file, no Python, no node_modules, no env vars:

```
gcloud ADC token (your user creds)
  → IAM generateAccessToken(<reader-SA>, webmasters[.readonly])
  → Search Console API
```

One wrinkle GA4 doesn't have: Search Console's resources split across **two
hostnames** — `searchAnalytics`/`sitemaps`/`sites` live under
`www.googleapis.com/webmasters/v3`, `urlInspection` lives under
`searchconsole.googleapis.com/v1`. The script handles both; you don't need to
think about it.

Every identifier (which site, which SA) is a **required CLI flag**, never an
env var — nothing to export, nothing to leak across terminal sessions or
projects. The script is the reliable **fetch** layer; reading the numbers as
SEO signal is your job.

## First time on a new property — run `setup`, then resolve the site string

```bash
gsc setup --project <gcp-project>              # dry run — prints the gcloud commands
gsc setup --project <gcp-project> --commit      # actually provisions the reader SA
```

This provisions the scriptable half (service account, API enablement, IAM
impersonation grant). It prints the **one step it cannot do** — no API exists
for it: add the SA as a **User** in Search Console → your property →
Settings → Users and permissions → Add user → **Restricted** (enough for
every read command; **Full** only if you'll use `submit-sitemap --commit`).

Once that manual step lands, resolve the exact `--site` string — its format
differs by verification type (URL-prefix: `https://example.com/`, trailing
slash, exact; Domain property: `sc-domain:example.com`, no scheme) — **don't
guess it**:

```bash
gsc sites --sa <the SA email setup printed>
```

## Running it

```bash
gsc <command> --site <siteUrl> --sa <email> [flags]
```

| Command | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `setup --project <id> [--sa-name] [--grant-to] [--commit]` | Provision the reader SA (dry-run by default) |
| `check --site <url> --sa <email>` | Verify the auth chain reaches the account, and whether `--site` is visible to the SA |
| `sites --sa <email>` | Every property the SA can see, with its **exact** `siteUrl` string + `permissionLevel` |
| `performance --site <url> --sa <email> [-d DAYS] [--dimensions page,query] [--page URL] [--query STR] [-n N] [--type web\|image\|video\|news\|discover]` | clicks / impressions / ctr / position, by page and/or query |
| `inspect <url> --site <url> --sa <email>` | Indexing verdict, coverage state, last crawl time, Google's chosen canonical, for one URL |
| `sitemaps --site <url> --sa <email>` | Every submitted sitemap's status: last downloaded, warnings, errors, submitted-vs-indexed counts |
| `submit-sitemap <url> --site <url> --sa <email> [--commit]` | Submit/resubmit a sitemap — **dry-run by default**, needs Full permission to actually commit |
| `report <json \| @file> --site <url> --sa <email>` | Raw `searchAnalytics.query` passthrough for anything the wrapped command doesn't cover |

Output is JSON.

## Reading the numbers

- **Indexing first.** `inspect` on a URL you expect to rank is the ground
  truth — a page can't get impressions if `indexStatusResult.coverageState`
  isn't a healthy indexed state, regardless of how good the content is.
  `Discovered - currently not indexed` (Google knows the URL, hasn't crawled
  it yet) is an earlier, distinct state from "crawled but not indexed" —
  don't conflate them.
- **New / low-authority sites index slowly, and that's not automatically a
  bug.** A page that's been live under two weeks with no crawl yet is often
  just waiting its turn — check `sitemaps` for real errors before assuming
  something is broken.
- **`performance` trends over single-day spikes.** Prefer `-d 28` or wider;
  a few clicks a day is noise at low-authority-site volume. Zero impressions
  for a query you're targeting, sustained over weeks, is the real signal —
  not a one-day dip.
- **`sitemaps`' submitted-vs-indexed gap** is a legitimate site-health metric
  independent of any one page — a growing gap across many URLs points at a
  structural crawl problem (robots.txt, noindex, thin content, crawl budget),
  not "give it more time". This field is also known to lag real-time
  `inspect` status by days — don't treat a stale-looking 0 as contradicting a
  fresher `inspect` result for the same URL.

## What this is not

- **Cannot request indexing or a recrawl of a URL.** Confirmed, not assumed:
  Search Console's own API has no such method anywhere in its resources, and
  Google's separate Indexing API is contractually restricted to `JobPosting`/
  `BroadcastEvent` structured-data pages only — using it for ordinary content
  would violate its terms. This stays a manual click: Search Console UI → URL
  Inspection → **Request Indexing**. Don't re-investigate this later; it was
  checked.
- **Cannot add the reader SA as a Search Console user.** That ACL lives
  inside the product, not GCP IAM, and has no API — `setup` provisions
  everything scriptable and then tells you the one manual step by name.
- Not a keyword-research tool — it reads a property's own historical data,
  it doesn't suggest new keywords or estimate search volume for terms you
  don't already rank for.
- Not Google Analytics — GA4 is a different product with its own sibling
  skill (`ga4`, same plugin, same auth mechanism, different script). Use
  that for users/sessions/engagement; use this for indexing/impressions/
  clicks/rank.

## Troubleshooting

- **`gcloud did not return an ADC token`** → run `gcloud auth
  application-default login` (the plain login; the `webmasters` scope is
  added by the SA via impersonation, not by you).
- **`impersonating … failed`** → your account needs
  `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on the reader SA; run `gsc setup`
  if you haven't, or grant the role directly. A fresh SA can take ~1 min to
  propagate.
- **API call fails with a message about the SA lacking access, or the site
  missing from `sites`** → the SA has not been added as a **User** in
  Search Console → Settings → Users and permissions for that property. This
  is the one step `setup` cannot do — an existing Owner must add the SA's
  email there by hand.
- **API call fails saying the API is disabled** → `gsc setup --commit`
  enables it as part of provisioning; if you set this up by hand instead,
  run `gcloud services enable searchconsole.googleapis.com --project=<project>`.
- **`--site is required` / `--sa is required`** → run `sites` to find the
  exact `--site` string; don't hand-construct it from the domain name.
- **`inspect` returns `verdict: NEUTRAL` / no crawl data** → the URL likely
  hasn't been crawled yet. Not a bug — check `sitemaps` for real errors
  before concluding something is broken.
