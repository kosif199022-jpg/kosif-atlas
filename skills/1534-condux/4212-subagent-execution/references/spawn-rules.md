# Spawn Rules

Reference for deciding when and which agent to spawn. Read this before every spawn decision.

## Agent Cost Tiers

| Tier          | Examples                  | Model                                  | When to Use                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FREE**      | —                         | n/a                                        | Built-in tool calls (bash, grep, file reads) — do these yourself, no agent needed           |
| **CHEAP**     | `explorer`, `researcher`  | haiku (`explorer`), sonnet (`researcher`)  | Read-only, narrow scope, clear output. Good for lookup tasks that would bloat your context  |
| **EXPENSIVE** | `coder`, `planner`        | sonnet (default) — see Model Selection     | Write-capable or high-context output. Justify carefully                                     |

### Model Selection for `coder` Dispatch

`coder`'s baseline model is sonnet. Override per-dispatch based on task
complexity — always pass the model explicitly; an omitted model silently
inherits the session's own model, which is often the most capable and most
expensive tier.

| Task complexity                                                     | Model  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Mechanical, 1-2 files, complete spec/code already in the task brief    | haiku  |
| Multi-file integration, pattern-matching, moderate judgment            | sonnet |
| Architecture-level judgment; the final whole-branch review            | opus   |

Turn count costs more than token price on multi-step work — the cheapest
tier routinely takes more turns to reach the same result, which can cost
more overall. Use sonnet as the floor for reviewers and for implementers
working from prose descriptions; reserve haiku for tasks whose brief
already contains the exact code to write.

## Agent Capability Boundaries

| Agent        | Can Read          | Can Write    | Can Bash   | Use For                                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `explorer`   | ✓ filesystem, git | ✗            | ✗          | Codebase traversal: find patterns, map structure, locate usages |
| `researcher` | ✓ MCP, web, docs  | ✗            | ✗          | External research: library docs, API specs, best practices      |
| `coder`      | ✓                 | ✓ full file  | ✓          | Implementation tasks with isolated scope                        |
| `planner`    | ✓                 | ✓ write only | ✗          | Architecture decisions, task breakdowns, ADRs                   |

**Hard rule:** Specialists receive task context via delegation prompt only. They do not and should not query the plan file directly.

## Spawn Decision Tree

```
Do I have 2+ independent tasks to handle right now (any agent mix)?
│   YES → See subagent-deployment — check its safety checklist,
│         dispatch the cleared ones together in one message.
│   NO  → continue below for the single task in front of you
│
Do I need to do something?
│
├─ Can I do it with a tool call (bash, grep, read)?
│   YES → Do it yourself. No agent needed.
│
├─ Is it a read-only exploration across many files?
│   YES → Is it blocking my current work?
│          YES → Spawn explorer (CHEAP), continue with other work, retrieve later
│          NO  → Do it yourself with grep/read
│
├─ Is it external research (library, API, docs)?
│   YES → Spawn researcher (CHEAP), continue with other work, retrieve later
│
├─ Is it an isolated implementation task?
│   YES → Is it independent of my current work?
│          YES → Can it run in parallel?
│                 YES → Spawn coder (EXPENSIVE), but only if context savings justify it
│                 NO  → Do it yourself
│          NO  → Do it yourself
│
└─ Is it a code review?
    → Use /code-review skill inline — do not spawn a subagent for reviews
```

## Parallel Safety Checklist

See `subagent-deployment/references/safety-checklist.md` — the one
place this logic lives. Do not restate it here.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                     | Why It Wastes Tokens                                                                       | Correct Behavior                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Spawning explorer while coder is running    | Explorer results arrive while coder is mid-task, causing a re-read and integration overhead | Wait for coder to finish, then explore if needed |
| Spawning a subagent for code review         | Review loop compounds with fix loop, multiplying token cost                                | Use /code-review skill inline, once, on request  |
| Spawning coder for a 10-line change         | Delegation overhead costs more than the implementation                                     | Do it yourself                                   |
| Spawning generic agent with injected prompt | Bypasses capability boundaries, unpredictable behavior                                     | Use only named pre-defined agents                |
| Blocking on researcher while work is ready  | Main session idles waiting for non-critical research                                       | Fire research non-blocking, continue other tasks |
