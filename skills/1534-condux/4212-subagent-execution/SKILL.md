description: Execute a plan using named specialist agents. Default is to implement yourself — only spawn when there is a concrete justification.
when_to_use: Trigger when implementing a LARGE plan with tasks that benefit from agent specialization or parallel exploration — including task briefs, review packages, spawn rules, which model a dispatched agent should get, and resuming an interrupted plan from the `.condux/progress/` ledger (not session-handoff). Not for ad-hoc independent tasks outside a plan (that's subagent-deployment).

# /subagent-execution

Execute a plan using specialist agents. Default is to do the work yourself. Spawn only when justified.

## Usage

```
/subagent-execution .condux/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
```

## Core Principle

**Agents must be pre-defined.** Spawn only the named agents that ship with condux
(`explorer`, `researcher`, `planner`, `coder`). Never invent a generic subagent by
injecting a system prompt into a general-purpose one — an agent whose behaviour is
written at call time has no reviewable contract, no consistent tool restrictions,
and no way to improve across sessions.

**You implement by default.** Spawning is an explicit decision with a stated reason — not the default mode of operation.

```
Before spawning any agent, answer:
  1. Why can't I do this task myself?
  2. Which named agent is right for this task?
  3. Is this task independent enough to parallelize?
  4. What exactly will I pass to the agent?
```

If you can't answer all four, don't spawn.

## Progress Ledger

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. Track task completion in a
ledger file, not only in todos.

- At skill start, check for a ledger: `.condux/progress/<feature-slug>.md`
  (slug inferred kebab-case from the plan's feature name — the same
  convention `draft-plan` uses for its own filename). Tasks listed there as
  complete are DONE — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task not
  marked complete.
- If no ledger exists, create it with a header naming the plan file:
  ```
  # Subagent Execution Progress: <feature-slug>

  Plan: .condux/plans/<plan-file>.md

  ```
- When a task's review comes back clean, append one line in the same
  message as other bookkeeping: `- [x] Task N: <name> — commits
  <base7>..<head7>, review clean`.
- The ledger is a recovery aid, not the source of truth — the commits it
  names exist in git even if context no longer remembers creating them.
  After compaction or a new session, trust the ledger and `git log` over
  your own recollection.
- `.condux/` is gitignored working state (see `/workflow` → Artifacts). If
  it's ever deleted, recover progress from `git log` against the plan's task
  list — and note the plan itself lived there too, so re-derive scope from
  the spec in `specs/` if the plan is gone as well.

## How It Works

Before Step 1, check the **Progress Ledger** (above) for already-completed tasks and resume there if any exist.

│  Step 1: READ THE PLAN                                          │

│  Ask: can I implement this myself?                              │
│    YES → implement directly                                     │
│    NO  → consult spawn-rules.md, pick the right agent,         │
│           construct the delegation prompt, spawn                │
│                                                                  │
│  Step 3: GROUP INTO A WAVE                                      │
│  Among this round's unblocked tasks needing an agent, check     │
│  subagent-deployment/references/safety-checklist.md;            │
│  tasks that clear it form one wave.                             │
│                                                                  │
│  Step 4: DISPATCH THE WAVE                                      │
│  Checklist-cleared tasks get dispatched together in one message;│
│  otherwise dispatch one at a time. Either way, don't mix in     │
│  unrelated off-plan work until the current wave finishes.       │
│                                                                  │
│  Step 5: RETRIEVE AND INTEGRATE                                 │
│  Read agent output. Integrate into the codebase.               │
│  You are responsible for coherence — agents don't see each     │
│  other's work.                                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Step 5's "mark task complete" also means appending the ledger line described in **Progress Ledger** — do this in the same message as marking the todo complete.

## Parallel Spawning Rules

For the full safety checklist (which combinations are safe, why, and how
to construct the batch), see
`subagent-deployment/references/safety-checklist.md` — the one place
this logic lives. Do not restate it here.

## Model Selection

Before dispatching any `coder` subagent, choose its model explicitly based
on task complexity — see `references/spawn-rules.md` → Model Selection for
the tiering table. Never omit the model on a dispatch call; an omitted
model inherits the session's own model, which defeats the point of
tiering.

## Delegation Prompt Quality

When spawning, construct the delegation prompt carefully. The agent gets only what you give it.

```
Good delegation prompt includes:
  ✓ The specific task from the plan (full text, not a reference)
  ✓ Relevant file paths and their current state
  ✓ Constraints ("read-only", "no bash", "don't touch auth middleware")
  ✓ Expected output format ("return a summary of findings + file paths")
  ✓ What NOT to do

Bad delegation prompt:
  ✗ "Look into the auth stuff"
  ✗ A file reference without the content
  ✗ No stated output format
  ✗ No constraints
```

## File Handoffs

Pasted plan content and diffs stay resident in context for the rest of the
session and get re-read on every later turn. Hand them over as files
instead:

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run
  `references/task-brief.sh <plan-file> <task-number>` — it extracts the
  task's full text to a scratch file and prints the path. Reference that
  path in the dispatch prompt ("read this first — it is your
  requirements"), plus any interfaces/decisions from earlier tasks the
  brief can't know.
- **Review package:** record the commit SHA before dispatching the
  implementer (this is BASE — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all
  but the last commit of a multi-commit task). After the implementer
  reports DONE, run `references/review-package.sh <BASE> <HEAD>` and pass
  the printed path to the task reviewer instead of pasting the diff.
- For the final whole-branch review, BASE is the branch's merge-base with
  its parent (e.g. `git merge-base main HEAD`), not the per-task BASE.

## Non-Blocking Research Pattern

For research/exploration tasks, prefer non-blocking delegation:

1. Spawn the `researcher` or `explorer` agent with a clear question
2. Continue implementing other tasks while it runs
3. Retrieve the result when you need it

Don't block the main session waiting for research that isn't on the critical path.

## Codex: Installing the Named Agents

Codex plugins cannot bundle agents (the Codex plugin format has no `agents/`
component) — custom agents live as standalone TOML files under
`$CODEX_HOME/agents/` (personal) or `<repo>/.codex/agents/` (project).
Generate or refresh them from the canonical definitions here:

```bash
node "$(find ~/.claude ~/.codex ~/.agents -name install-codex-agents.mjs -path '*subagent-execution*' 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
```

Re-run after any agent-definition change (agents ship inside the condux
plugin, but Codex won't load them from there). Existing TOMLs are backed up
to `*.bak`; your `model` / `model_reasoning_effort` / `sandbox_mode` /
`nickname_candidates` tuning is preserved. A custom agent named `explorer`
takes precedence over Codex's built-in `explorer` (documented behavior).
