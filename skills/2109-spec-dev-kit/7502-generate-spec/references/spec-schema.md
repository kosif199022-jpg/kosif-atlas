# Spec Schema — YAML Front Matter

**Version**: 2.0
**Written by**: `spec-synthesizer` (Station 6), `merge-spec.mjs` (continue runs)
**Validated by**: `scripts/validate-spec.mjs` (Station 7 and publish)
**Read by**: every downstream kit — see `consumer-contract.md` for who reads which section and in what order

---

## Design rules

1. **The YAML is the contract.** Everything a build kit needs is in the front matter. The Markdown
   body holds only narrative that cannot live in YAML (problem, solution overview, flows, rationale).
2. **One home per fact.** Each requirement, rule, decision, assumption, and question is written
   once, in its own section, and referenced by id everywhere else. Never restate an item in a second
   section. A risk that depends on an open question says `Q-001`; it does not repeat the question.
3. **Stated is not assumed.** A rule that appears in `.spec/context/` is a `requirements[]` entry
   with `source: stated`. `assumptions[]` holds only what the pipeline inferred.
4. **Everything is addressable.** Every list item has an id (or, for entities, a unique `name`).
   Downstream kits pass ids, not prose.
5. **Human views are generated, not written.** Tables (coverage, permissions, API list, screen
   inventory, delivery checklist) come from `scripts/render-spec-views.mjs` into `spec.views.md`.
   The synthesizer never hand-writes them.

## Id kinds

| Prefix | Section | Prefix | Section |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| `REQ-` | `requirements[]` | `SCR-` | `ui-surface.screens[]` |
| `KPI-` | `context.success-metrics[]` | `INT-` | `ui-surface.interactions[]` |
| `PERM-` | `permissions[]` | `API-` | `api-surface.endpoints[]` |
| `BR-` | `business-rules[]` | `AGT-` / `TOOL-` / `KB-` | `agent-surface.*` |
| `SM-` | `state-machines[]` | `NTF-` | `notifications[]` |
| `US-` | `user-stories[]` | `RISK-` | `risks[]` |
| `AC-` | `acceptance-criteria[]` | `ASSM-` | `assumptions[]` |
| `SL-` | `delivery-plan.slices[]` | `Q-` / `DEC-` | `open-questions[]` / `traceability.decisions[]` |

Ids are 3-digit zero-padded, sequential, never reused. Continue runs take the next free number from
`artifacts/prior-index.json` (`next`). Entities and roles are referenced by `name`.

Optional sections may be omitted when empty: `glossary`, `context.success-metrics`,
`agent-surface`, `notifications`, `state-machines` (only when no entity has a lifecycle field),
`api-surface` (UI-only / local-only products — say so in `context.constraints`).

## Status Lifecycle

```
draft → (awaiting-clarification ⇄ analyzing) → enriching → reviewing → approved → building → done
                                                            └── changes-requested ──┘
```

The synthesizer emits `reviewing`. Only `publish-spec.mjs` (after explicit human approval) sets
`approved`. Downstream kits may set `building` / `done`.

---

## Validation Rules (enforced by `validate-spec.mjs`)

Errors block Station 7 and publish. Warnings are surfaced in the Station 9 review packet.

### Structure (all versions)

| Rule | Code |
|------|------|
| `spec-version` ∈ `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.0` | `SCHEMA_VERSION_INVALID` |
| `timecode` matches `\d{8}-\d{6}` | `TIMECODE_FORMAT_INVALID` |
| `type`, `status` valid | `TYPE_INVALID`, `STATUS_INVALID` |
| `metadata.slug` kebab-case | `SLUG_FORMAT_INVALID` |
| Every id matches its prefix and is unique across the spec | `ID_FORMAT_INVALID`, `DUPLICATE_ID` |
| `acceptance-criteria[].story-ref` resolves | `BROKEN_STORY_REF` |
| `testable` is boolean | `TESTABLE_FLAG_MISSING` |
| HTTP method valid | `HTTP_METHOD_INVALID` |
| `non-functional.performance` and `.accessibility` non-empty | `NFR_INCOMPLETE` |
| Agent / tool / KB refs resolve | `BROKEN_TOOL_REF`, `BROKEN_KB_REF`, `BROKEN_API_REF` |

### Contract quality (`2.0`)

| Rule | Code | Level |
|------|------|-------|
| `api-surface.mutations` is absent — one `endpoints` list | `MUTATIONS_DEPRECATED` | error |
| No two endpoints share `method + path`; no singular/plural spelling of the same path | `DUPLICATE_ENDPOINT` | error |
| Every id referenced anywhere (`covered-by`, `*-refs`, `refs`, `affects`, `guard`, `effects`, `done-when`) resolves | `BROKEN_REF` | error |
| Every role name used (`as`, `allow`, `conditional`, `roles`, `actor`, `target-users`) exists in `roles[]` | `UNKNOWN_ROLE` | error |
| Relationship `type` is one of the four values; `entity` exists | `RELATIONSHIP_INVALID` | error |
| Field descriptions are not placeholders (`Field x.`, empty, or equal to the field name) | `PLACEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION` | error |
| Enum-typed fields (`…Status`, or any field with `values`) list `values` | `ENUM_VALUES_MISSING` | error |
| A lifecycle field with 2+ values has a state machine; its `states` equal the field `values`; transitions use known states | `STATE_MACHINE_MISSING`, `STATE_MACHINE_INVALID` | error |
| Every `must` + `scope: in` requirement has non-empty `covered-by` (`metric` → a `KPI-*`) | `REQUIREMENT_UNCOVERED` | error |
| `requirements[].source` is `stated` or `answered` (an inference is an assumption, never a requirement) | `REQUIREMENT_INVALID` | error |
| Every `must` story has ≥1 `happy` AC and ≥1 non-happy AC | `STORY_UNHAPPY_PATH_MISSING` | error |
| Every business rule has ≥1 `ac-refs` | `RULE_UNTESTED` | error |
| Every `must` story is in exactly one slice; `depends-on` points to earlier slices only | `SLICE_STORY_UNASSIGNED`, `SLICE_STORY_DUPLICATED`, `SLICE_ORDER_INVALID` | error |
| Every screen and endpoint belongs to some slice | `SLICE_COVERAGE_GAP` | warning |
| Slice `tracks` match its refs (API → backend, SCR → frontend, AGT → agent) | `SLICE_TRACK_MISMATCH` | warning |
| An assumption restates a requirement, an open question restates an assumption, or two business rules say the same thing | `DUPLICATE_STATEMENT` | warning |
| A human-triggered transition names no `api-ref` | `TRANSITION_NO_ENDPOINT` | warning |
| A permission has no `ac-refs` | `PERMISSION_UNTESTED` | warning |
| An assumption has empty `affects` | `ASSUMPTION_UNLINKED` | warning |
| A slice lists a permission whose endpoints another slice builds | `SLICE_PERMISSION_MISPLACED` | warning |

| Screen lacks `page-type` / `primary-entity` | `SCREEN_UNTYPED` | warning |

`1.x` specs get the structure checks plus warnings for the 2.0 rules, so old specs still validate and
downstream kits still read them (see `consumer-contract.md` § Legacy specs).

## Minimum Viable Spec (required for `status: approved`)

- `metadata.title`, `context.problem`, `context.goal` non-empty
- `context.target-users` ≥ 1 and `roles` ≥ 1 (`2.0`)
- `user-stories` ≥ 1, each with ≥ 1 acceptance criterion
- `non-functional.accessibility` and `non-functional.security` ≥ 1
- `requirements` ≥ 1 (`2.0`) — `1.x`: `traceability.source-requirements` ≥ 1
- `delivery-plan.slices` ≥ 1 (`2.0`)

## Prototype / HTML consumability

`html-generator-kit` renders one page per screen and one table column / form field per entity field.

- Every entity on a screen has a complete field list with real TypeScript types — never just
  `id` + `name`.
- Enum fields list `values`. For `1.x` readers, also end the description with
  `One of: A, B, C` (the synthesizer writes both).
- Every screen sets `page-type` and `primary-entity` explicitly. `notes` still starts with a
  page-type word (list / view / create / dashboard / settings) for older readers.
- `components[]` are specific named components (`ProfilesTable`, `CreateProfileModal`), never
  `Table` or `Button`.
- `derived: true` fields are shown, never rendered as form inputs.

## Schema Evolution

1. Bump `spec-version`: minor for additive optional fields, major for removed or renamed fields.
2. Update this file, `templates/spec-frontmatter.yaml`, `scripts/validate-spec.mjs`
   (`SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSIONS`), `scripts/merge-spec.mjs`, and `consumer-contract.md`.
3. Keep readers tolerant of the previous major version.

| Version | Change |
|---------|--------|
| 1.0 | Initial hybrid spec |
| 1.1 | `context.non-goals[]` |
| 1.2 | optional `agent-surface` |
| 2.0 | `requirements`, `roles`, `permissions`, `business-rules`, `state-machines`, `notifications`, `glossary`, `context.success-metrics`, `boundaries`, `delivery-plan`; `many-to-one`; enum `values`; screen `page-type` / `primary-entity`; AC `kind`; `api-surface.mutations` removed (merged into `endpoints`); `traceability.source-requirements` replaced by `requirements[].source-ref`; generated views moved out of the body |
