description: Transforms raw user requirements in .spec/context/ into a validated, approved hybrid YAML+Markdown spec in .spec/spec/ — a requirements register with coverage, roles and permissions, business rules, state machines, notifications, and a step-by-step delivery plan with per-slice build briefs for downstream kits. Runs the full spec-dev-kit pipeline — intake, gap analysis, clarification, enrichment, completeness gating, synthesis, deterministic validation, diagram generation, and human review — then publishes the result. Use when starting any new feature, domain, or app where no spec exists yet, or when the next feature's context files should continue the last app spec's story and screen ids.

# SKILL: generate-spec

**Command**: `/generate-spec [feature-name]`
**Entry point for**: the spec-dev-kit pipeline
**Pipeline driver**: `spec-orchestrator` agent (see `../../agents/spec-orchestrator.md`)

This skill runs in the **main conversation**. It owns every `AskUserQuestion` call. The
orchestrator is a subagent and must never ask the user — it returns a packet and stops.

---

## Purpose

Transforms raw user requirements in `.spec/context/` into a structured, validated, approved
hybrid YAML+Markdown spec under `.spec/spec/` (schema 2.0). The spec is a **build guide**: every
stated requirement is registered and covered, and `delivery-plan.slices` says what to build in
which order, with steps per track and `done-when` ACs. At publish, one build brief per slice is
written to `{RUN_DIR}/slices/SL-NNN.yaml`.

Downstream kits read `.spec/app/current.json` for the path — never the spec body in chat. Pass
`{RUN_DIR}/spec.md` and `{RUN_DIR}/kit-result.json`. How each kit reads the spec:
`references/consumer-contract.md`.

---

## Resolve KIT_DIR (do this first)

`KIT_DIR` is the **plugin root** (the directory that contains `agents/` and `skills/`). Resolve in
this order; use the first that exists:

1. Parent of this skill folder — `{this SKILL.md directory}/../..` (Claude: if
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is set, `KIT_DIR` is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`).
2. `app-dev-kit/spec-dev-kit` relative to the workspace root (this marketplace repo).
3. `.spec/spec-dev-kit` (legacy consumer copy).

All script and reference paths are `{KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/…`. Never hardcode
`.spec/spec-dev-kit/skills/…`.

## Prerequisites

The user MUST have at least one `.md` file in `.spec/context/` containing requirements, notes, or
feature descriptions. If `.spec/context/` is empty, report and stop:

```
No requirement files found in .spec/context/.
Drop your requirements as .md files there, then run /generate-spec again.
```

Accepted content: feature requests, user notes, meeting summaries, partial specs,
screenshot-to-text transcriptions, email/Slack transcripts.

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `[feature-name]` | Optional | Hint for the spec slug. If omitted, slug is derived from context files per `references/artifact-naming.md`. |

```
/generate-spec
/generate-spec profile-management
/generate-spec "Invoice Approval Workflow"
```

---

## Steps

Read `{KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/references/pipeline-flow.md` before Station 0.

### Step 1 — Context Check

1. `Glob(".spec/context/*.md")`.
2. If none found → report to user and STOP (do not write a kit-result — there is no `RUN_DIR` yet).
3. List found files: `"Found {N} requirement file(s): {filenames}. Proceeding."`

### Step 2 — Scaffold Run (Station 0)

1. Read `references/artifact-naming.md`.
2. Derive `slug` from `[feature-name]` (normalized) or from context file signals.
3. Scaffold from the shared pointer (`.spec/app/current.json`), not from older context files.
   `.spec/processed/` is archive, not input. See `references/app-state.md`.

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/continue-spec.mjs --slug {slug}
```

Capture `MODE`, `SPEC_ID`, `RUN_DIR`, `PRIOR_INDEX`, `APP_SLUG`, and `TIMECODE` from stdout.
Use `APP_SLUG` as the app slug from here on (`MODE=continue` keeps the existing app slug).
4. Log: `"[generate-spec] Timecode: {TIMECODE} | Slug: {APP_SLUG} | Run dir: {RUN_DIR} | MODE: {MODE} | KIT_DIR: {KIT_DIR}"`

### Step 3 — Intake (Station 1)

Read and normalize context files per `references/context-protocol.md`:
- Glob `.spec/context/*.md`, sort by modification time descending.
- For each file: extract **atomic** `raw_requirements` (one testable statement each, with
  `source_line`; every row of a roles / notifications / edge-case table is its own entry; every
  number — limit, timer, retention — is kept verbatim; each entry gets a stable `R-NNN` id), the source's glossary,
  decisions it says are already made, slug/type hints, and surface conflicts.
- A long, structured PRD yields hundreds of entries — that is expected. Do not summarise.
- Write `intake_report` to `{RUN_DIR}/artifacts/intake.json`.
- Ensure `{RUN_DIR}/artifacts/qa-log.md` exists (empty file is fine).

### Step 4 — Drive the orchestrator until publish

Spawn `spec-orchestrator`. It **never** asks the user. Loop on packets:

```
MODE:      build          # then resume | revise
TIMECODE / SLUG / RUN_DIR / KIT_DIR
APP_SLUG:  {APP_SLUG}
CONTINUE:  {MODE}         # first | continue
PRIOR_INDEX: {PRIOR_INDEX}
INTAKE_REPORT_PATH: {RUN_DIR}/artifacts/intake.json

Read {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/references/pipeline-flow.md before any station.
Do NOT call AskUserQuestion. Do NOT inline base.spec.md or prior context files.
Return one packet and STOP.
PULSE:        {RUN_DIR}/watch/spec-orchestrator.json
PULSE_SCRIPT: {PULSE_SCRIPT argument, or the resolved check-pulse.mjs}
WATCH:        .spec/app/watch/current.json
```

Spawn that orchestrator with `run_in_background: true`, then run the parent loop. Do not block on the Agent call.

### Liveness — poll the orchestrator

Canonical procedure: `{PULSE_SCRIPT directory}/../references/agent-liveness.md` when that file exists. It wins if this section disagrees. Resolve `PULSE_SCRIPT` in order: the argument, `app-dev-kit/frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs` from the workspace root, then `{KIT_DIR}/../frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs`.

`PULSE` is `{RUN_DIR}/watch/spec-orchestrator.json`. Write the pointer before the spawn (this is Station 1's watch file — `RUN_DIR` did not exist when `/orchestrate-frontend` started):

```bash
node {PULSE_SCRIPT} --watch .spec/app/watch/current.json --station 1 --pulse {PULSE}
```

1. Record `agent_id`. Touch `--role spec-orchestrator --status working --station start`.
2. Every 60 seconds, `sleep 60` once, then `node {PULSE_SCRIPT} --check --pulse {PULSE}`. Do not end the turn while `status` is `working`.
3. Exit 0: keep waiting. Exit 2: Read `{dirname(PULSE)}/packet.json` and handle it in the packet table below. Exit 3, 4, or 5: `resume` the same id once ("Update the pulse and continue from the checkpoint"). If that does not move `updated_at` within 60 seconds, abandon it (`interrupt: true` only when it is still running) and fresh-spawn from the checkpoint path. At most two fresh spawns. Then write `{RUN_DIR}/kit-result.json` with `--outcome error --reason stale-agent` and stop.
4. `awaiting-human` is healthy. Never resume or rebuild across it.

If the script is missing, Read the pulse JSON and apply the same rules: `working` and `updated_at` older than 3 minutes → not responding; `station` and `artifact` unchanged for 15 minutes → stalled; `awaiting-human` → healthy; no file → missing.

Re-spawns (`MODE: resume` or `revise`) use this same loop.

| Packet `type` | This skill |
|---------------|------------|
| `CLARIFY_PACKET` | `AskUserQuestion(questions[])` (one batched call). Append `## Round {n}` (or `## Completeness Round {n}`) plus verbatim Q&A to `{RUN_DIR}/artifacts/qa-log.md`, each question headed with its `gap_refs`. Re-spawn `MODE: resume` with `RESUME_AT`, `NEW_ANSWERS`, and the packet's round counters. |
| `REVIEW_PACKET` | `AskUserQuestion(review_packet)`. On **explicit** approval → Step 5. On changes → re-spawn `MODE: revise` with `CHANGE_REQUEST` and `REVIEW_CYCLES`. Ambiguous "sounds good" is not approval — re-ask (see clarification-protocol § Restate & Confirm). |
| `ESCALATION_PACKET` | `AskUserQuestion` with the packet errors/options. Apply the user's choice (`resume` with answers, approve-as-is → Step 5, or STOP after writing an aborted `kit-result.json`). |
| `READY_TO_PUBLISH` | Step 5. |

Max rounds are enforced by the orchestrator; this skill still stops if a loop exceeds the table in
`pipeline-flow.md`.

### Step 5 — Publish (Station 10)

Only after explicit approval (or approve-as-is escalation):

1. Approve the spec only when it still passes validation. This sets `status: approved`,
   re-runs the validator with `--require-approved`, renders `spec.views.md`, and writes one
   build brief per slice to `{RUN_DIR}/slices/`; on failure it puts `status` back to `reviewing`:

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/publish-spec.mjs {RUN_DIR}/spec.md
```

Exit 0: `status` is `approved`. Continue. Exit 1: `status` is `reviewing` again. Show the
validator errors to the human. Do not archive. Do not write an approved envelope. Stop.

2. Archive the inbox and move the shared pointer. Do this only after exit 0. An abort leaves
   `.spec/context/` in place and does not change `current.json`.

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/archive-context.mjs --run {RUN_DIR}
```

3. Write the path-only envelope (parent orchestrators read this file, not this report):

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/write-kit-result.mjs \
  --out {RUN_DIR}/kit-result.json \
  --kit generate-spec \
  --outcome approved \
  --spec-path {RUN_DIR}/spec.md \
  --slug {slug} \
  --run-dir {RUN_DIR}
```

If the caller passed `RESULT_OUT`, add `--also {RESULT_OUT}`.

4. Report **paths only** (do not paste spec YAML):

```
Spec published: {RUN_DIR}/spec.md
Views:  {RUN_DIR}/spec.views.md
Slices: {RUN_DIR}/slices/ ({N} build briefs, in build order)
Pointer: .spec/app/current.json
Context archived: .spec/processed/{SPEC_ID}/
Result: {RUN_DIR}/kit-result.json

Next steps:
  /generate-html         → prototype the screens (reads current.json)
  /orchestrate-app       → build every slice in order: backend, agent, frontend (reads current.json)
  /orchestrate-frontend  → build the frontend slices only
```

On any STOP after Step 2 created `RUN_DIR` (human abort, drop, unrecoverable escalation):

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/write-kit-result.mjs \
  --out {RUN_DIR}/kit-result.json \
  --kit generate-spec \
  --outcome aborted \
  --spec-path {RUN_DIR}/spec.md \
  --slug {slug} \
  --run-dir {RUN_DIR} \
  --reason "{short reason}"
```

## Validation

The orchestrator runs Station 7:

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/generate-spec/scripts/validate-spec.mjs {RUN_DIR}/spec.md
```

Exit 0 = valid; exit 1 = `ERROR [CODE] …` (codes in `references/spec-schema.md` § Validation
Rules — e.g. `REQUIREMENT_UNCOVERED`, `STORY_UNHAPPY_PATH_MISSING`, `STATE_MACHINE_MISSING`,
`SLICE_STORY_UNASSIGNED`, `BODY_DUPLICATES_YAML`). After two failed correction passes the
orchestrator returns `ESCALATION_PACKET`. `WARN` lines surface in the Station 9 review packet.

---

## Expected Duration

| Phase | Typical Duration |
|-------|-----------------|
| Intake + Analysis | ~30 s |
| Per clarification round | ~2 min (user response time varies) |
| Enrichment + Completeness | ~45 s |
| Synthesis | ~60 s |
| Validation + Diagrams | ~30 s |
| Review | ~1–3 min (user response time varies) |
| **Total (0 clarification rounds)** | ~3 min |
| **Total (2 clarification rounds)** | ~7–10 min |

---

## Re-Running

A later `/generate-spec` reads `.spec/app/current.json`, copies that spec to `base.spec.md`, and
assigns the next free id of every kind (`US`, `AC`, `SCR`, `API`, `REQ`, `BR`, `SM`, `SL`, …). The
new feature arrives as new requirements, stories, and **new delivery slices** appended to the plan. The model sees `artifacts/prior-index.json` (id, title,
route, entity name) plus the new inbox files — not the old notes and not the full previous spec.
Publish writes a new `.spec/spec/{spec-id}/` folder, moves the inbox to `.spec/processed/{spec-id}/`,
and leaves the previous spec on disk.

`revert-increment.mjs` points `current.json` at the parent spec and prototype. It does not delete
the newer folders.

Station 9 still applies targeted edits inside the current run before publish.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| "No files found in .spec/context/" | Drop `.md` files with your requirements there |
| Pipeline seems stuck | Check for a pending `AskUserQuestion` from **this** skill — answer it |
| Spec generated but incorrect | Add notes to `.spec/context/` and re-run |
| Validation errors repeat | Check `references/spec-schema.md` for the failing rule code |
| `REQUIREMENT_UNCOVERED` | A stated must-rule has no AC / rule / state machine implementing it — add one, never delete the requirement |
| `SLICE_STORY_UNASSIGNED` | Put the story in a delivery slice (review can move stories between slices) |
| Slug is wrong | Run `/generate-spec [correct-slug]` |
| `validate-spec.mjs` exits with FATAL | Run from repo root so `node_modules/yaml` is resolvable |
| Scripts not found | Re-resolve `KIT_DIR` (plugin root, not `.spec/spec-dev-kit/` unless that copy exists) |
