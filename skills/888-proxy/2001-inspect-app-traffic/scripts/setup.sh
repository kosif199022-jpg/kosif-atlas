# ABOUTME: Detects whether this Mac is ready to capture traffic with mitmproxy, and
# ABOUTME: prints the exact remaining steps (install, CA generate, CA trust) if not.
#
# Idempotent state check. Reports JSON on stdout: whether mitmdump is installed, whether the
# mitmproxy CA exists, and whether that CA is trusted in the System keychain. Exit 0 means
# fully ready and setup can be skipped; exit 1 means one or more steps remain, each printed
# as a ready-to-run command. The one step that needs a real TTY (the sudo trust of the CA)
# is never run here — it is printed for the user to run, because sudo cannot read a password
# through this harness.
