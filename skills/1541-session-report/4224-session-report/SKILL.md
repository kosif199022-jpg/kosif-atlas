name: session-report
description: Generates a self-contained HTML report of session usage — tokens, cache efficiency, subagent costs, and slash command frequency — from local transcripts.
when_to_use: Run when the user asks what a session or period cost — "token usage", "how much did I spend", "cache hit rate", "session report". Works for Claude Code (~/.claude) and Codex (~/.codex). Pass a time range as argument (24h, 7d, 30d, all) — defaults to 7d. Not for saving state to continue work later — that's session-handoff.

# Session Report

Produce a self-contained HTML report of session usage and save it to
`<git-root>/.session-report/`.

## Steps

1. **Detect tool and pick analyzer.** Run:
   ```sh
   if [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ] || [ -n "$CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED" ]; then
     TOOL=codex; ANALYZER=analyze-codex.mjs
   elif [ -d "$HOME/.codex/sessions" ] && [ ! -d "$HOME/.claude/projects" ]; then
     TOOL=codex; ANALYZER=analyze-codex.mjs
   elif [ -d "$HOME/.claude/projects" ]; then
     TOOL=claude; ANALYZER=analyze-claude.mjs
   else
     TOOL=codex; ANALYZER=analyze-codex.mjs
   fi
   ```
   **Ambiguous case** — if both `~/.codex/sessions` and `~/.claude/projects` exist and no env var matched, the shell above falls through to `TOOL=claude`. Honor that result exactly:
   - **If you are Codex**: override to `TOOL=codex; ANALYZER=analyze-codex.mjs`
   - **If you are Claude Code**: the shell result is correct — keep `TOOL=claude; ANALYZER=analyze-claude.mjs`. Do **not** change it.

   The user can also force the tool with `--tool codex` or `--tool claude`.

2. **Parse time range** from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `7d`, `30d`, `24h`). Default: `7d`. If `all` — omit `--since`.

3. **Run the analyzer.** Both scripts live alongside this SKILL.md — use the absolute path. Resolve the report directory first and write the JSON there too (it is this skill's working-state home, already gitignored — `/tmp` would strand the intermediate outside the artifact contract). The `${TOOL}` suffix keeps concurrent runs from different tools from colliding:
   ```sh
   OUT_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)/.session-report"
   mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR"
   # With --since:
   node <skill-dir>/$ANALYZER --json --since 7d > "$OUT_DIR/session-report-${TOOL}.json"

   # All-time:
   node <skill-dir>/$ANALYZER --json > "$OUT_DIR/session-report-${TOOL}.json"
   ```

4. **Read** `$OUT_DIR/session-report-${TOOL}.json`. Skim `overall`, `by_project`, `by_subagent_type`, `by_skill`, `cache_breaks`, `top_prompts`.

5. **Copy the template** into the report directory:
   ```sh
   # $OUT_DIR was resolved in step 3
   cp <skill-dir>/template.html "$OUT_DIR/session-report-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).html"
   ```
   Reports are gitignored working state, not project docs. Before the first
   write in a repo, run the bootstrap once: `git check-ignore -q
   .session-report/` — if it isn't ignored, ask once ("Reports are scratch —
   add `.session-report/` to `.gitignore`?") and append on yes, or write to
   `.git/info/exclude` if the user would rather not touch a tracked file.
   Never edit either file without asking. Outside a git repo the path falls
   back to `./.session-report/` — say so once. An `AGENTS.md` override wins.

6. **Edit the output file** (use Edit, not Write — preserve the template's JS/CSS):
   - Replace the contents of `<script id="report-data" type="application/json">` with the full JSON from step 3. The analyzers serialize `<` as `\u003c`, so transcript text cannot close the script element; preserve those escapes exactly. The page's JS renders everything automatically from this blob. **IMPORTANT: the script tag must contain only valid JSON — no comments, no debug lines, no analysis notes. Any non-JSON text before or after the `{...}` will break `JSON.parse()` and leave all sections blank.**
   - Fill the `<!-- AGENT: anomalies -->` block with **3–5 one-line findings**. Express figures as **% of total tokens** (total = `overall.input_tokens.total + overall.output_tokens`):
     ```html
     <div class="take bad"><div class="fig">41.2%</div><div class="txt"><b>project-x</b> consumed 41% of the week across 3 sessions</div></div>
     ```
     Classes: `.take bad` (red) for waste/anomalies, `.take good` (green) for healthy signals, `.take info` (blue) for neutral. Look for: project eating disproportionate share, cache-hit <85%, single prompt >2% of total, subagents averaging >1M tokens/call, clustering cache breaks.

     **Codex note:** `pct_cached` will be 0 for most OpenAI models — only flag this if the model supports prompt caching.

   - Fill the `<!-- AGENT: optimizations -->` block with `<div class="callout">` suggestions. Work the checklist below and write one callout per signal that actually fires — typically 3–6. Each callout must name the row it came from and the change it implies; a suggestion with no number attached to it is noise.

     | Check | Data path | Fires when | Say |
     |---|---|---|---|
     | Cache breaks | `overall.cache_breaks_over_100k`, `cache_breaks[]` | > 0, especially clustered in one project or one day | Which project and when, and that a `/compact` before the repeated resume is the cheaper path |
     | Subagent cost | `overall.subagent.avg_tokens_per_call` | > 500k per call | Which subagent type from `by_subagent_type` dominates, and that its brief is carrying the context rather than the work |
     | Cache hit rate | `overall.input_tokens.pct_cached` | < 85% (Claude only — see the Codex note) | The rate, and which project in `by_project` drags it down |
     | Project concentration | `by_project[].input_tokens.total` | one project > 50% of the total | Name it with its share and its `cost_usd.total` |
     | Model mix | `by_project[].by_model`, the `top model` column | an expensive model dominates a low-`efficiency_score` project | The project, its dominant model, and its cost |
     | Per-project efficiency | `by_project[].efficiency_score` | any project scores below the overall score | Which one, and which of cache / msgs / subagents its score is losing on |
     | Single-prompt cost | `top_prompts[0]` | > 2% of total tokens | The prompt, truncated, with its share and session id |
     | Session hygiene | `overall.hours.active` vs `.wall_clock` | active < 50% of wall clock | That sessions are being left open, and that every per-hour figure below is diluted by it |

     Skip a row rather than inventing one: an empty checklist entry is a healthy report, not a gap to fill. If nothing fires, say so in a single callout.
   - HTML-escape every transcript-derived project, prompt, model, skill, and tool label inserted into either agent-authored block.
   - Do not restructure existing sections. Each section's body now sits inside a `<details class="fold" open>` with its `<h2>` in the `<summary>` — the two `<!-- AGENT: … -->` markers moved with it, so edit **by marker**, never by line number. Do not add, remove or reorder sections, and do not delete the hidden `#prompt-histogram` container: the render writes to it without a null guard, and removing it kills every render step that follows, including the section nav.

7. **Report** the saved file path. Do not open it or render it.

## Notes

- The template auto-adjusts titlebar and command text from `DATA.tool` in the JSON.
- For Codex: slash commands are extracted from message text (best-effort, not precise attribution). The `by_skill` table shows commands that appeared as `/foo` in user messages.
- For Codex: the subagent replay overcounting problem is handled by the analyzer — events timestamped before the session's own start are discarded.
- If JSON is >2MB, trim `top_prompts` and `cache_breaks` to 100 entries each before embedding.
