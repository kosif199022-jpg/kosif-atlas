# session-chat: peer-pane messaging

This plugin lets Claude/Codex sessions running in different tmux panes message each other. Two operations:

- `/send <name> <text>` — short, single-line message (status pings, acks, replies, "done", "ready").
- `/dispatch <name> <prompt>` — task hand-off; full prompt is written to a file and the recipient reads it.

## When to use which

| Use `/send` when… | Use `/dispatch` when… |
|---|---|
| Payload is one line | Payload is multi-line |
| Payload ≤ 1024 chars | Payload contains code, lists, structure |
| You want a quick reply / status | You want the peer to do work |
| No file content needs to round-trip | The task references files, plans, or instructions |

`/send` enforces the contract: it **refuses** to send when payload contains newlines or exceeds 1024 chars (configurable via `SESSION_CHAT_SEND_MAX_LEN`). If you hit that error, switch to `/dispatch`.

## Recipient prerequisites (read before dispatching)

A recipient pane will only receive messages if **both** are true:

1. The recipient has a registered pane name (via `/whoami <name>`, or auto-named at SessionStart from the session's custom title).
2. The recipient's `SESSION_CHAT_INCOMING_MODE` is set to one of:
   - `auto` — recipient may read the dispatch file and act without confirming.
   - `assist` — recipient summarizes the incoming message and asks the local user before acting.
   - `notify` (default) — recipient is told a message arrived but is **forbidden** from reading the dispatch file. Orchestration silently no-ops in this mode.
   - `off` — hook does nothing.

If you are orchestrating peer agents, set `SESSION_CHAT_INCOMING_MODE=auto` in the recipient's environment **before** they start their session, or your dispatches will land but never be acted on.

## Message format the recipient sees

Both operations produce a single line in the recipient's prompt buffer:

- `/send` →  `[from:NAME pane:%N id:HEX8] <message text> [id:HEX8]`
- `/dispatch` → `[from:NAME pane:%N msg:/path/to/file.md id:HEX8] dispatch (N lines) — read msg file for full task id:HEX8`

The `id:` field is a unique verification marker and is repeated at the tail so it remains visible in TUIs that show the end of long input lines. The dispatch line **does not include a preview** of the message body — the recipient must read `$msg_file`.

## Reliability contract

`send_text` (used by both ops) does the following before returning success:

1. Pastes the literal message into the recipient pane (no Enter yet).
2. Polls `tmux capture-pane` (last 200 lines) for the unique `id:` marker or a newly-created `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder, up to `SESSION_CHAT_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 4000ms).
3. On success: presses Enter, waits `SESSION_CHAT_SETTLE_MS` (default 300ms), returns 0.
4. On timeout: sends a line-edit clear sequence (`C-e C-u`, `C-a C-k`, `C-e C-u`) to clear the partial paste from the recipient's prompt, returns 1.

This means a failed send **does not leave junk in the recipient's prompt**. If you see "did not land within Xms," the recipient was likely busy in an approval gate or rendering a long TUI frame.

## Durable delivery & orchestrator fan-in

Every `/send` and `/dispatch` is **written to the recipient's durable inbox before the live paste** — under the **recipient runtime's** messages dir: `${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/messages/queue/<recipient>.tsv` for a Claude pane, `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/messages/queue/<recipient>.tsv` for a Codex pane (each runtime only drains its own dir). An exported `SESSION_CHAT_TARGET_MESSAGES_DIR` takes precedence over both and, when set in every participating pane, becomes the shared sender and receiver mailbox root instead. So delivery does not depend on the paste landing while the recipient is busy:

- **Live paste lands** → the message appears in the recipient's prompt now, and the durable copy is removed (no duplicate).
- **Live paste fails** (recipient mid-generation / in an approval gate) → the wrapper prints **"Queued … will arrive on their next turn"** and **exits 0** (the internal send/dispatch function signals the queued path with return code 3; the public `/send` and `/dispatch` wrappers translate that to a normal success exit). The recipient's `UserPromptSubmit` hook drains the inbox on its **next** turn — and the `Stop` hook drains it when the recipient **finishes its current turn**, so even a pane that never submits another prompt surfaces queued messages as soon as it stops working. Nothing is lost. Dedup across the two paths is by the `id:` marker.

Fan-in is covered: when several executors/reviewers ack a busy orchestrator at once, their sends queue on the orchestrator's per-target lock, and any that can't paste live are recovered from the inbox. The send lock **waits for the full per-send budget and resets whenever the queue moves**, so fan-in to one pane does not trip "could not acquire send-lock". For an idle recipient the paste lands immediately; the inbox is the safety net for busy ones.

If a recipient pane sits at an idle prompt (no turn in progress, no prompt coming), neither hook fires; raise `SESSION_CHAT_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS` so the live paste itself succeeds in that case.

## Reply correlation

Skill and command names (`/reply`, `session-chat:reply`) are not shell executables: there is no `reply.sh` or `session-chat reply` command. To reply from a shell, run the installed helper `bash <plugin-root>/scripts/send-message.sh --reply-to <incoming-id> <pane> <message>` (or `dispatch-to-session.sh --reply-to` for a file), substituting the absolute plugin path literally. Under strict-v1, read installed instructions with separate literal read commands (`cat <absolute-path>`); chaining, pipes, and redirection do not qualify for cache read access.

Every `/send` and `/dispatch` has a unique `id:HEX8`. To reply, use **`/reply <pane> <message-id> <message>`** — it prepends the `[re:<id>]` correlation token for you (exactly once) and auto-picks `/send` for a short reply or `/dispatch` for a long/multiline one, so the original sender's `/check-replies` matches it. Do **not** hand-type `[re:<id>]` tokens; pass the `id:<hex>` from the message you're answering and let `/reply` add it. (The raw transports also accept `--reply-to <id>` if you script them directly.) When you ask a peer a question and expect an answer, tell it to `/reply` with your message id; then poll `/check-replies --pending` instead of re-pinging panes that already answered.

## Staging files under a strict-v1 harness

When a session-workspace strict-v1 harness is active and you are a child pane (reviewer, executor, or an environment-scoped coordinator), stage long replies and dispatch prompt files **only** in your own drafts directory inside the granted messages store:

1. Find the store and your name. `/session-workspace:workspace-plan` lists your pane with `grants: messages=<path>`; `/session-chat:whoami` prints your pane name.
2. **No `messages` grant means no staging exception — fail closed.** Do not substitute another staging location: the store top level and `$TMPDIR` are denied, reviewers cannot write anywhere else, and an executor's ordinary checkout write authority is not the staging contract. Do not silently shorten a long reply to fit a single-line send: report that this pane has no `messages` grant, so a multiline dispatch is unavailable (a genuinely short reply may still go out with `send-message.sh --reply-to`).
3. Create the file with the native write tool (Claude `Write`, Codex `apply_patch` Add File) at `<messages-path>/drafts/<your-pane-name>/<name>.md` (or `.txt`). Use a fresh, unique name whose first character is an ASCII letter or digit, followed only by ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-` (at most 128 characters before the extension) that includes a nonce, e.g. `reply-<incoming-id>-<date +%s output>.md`, so a retained or concurrent draft is never overwritten. You may create, edit, and delete only in your own drafts directory. Renames/moves, shell writes (redirection, `tee`, `cp`, `mktemp`), other panes' drafts, files at the store top level, and delivered messages or queue/archive/ledger state are denied.
4. Dispatch it by absolute path: `bash <plugin-root>/scripts/dispatch-to-session.sh --reply-to <incoming-id> <pane> <messages-path>/drafts/<your-pane-name>/<name>.md` (omit `--reply-to` for a new task).
5. **Durable success** (`Dispatched task to …` or `Queued dispatch …`): delete the draft with a native delete tool where one exists (Codex `apply_patch` Delete File). Claude has no native delete tool and shell `rm` into the store is denied, so a Claude pane leaves the draft in place; it is inert (the transport copies the content into a new delivered file and never reads `drafts/`). **Hard failure** (`ERROR:` and non-zero exit): keep the draft, fix the named cause, and retry with the same file.

Nothing sweeps drafts automatically; cleanup of leftovers is an explicit user request. The root orchestrator's existing authority over store files is unchanged.

## Reading complete dispatches under a strict-v1 harness

In `auto` mode the incoming hook inlines at most `SESSION_CHAT_DISPATCH_INLINE_MAX` characters (default 6000) of a trusted dispatch and prints `Full task read command: cat '<absolute-path>'` **before** the body. That cap limits what is displayed, not the task size: never split a task into numbered parts to fit it. `assist` offers the same command only for use after the local user approves; `notify` offers none. Incoming-mode consent rules are unchanged.

With session-workspace 0.10.0, reviewer and executor panes can run that command verbatim. The transport saves every dispatch at the top of the validated messages grant as `<epoch>-<pid>-<id>-<sender>-to-<recipient>.md`, and a read is allowed only when:

- the filename's endpoints resolve to exactly one pair of validated plan panes, with this pane as sender or recipient;
- the file is a private (no group/other bits), owned, single-link regular file directly in the grant, reached with no symlink component or `..` traversal;
- the command is one literal read (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `rg --no-config`, ...) with no pipe, redirection, expansion, glob, `git`, symlink-follow option, or `--files0-from` file list.

Your own existing drafts are readable the same way. Other panes' messages and drafts, queue/archive/ledger state, subdirectories, ungranted provider inboxes, and tool workdirs inside the store are denied, and reviewers no longer get the broad store reads they had before 0.10.0. Recursive reads from an ancestor of the store (`rg`, `find`, `du`, recursive `grep`, `ls -R`, including the implicit cwd) are denied; name explicit subdirectories outside the store instead. Writes remain limited to your own drafts through the native write tool. strict-v1 does not gate Claude's native `Read` tool, so the command above is the portable path for both providers.

## Priorities and TTL

Both `/send` and `/dispatch` (and `/broadcast`) accept `--priority high` and `--ttl <minutes>`:

- `--priority high` — if the message ends up queued (recipient busy), it surfaces **before** normal-priority messages when the recipient's hook drains the inbox. Live delivery is unaffected (it is already immediate). Use for abort signals and gating decisions, not routine status.
- `--ttl <minutes>` — if the message is still sitting in the queue after this window, it is **dropped unsurfaced**. Use for time-sensitive pings whose answer is useless later (e.g. "status now"); never for task dispatches that must eventually run.

## Quoting and shell safety

The wrapper command (`/send`, `/dispatch`) passes the message via shell argv. When constructing the bash invocation:

- Always wrap the message in double quotes.
- Escape embedded `"`, `$`, and backticks, or use single quotes if the payload has none of those.
- Multi-line payloads are not allowed for `/send` — write the full prompt to a temp file and use `dispatch-to-session.sh <target> <file>` (which is what `/dispatch` does internally).

## Tunables

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_CHAT_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS` | 4000 | Max wait per attempt for paste to land in recipient pane. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_SETTLE_MS` | 300 | Settle window after Enter so back-to-back sends don't race. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_SEND_MAX_LEN` | 1024 | Max length for `/send` payload before forcing `/dispatch`. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_SEND_RETRIES` | 2 | Retry count after a verify timeout (total attempts = retries + 1). |
| `SESSION_CHAT_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS` | 200 | Linear backoff base between retries (200ms, 400ms, …). |
| `SESSION_CHAT_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` | derived (~4× per-send budget) | Max wait for the per-target send lock. When unset, auto-sized to the send budget and reset whenever the lock holder changes, so fan-in to one pane queues instead of failing. When set explicitly, it is an **absolute cap** (no reset) so total wait never exceeds it. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_QUEUE_RECOVERY_GRACE_MS` | derived (lock + send budget + 1000ms) | How long a freshly-queued durable row waits before the recipient hook may surface it, giving an in-flight live paste time to win. A known-failed live send marks its row ready immediately. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_RECENT_ID_TTL_MS` | 600000 | How long a surfaced message `id` is remembered so a queued entry and its later live paste never both surface (cross-turn dedup). |
| `SESSION_CHAT_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS` | 30 | How long daily message-archive files are kept for `/message-search`. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_SKIP_VERIFY` | 0 | Set `1` to skip receipt verification (not recommended). |
| `SESSION_CHAT_INCOMING_MODE` | notify | Recipient-side: `auto` / `assist` / `notify` / `off`. Use `/incoming-mode` to inspect or generate the export line. |
| `SESSION_CHAT_TARGET_MESSAGES_DIR` | unset (per-runtime default) | Overrides the local mailbox and every target mailbox; export the same absolute directory in all participating panes before starting their agents, otherwise senders and receivers can resolve different queues. |

## Helper commands

- `/broadcast [--all] [--match GLOB] <text>` — fan out one short message to every named pane (status pings, fleet-wide notices) instead of looping `/send` per pane.
- `/reply <pane> <message-id> <message>` — reply to a received message, auto-correlated: prepends the `[re:<id>]` token and picks `/send` (short) or `/dispatch` (long/multiline) for you. Use this instead of hand-typing `[re:<id>]`.
- `/check-replies [--pending] [--since MIN]` — which sent messages have a correlated reply (via `[re:<id>]` tokens) and which are still `unconfirmed`. This reflects reply **correlation only**, not the recipient's task progress or liveness — an `unconfirmed` row does not mean the pane is stuck; use `/pane-health` to check liveness.
- `/pane-health [name] [--all]` — liveness, inbox backlog, and lock state per named pane; catches dead/duplicate panes before sends time out against them.
- `/message-search <pattern> [--days N] [--peer NAME]` — search the message archive (every sent + surfaced incoming message, 200-char excerpts, 30-day retention via `SESSION_CHAT_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS`) plus full dispatch bodies.
- `/incoming-mode` — show or set `SESSION_CHAT_INCOMING_MODE` (prints an `export` line to `eval`).
- `/messages-list` — read-only inventory of dispatch files under `${SESSION_CHAT_TARGET_MESSAGES_DIR:-${CLAUDE_HOME:-~/.claude}/messages}`.
- `/messages-clean` — delete old dispatch files (dry-run by default; pass `--apply` to actually delete).

## Common failure modes

- **"pane 'X' is at a shell prompt"** — the recipient's agent exited; the message would have been executed by their shell. Restart the agent in that pane (set `SESSION_CHAT_ALLOW_SHELL_TARGET=1` only for deliberate shell targets, e.g. tests).
- **"This pane has no name"** — run `/whoami <name>` in the sending pane first.
- **"No pane named X"** — run `/panes all` to see registered names across tmux sessions; the recipient may not have run `/whoami`.
- **"Multiple panes named X"** — duplicate names exist; rename one with `/whoami` in that pane.
- **"did not land within Xms after N attempts"** — recipient busy through retries. The message is **not lost**: it's in the recipient's durable inbox and will surface on their next turn (the sender reports "Queued …"). To make more sends land *live*, raise `SESSION_CHAT_VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS` or `SESSION_CHAT_SEND_RETRIES`.
- **"could not acquire send-lock"** — another sender is targeting the same pane. Will resolve when they finish; raise `SESSION_CHAT_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` if you need to wait longer.
- **Dispatch lands but recipient never acts** — recipient is in `INCOMING_MODE=notify` (default). They were told not to read the file. Run `/incoming-mode auto` (or `assist`) in the recipient's shell.

## Reload after install

Plugin updates do not auto-reload running sessions. After `claude plugin update session-chat@girishattri-plugins`:

1. The new version is unpacked under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/girishattri-plugins/session-chat/<version>/`. Confirm with `ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/girishattri-plugins/session-chat/`.
2. Reload in the current session: `/reload-plugins`. This switches the plugin's hooks, commands, skills, and any MCP/LSP servers to the new version's path without a restart. Only monitors need a full session restart.
3. Verify: `/panes` and `/incoming-mode` should respond from the new version. If `/incoming-mode` is "unknown command," reload didn't pick up the new commands — check the cache path, then restart Claude Code as the fallback.

What a reload does **not** refresh: environment variables the pane inherited at launch (`SESSION_CHAT_INCOMING_MODE`, `SESSION_CHAT_TARGET_MESSAGES_DIR`, the context and scheduler homes). Changing those still requires relaunching the pane with the new environment.

For a plugin loaded in place from a local-directory marketplace (development checkouts), edits to `SKILL.md` apply immediately; edits to hooks or scripts apply at the next `/reload-plugins` or session start, with no version bump.

For codex-side parity, run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade girishattri-plugins`, then start a **new Codex session** so the update is loaded. Its cache is under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/...`.
