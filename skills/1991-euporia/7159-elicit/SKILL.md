# Euporia Protocol

Resolve abstract aporia by surfacing the decisions an intent turns on until the person recognizes the intent as theirs. Type: `(AbstractAporia, Hybrid, REVERSE-INDUCE-CYCLE, IntentSeed) → ResolvedEndpoint`.

## Definition

**Euporia** (εὐπορία): A dialogical act of opening a way through abstract aporia — the person holds a direction but cannot name up front which decisions it turns on. The AI traces those decision coordinates from the person's own material, from their words, and from the decision structure of the domain the intent sits in, and surfaces each with where it comes from and what leaving it open changes. What is surfaced is focus: re-read every turn, it decides nothing. Only the person's words move a value from focus into the record, and each recorded value carries who proposed it and how it came to stand; what is still open is carried as residual. The run closes when the person says the intent is aligned enough — every coordinate need not be filled — or when they withdraw. The resolution establishes the person's recognized intent, not the factual correctness of its parts.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

Euporia(I) → start(c) → elicit(c, utterances), where c is the fused session context:
  surface(c): the read-back of the intent as understood, with its sources → Stop
  next utterance u: c' := fuse(c, u), every reading below taken afresh on c' →
    [the utterance does not bear on this run]      the session answers it; no gate of this run
    [the person withdraws]                         → Withdrawn

    [otherwise]                                    → surface(c')
  no utterance: the gate holds; nothing is taken
  after a resolution: the next move the person declared — the seed's task included — is the
    session's to take up; after a withdrawal: only a next move the person declares with it

/-- The deficit: the person holds a direction but has not fixed which decisions it turns on — a
    coordinate that their material, their words, or the decision structure of the domain the intent
    sits in raises is still open. Invoking `/elicit` is the person's declaration of it, and you do
    not judge it away. **Your judgment** on the AI-guided path only, as the entry judgment: finding
    none means not starting, which leaves no outcome of this protocol; finding it makes the first
    surface a proposal the person confirms or declines. -/

/-- **Your judgment**, the live inventory: every coordinate the intent turns on that this run has
    raised and the person's words have not since retired or merged — read over the whole fused
    context: the seed, every answer, what reads of the person's material returned, and the
    decision structure of the domain the intent sits in. A coordinate raised once stays here
    whether or not the current surface shows it; the person may add, merge, reword, or retire any
    coordinate, the axis itself included. Whether a reworded coordinate is the same coordinate is
    your judgment; rewording it does not drop the value that stands on it. Guidance for the reading, not steps it must take: read
    the person's material where the intent turns on it rather than from scratch each round, and a
    coordinate whose basis is still thin may wait before it is raised. -/
axiom coordinates : Context P → List Entry

/-- Who first put a value forward: you, or the person. -/
inductive Proposer | draft | person

/-- What the turn that made a value stand did: gave it in its own words, took a value put forward
    before, or gave a grant that reaches your choice. -/
inductive Standing | set | adopted | granted

/-- What stands on a coordinate: the value, who first put it forward, and how it came to stand. -/
structure Determination where
  value    : Entry
  proposer : Proposer
  standing : Standing

/-- **Your judgment**, the record rule: the cited turn makes coordinate `x` stand as `d`, read
    against the context as it now stands, on the scope the turn's words reach. Who proposed the
    value and how it stood are read separately. The proposer is whoever first put the value forward
    in the context, however the cited turn words it; a value you drew from evidence or from the
    person's material and put to them was put forward by you. The standing is what the cited turn
    itself did: gave the value in its own words (`set`) — a person repeating their own earlier
    value keeps it `set`; took a value put forward before (`adopted`) —
    where you put it forward, only if it was visible as yours, with what decides it and your
    contrary grounds, before this turn; or gave a grant whose words reach your choice (`granted`).
    An addition of yours the person did not see — a default for an unanswered coordinate, a merge,
    a rejected alternative or a reason they did not state, a question read as a decision — stands
    on nothing and stays your proposal, unless a grant whose words reach it covers it. A question, a request to look
    something up, an observation, a deferral, or a bare mention makes nothing stand. The value is in the words of
    the turn that set it, or of the proposal as it was shown; a read-back that paraphrases never
    replaces it, and never turns the person's value into an adoption. -/
axiom StandingSupported : Entry → Context P → Turn P → Determination → Prop

    person; it fills no coordinate here. -/

  { admits := (·.val = .person), supports := StandingSupported x }

/-- **Your reading**: how coordinate `x` stands in `c` — filled by the person's latest turn that
    makes it stand; open where none does, carrying as candidate only a turn of the person's or
    evidence that points toward a value not yet taken. A value a person's turn made stand changes
    only by their later words: evidence against it is shown — before any step that depends on it
    and cannot be undone — and the value stands. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the latest utterance bears on this run — a value, a deferral, a question
    about the surface, a new frame, a withdrawal, a resolution. An utterance about other work
    leaves the run as it stands: the session answers it, that answer stays in the context, and no
    gate of this run is raised. An AI-guided run the person has not confirmed has not started:
    nothing they say is recorded into it. -/
axiom Reaches : Context P → Prop

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn says the intent is aligned enough — the aporia is resolved —
    read against the context as it now stands. It closes the run: coordinates need not all be
    filled, and what is open is residual. Filled coordinates, or your own reading, close nothing.
    Whether an earlier resolution still reaches what is now at issue is read on the current
    context: a later question may reopen the alignment, ask only about a fact, or concern other
    work. -/

/-- Only the person settles the intent. -/

axiom resolution : (c : Context P) → Occ (resolutionCoord (P := P)) c

/-- **Your record**: the contrary grounds you presented before the answer that closes — a value
    you doubt, a premise that may not hold, a sibling deficit you read — attached to the closure;
    empty when there were none. -/
axiom dissent : Context P → List String

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn withdraws — the person stops here without resolving the
    intent, and nothing open is delegated — read against the context as it now stands. Stopping
    needs nothing else; the values carried into the partial record stand under the record rule
    alone. Whether an earlier withdrawal still reaches this run is read on the current context: a
    withdrawal from an earlier run, or a declined proposal, does not close a new one. Your own
    reading that the run should end closes nothing. -/
axiom WithdrawalSupported : Context P → Turn P → Unit → Prop

/-- Only the person withdraws. -/
def withdrawalCoord : Coord P Unit :=

/-- **Your reading**: the person's withdrawal; `open_` until one reaches it. -/
axiom withdrawal : (c : Context P) → Occ (withdrawalCoord (P := P)) c

    how it came to stand, what is still open, and the dissent attached to the closure. -/

Convergence evidence: at the resolution, present the read-back of the intent in the person's

the turn that set it → who proposed it and how it stood — beside the residual and the dissent
attached to the closure. Demonstrated, not asserted.

  | .read         => (.observe, "artifact read, artifact search, record read: read-only reads of the person's own material where the intent turns on it")
  | .trace        => (.sense, "Internal analysis: the live inventory over the whole fused context and the domain's decision structure, each coordinate with where it comes from and what leaving it open changes")
  | .surface      => (.interaction .constitution, "a plain one-sentence read-back of the intent as understood, every round the first included, with its sources and each recorded value marked by who proposed it and how it stood; each open coordinate the round shows, with its question, where it comes from — the person's material cited, their words quoted as said without an unstated mental model, or the domain's decision structure marked as yours — what leaving it open changes, and any default as your proposal; your contrary grounds before the answer slots. Guidance for the showing: coordinates the domain raises come after the ones the person's material and words raise, as open questions rather than filled examples; a deferred coordinate returns in the same wording with the same basis, marked as returning. The answer may give values, defer, say the intent is aligned enough, or withdraw, in any form; an answer beyond the slots joins the context whole")

  | .withdraw     => (.interaction .extension, "at the person's word, at any gate: what you took as withdrawn, and the partial record — the recorded values with who proposed each and how it stood, and the residual; nothing open is delegated, and the person's next words correct it")
  | .seam         => (.interaction .extension, "after a resolution, proceed to the next move the person declared — the task the seed asked for, or other work they named; after a withdrawal, only to a next move the person declared with it, never the seed's task; cite that source; this protocol declares no wired outbound edge, and every Constitution gate fires unchanged")

## Scope Boundary

Euporia surfaces the decision coordinates an intent turns on without adjudicating which sibling protocol owns them. A coordinate that exposes a missing fact, an undefined boundary, or an unrecognizable direction remains a coordinate with its basis; a fact claim you add from the domain's practice is shown as your unverified judgment. The user decides what to reach for next.

## Mode Activation

`/elicit` remains directly invocable: the invocation declares the deficit the Definition's `aporia` names, and the first surface shows the intent as understood with its sources — the user may say at once that it is aligned enough. On the AI-guided path the first surface is a proposal the user confirms or declines; a decline is a withdrawal, and until the user confirms, the run has not started. Skip AI-guided activation when the user explicitly asks to proceed without surfacing, or when the same utterance was resolved or withdrawn in this session.

## Protocol

### Phase 2 surface

Present what TOOL GROUNDING's `surface` entry names and yield the turn. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when a term must remain stable across the session, wording must travel unchanged, material belongs to another round or trace, or phase order determines whether text belongs before or inside the gate.

### Intensity

| Level | When | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| Light | One open coordinate | Brief surface and per-coordinate slots |
| Medium | Several coordinates or partial evidence | Full surface at coordinate granularity |
| Heavy | Many coordinates, weak basis, several rounds in prospect | Full surface with per-coordinate evidence and explicit residuals |

## Rules

- **Recognition over Recall**: Present the coordinates an intent turns on with their anticipatable post-answer states, so the user recognizes what they would otherwise have to recall.
- **Round composition**: Use everyday language, keep each judgment beside its nearest evidence and next-move implication, and place analytical context before the answer slots.
- **Focus and record**: As the Definition's MORPHISM invariant and `record` state.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request and carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
