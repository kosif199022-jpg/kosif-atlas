# Developer-disk space reclamation on macOS.
#
# Two tiers, because they have different owners and different blast radii:
#
#   PROJECT tier — each project's regenerable build output, by the toolchain
#                  that owns it; re-created by the next build. Flutter today
#                  (`flutter clean`: build/ + .dart_tool/).
#   GLOBAL  tier — machine-wide developer caches shared by every project:
#                  Xcode derived data, the Dart analysis server cache,
#                  simulator scratch, superseded Gradle version caches, and
#                  orphaned flutter_tools.* build scratch left in TMPDIR by a
#                  killed or crashed flutter build/run/test/pub.
#
# Everything here regenerates. It never touches source, git, Xcode Archives,
# signing assets, or a project's generated code (`*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`,
# `lib/generated/`, `assets/renderer/` all survive `flutter clean` — verified).
#
# WHY `rm -rf` AND NOT `trash`: the point is to free space. A trash on the same
# APFS volume frees NOTHING until the bin is emptied, and emptying it is
# TCC-protected (a human has to press it). Guards that make the rm safe:
# dry-run by default, a "$HOME/"-prefix assertion before every delete, literal
# path lists, and a fail-closed scan for the Gradle tier.
#
# WHY IT REPORTS A df DELTA AND NOT THE du TOTALS: `du` counts APFS
# copy-on-write clones once per clone. Measured 2026-08-07: XCTestDevices read
# 8.0G under `du` and freed EXACTLY ZERO bytes when deleted, because every block
# was shared with CoreSimulator/Devices. Only the change in free space is real,
# so that is the number this script prints. Believe the delta, not the estimate.
#
# Usage:
#   reclaim-space                  # DRY RUN — list targets + sizes, delete nothing
#   reclaim-space --yes            # reclaim (project tier = cwd, + global tier)
#   reclaim-space --yes --all-projects   # every project under the scan root
#   reclaim-space --yes --global-only    # skip the project tier
#   reclaim-space --yes --project-only   # skip machine-wide caches
#   reclaim-space --help
#
# Env:
#   RECLAIM_SCAN_ROOT   where to look for sibling projects (default: $HOME/GitHub)

# machine to go quiet did exactly that, so this refused while nothing was
# building — and the waiter was waiting on a condition it was itself preventing.
