  Developer-disk reclamation on macOS, per toolchain present: PROJECT
  (regenerable build output in each project — Flutter's `flutter clean` today)
  and GLOBAL (Xcode DerivedData, Dart analysis cache, simulator scratch,
  superseded Gradle caches, orphaned `flutter_tools.*` scratch). Everything it
  touches regenerates. Also denies `git worktree add` under a free-disk floor.
  TRIGGER: reclaim / free disk space · clean caches · 清理空間 · 硬碟快滿了 ·

# reclaim-space

Build output and toolchain caches pile up by the gigabyte and nothing else
removes them. This is the sweep: each tier belongs to one toolchain and runs
only where that toolchain's files are.

```bash
reclaim-space                        # DRY RUN — list targets, delete nothing
reclaim-space --yes                  # reclaim (project tier = cwd, + global tier)
reclaim-space --yes --all-projects   # every project under the scan root
reclaim-space --yes --global-only    # skip the project tier
```

A new tier is one toolchain's regenerable output, with the guards every tier
has (see "Finding the next leak").

The command is on PATH whenever this plugin is enabled. `RECLAIM_SCAN_ROOT`
overrides where sibling projects are looked for (default `$HOME/GitHub`).

## Believe the delta, not the estimate

The per-target sizes in the listing are `du` output, and **`du` counts an APFS
copy-on-write clone once per clone**. Measured 2026-08-07: XCTest device clones
read 8.0G under `du` and freed exactly zero bytes when deleted, every block
being shared with the real device set. Only the change in free space is real, so
that is the number the live run prints and the only one worth reporting to
anyone. A target whose estimate dwarfs the delta is a clone, not a leak — do not
go hunting for the "missing" space.

## Worktrees are in the project tier

`--all-projects` sweeps each repo **and each of its `.claude/worktrees/*`**. A
worktree is a full checkout: measured 2026-09-01, six of them held **12.7G**, of
which `build/` was about three quarters — more than the machine had free. None
of it needs deleting to reclaim: `build/` regenerates, so every branch, every
unmerged commit and every uncommitted file survives the sweep.

This matters beyond tidiness. `/System/Volumes/VM`, where macOS writes swap,
shares an APFS container with these checkouts (same `/dev/disk3s6`, same free
pool). **Free disk is swap headroom**, and on a 16G machine swap is what stands
between several concurrent test suites and a watchdog reboot. The
`disk-floor` hook refuses a new worktree below a free-space floor for that
reason, and points here — only where `/System/Volumes/VM` exists; elsewhere
(Linux, a cloud VM) there is no shared swap volume and it allows.

## Orphaned build scratch in TMPDIR

`flutter_tools.*` in `$TMPDIR` is Flutter's own scratch space for build, run,
test and pub — kernel snapshots, asset-bundle work. A clean exit deletes it;
a killed or crashed flutter process (a hung build force-quit, a `run` session
that never got `q`, a CI-style invocation that got SIGKILLed) leaves it
behind, and nothing else ever revisits TMPDIR to notice.
Measured 2026-09-08: 641 orphaned dirs held **57G** on one machine, more than
every other GLOBAL entry combined, and it wasn't `reclaim-space` that found
it — see "Finding the next leak" below.

TMPDIR is shared with everything else on the box (browsers, IDEs, other
language toolchains), so liveness for this tier is checked with `lsof` on the
exact directory, not a flutter-process-name guess: a live build under a
process name this script doesn't already pattern-match (`pub`, `attach`,
`analyze`, a future Flutter internal rename) would otherwise get its
in-progress scratch deleted out from under it. A directory still open is
reported as skipped, not silently left off the list, so a live run's output
accounts for every `flutter_tools.*` entry it saw.

## Finding the next leak

This skill's tiers are a fixed list; the machine's actual disk use is not.
When `reclaim-space --yes --all-projects` still isn't enough — the TMPDIR
tier above was found exactly this way, not by anyone remembering TMPDIR was
a candidate — the method is:

1. `du -h -d 1 "$HOME"` (BSD `du` takes `-d`, never combine it with `-s`),
   then `sort -rh` mentally (BSD `sort` has no `-h`) or just eyeball the
   biggest few. Drill into anything surprisingly large with another `-d 1`
   one level deeper. Repeat until a directory's *contents*, not just its
   name, explain its size.
2. Check `$TMPDIR` specifically — `du -h -d 1 "$HOME"` never sees it, because
   it isn't under `$HOME` (it's `/var/folders/<hash>/T` on macOS). It is the
   one blind spot every tier above already accounts for except this one, and
   the 57G measurement lived there.
3. Before treating anything as deletable: is it a tool's own regenerable
   scratch/cache, not user data? Is anything live holding it open —
   `lsof +D <dir>`, not a process-name grep, because a name-based guess is
   exactly the gap #2 above exists to close. `pgrep` for a known daemon
   (Gradle, xcodebuild) is fine when the *tier itself* IS that daemon's
   cache; for a shared, multi-tenant location like TMPDIR it isn't
   sufficient on its own.
4. A one-off finding gets cleaned by hand and forgotten. A **recurring**
   category — something that will be back because the
   tool that made it will run again — belongs as a new tier in
   `scripts/reclaim_space.sh`, with the same guards every existing tier has:
   dry-run-by-default, a path-prefix assertion before every delete, and a
   liveness check that doesn't trust a name.

## What it refuses, and why it fails closed

Deleting a Gradle cache under a live daemon, derived data under a running
`xcodebuild`, or a project's `.dart_tool/` and `build/` under a **running test
suite**, corrupts the work in progress. All are cheap to detect, so a live run
refuses outright rather than racing.

The Gradle tier derives the live version set by scanning every project's
`gradle-wrapper.properties`; a hardcoded version goes stale silently and then
deletes a cache someone is mid-build against. **If the scan finds no project at
all it skips the tier entirely** — an empty scan means "cannot know", never
"nothing is in use".

## Deliberate omissions

Two things it will not clean, both because the cost lands on the next build
rather than on disk:

- **`~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm`** — the shared SPM download cache that
  `build/ios/SourcePackages` is populated from. Clearing it turns the next iOS
  build into a network re-download, for well under a gigabyte.
- **`flutter pub get` after the clean** — a closed-out feature line does not
  need a resolved project, so the next session that opens it does the pub get.
  Note the reason is workflow, **not** space: pub-get does re-populate
  `build/ios/SourcePackages`, but that directory is largely an APFS clone of
  `~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm`, so its 1.3–1.7G `du` size costs only
  ~0.1G of real disk on a warm cache. Do not defend this choice with the `du`
  figure — it is the same clone illusion described above.

It deletes with `rm -rf` rather than `trash` because a trash on the same APFS
volume frees nothing until the bin is emptied, and emptying it is TCC-protected.
The guards that make that safe are dry-run-by-default, a `$HOME/`- (or, for the
TMPDIR tier, `$FLUTTER_TMP/`-) prefix assertion before every delete, and
literal path lists.
