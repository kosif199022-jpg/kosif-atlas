# Tmpfile Pattern

<!-- `/tmp` is the filesystem temp directory, not a skill in this repository. -->
<!-- validate-plugins: ignore /tmp -->

Use tmpfiles when passing long content to git or `gh` CLI commands. This keeps Bash commands short and prevents Claude Code permission prompts triggered by complex-looking command strings.

## When to Use

- PR bodies (`gh pr create --body-file`)
- Issue bodies (`gh issue create --body-file`)
- Release notes (`gh release create --notes-file`)
- Review replies (script `--body-file` flags)
- Any `gh` subcommand that reads content from a file flag, such as `--body-file` or `--notes-file`, when the content runs to more than a few lines

## Four-Step Workflow

### 1. Create the tmpfile

Generate a unique path with `mktemp -u`, under `$TMPDIR`:

```bash
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gh-pr-body-XXXXXX"
# Returns a unique path that does NOT exist on disk, e.g.: /tmp/claude-501/gh-pr-body-x4y5z6
```

**Target `$TMPDIR`, never a literal `/tmp`.** When Bash runs inside the Claude Code sandbox, `/tmp` is unwritable and so is the per-user temp directory that `mktemp` picks by default, while `$TMPDIR` points at a directory the sandbox permits. Outside the sandbox `$TMPDIR` is the ordinary per-user temp directory, so the one form works in both cases. Three ways to get this wrong, all of which fail with `Operation not permitted` under the sandbox:

| Form                               | Why it fails                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mktemp -u /tmp/gh-pr-body-XXXXXX` | macOS resolves `/tmp` to `/private/tmp`, which the sandbox denies         |
| `mktemp -u`                        | no template, so macOS uses `confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR)`            |
| `mktemp -ut gh-pr-body`            | `-t` also ignores `$TMPDIR` on macOS and uses the same per-user directory |

Only an explicit template under `$TMPDIR` is safe. Use the `:-/tmp` fallback rather than bare `${TMPDIR}`: on the rare shell that leaves `$TMPDIR` unset, a bare expansion resolves to `/gh-pr-body-XXXXXX` and tries to write at the filesystem root. macOS usually sets `$TMPDIR` with a trailing slash, so the expansion can produce a doubled slash mid-path, which every POSIX filesystem treats as one separator.

**The `-u` flag is required.** Without it, `mktemp` creates an empty file at the path it prints, and the Write tool refuses to overwrite a file it has not Read first (`File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.`). Since the file is empty by construction there is no reason to Read it, so plain `mktemp` forces a pointless Read or leaves the write to fail. With `-u`, the path is unique but unoccupied, so Write creates it fresh.

**`-u` is not equally cheap on both platforms.** GNU `mktemp -u` (`--dry-run`) prints a name without touching the filesystem. macOS `mktemp(1)` creates the file with `mkstemp(3)` and unlinks it before exiting, so it still needs write permission at the target path. Both leave nothing on disk at the path they print, which is all this pattern needs, but the macOS behavior is why the directory has to be writable even though the file is not meant to survive.

**Caveat:** `-u` does not atomically reserve the name, which is why both man pages call it "unsafe" and discourage it in general. The trade-off is acceptable here because the Write follows immediately and the content is a PR, issue, or release body rather than a secret. Do not carry this pattern over to security-sensitive temp files; for those, use plain `mktemp` and write through a shell redirect instead of the Write tool.

Use a descriptive prefix that reflects the purpose (`gh-pr-body`, `gh-issue-body`, `copilot-reply`, etc.). On macOS/BSD, `mktemp` only replaces trailing `X` characters, so the template must end with the `XXXXXX` run (do not add suffixes like `.md` after it). That trailing `XXXXXX` is replaced by `mktemp` with random characters. Always capture the returned path and use it in subsequent commands.

### 2. Write content with the Write tool

Use the Write tool (not `echo` or `cat`) to write the full content to the path returned by `mktemp -u`. The Write tool handles multiline content natively and keeps the subsequent Bash command short.

### 3. Pass the file flag to the command

Run the `gh` command with `--body-file` (or `--notes-file`, for `gh release create`) pointing to the path returned by `mktemp -u` (shown as `TMPFILE` below), in a **separate message** issued only after the Write tool has returned:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add user authentication" --body-file TMPFILE
```

### 4. Verify the stored body

A zero exit from `gh` says nothing about whether the body landed. If the file was missing or empty when `gh` read it, the pull request, issue, or release is created anyway, with an empty body, and still prints a URL. Confirm the stored body is non-empty before cleaning up.

**Run this step only when the create command succeeded and printed a URL.** If it failed, nothing was created, there is no identifier to pass, and you must skip straight to cleanup. Never substitute a placeholder or a URL left over from an earlier run.

Pass the URL the create command just returned, shown below as `<url>`:

```bash
gh pr view <url> --json body --jq '.body | length'
```

```bash
gh issue view <url> --json body --jq '.body | length'
```

If the length is `0`, re-write `TMPFILE` with the Write tool and then, as a separate call, edit the body in place:

```bash
gh pr edit <url> --body-file TMPFILE
```

Re-run the length check to confirm the recovery worked. Cleanup comes after verification, since recovery needs the file to still exist.

## Never Batch the Write With the Command

Issue the Write call (step 2) and the `gh` call (step 3) as two separate, sequential messages. Wait for Write to return before invoking `gh`.

`gh` reads the body file at invocation time. If both calls go out in a single parallel batch, `gh` can run before the file exists and will create the pull request, issue, or release with an **empty body**. That is a silent failure: the command still succeeds and still prints a URL, so it is only caught later, by hand.

This is a deliberate exception to the general preference for parallel tool calls. That preference applies to calls with no dependencies between them. These two have a dependency: the `gh` file flag (`--body-file`, `--notes-file`, and the like) consumes the file that Write produces.

## Cleanup

Issue cleanup as a **separate Bash tool call** after the `gh` command, and after the verification above when one ran:

```bash
rm -f TMPFILE
```

Each Bash tool invocation runs unconditionally, so the cleanup runs whether the `gh` command succeeded or failed, and the `gh` command's exit code is preserved by the harness without any shell-level wrapping.

Do not chain the cleanup onto the `gh` command, and do not wrap it to preserve the exit code. In particular, never write:

```bash
# BAD - breaks in zsh
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file TMPFILE; status=$?; rm -f TMPFILE; exit $status
```

In zsh (the macOS default shell), `status` and `pipestatus` are read-only built-in aliases for `$?` and `${pipestatus[@]}`. Assigning to either fails with `read-only variable: status`, so this wrapper exits non-zero and mis-reports a successful `gh` call as failed. Keep cleanup in its own Bash tool call instead.

**A cleanup allow rule has to match the expanded path.** The `mktemp` call runs with `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` still in its command text, so a permission rule can quote that expression verbatim and match. Cleanup is different: `TMPFILE` is replaced with the literal path `mktemp` printed, so the command reads `rm -f /tmp/claude-501/gh-pr-body-x4y5z6`, and a rule written against the expression never matches it. Scope the cleanup rule by the distinctive filename prefix instead, and keep the expression form only on the `mktemp` rule:

```json
"Bash(mktemp -u \"${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gh-pr-body-*\")", "Bash(rm -f *gh-pr-body-*)"
```

Pinning the cleanup rule to a directory does not work, because `$TMPDIR` differs between the sandbox and an ordinary shell: it is `/tmp/claude-501/` in one and something like `/var/folders/xx/.../T/` in the other. The filename prefix is the part that stays constant, so it is what the rule keys on.

## Examples

### GitHub issue

```bash
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gh-issue-body-XXXXXX"
# Returns: /tmp/claude-501/gh-issue-body-a1b2c3
```

Write body content via the Write tool to the returned path, then, in a separate message:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Fix login timeout" --body-file /tmp/claude-501/gh-issue-body-a1b2c3 --label "bug"
```

```bash
rm -f /tmp/claude-501/gh-issue-body-a1b2c3
```

### Pull request

```bash
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gh-pr-body-XXXXXX"
# Returns: /tmp/claude-501/gh-pr-body-x4y5z6
```

Write PR body via the Write tool to the returned path, then, in a separate message:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add retry logic to API client" --body-file /tmp/claude-501/gh-pr-body-x4y5z6
```

```bash
rm -f /tmp/claude-501/gh-pr-body-x4y5z6
```

### Review reply

```bash
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/copilot-reply-XXXXXX"
# Returns a unique path, e.g.: /tmp/claude-501/copilot-reply-r7s8t9
```

Write reply via the Write tool to the returned path, then, in a separate message, pass it to the reply command with `--body-file`.

## Anti-Patterns

**Never pipe content inline:**

```bash
# BAD - triggers permission prompts
echo "Long body content..." | gh issue create --title "Title" --body-file -
```

**Never use `--body` with long inline content:**

```bash
# BAD - long string triggers permission prompts
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "## Summary\n\n- Change 1\n- Change 2\n..."
```

**Never use HEREDOC for long `gh` arguments:**

```bash
# BAD - HEREDOC with long content still triggers prompts
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "$(cat << 'EOF'
## Summary

- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3
EOF
)"
```

The tmpfile pattern is always safer for content that might exceed a few lines.
