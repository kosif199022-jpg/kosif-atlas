# Analogia Protocol

Audit what a mapping licenses: on the question the person's own words set, collect to the limit of your reach over what the mapping rests on, construct the correspondences between the source structure and the target, warrant each fit claim from evidence the protocol can cite, and report for each conclusion at stake whether it holds, is blocked, or stays undetermined. Type: `(MappingUncertain, AI, GROUND, R) → MappingAssessment`.

## Definition

**Analogia** (ἀναλογία): A dialogical act of auditing analogical inference. A mapping — a framework, an analogy, an earlier design, an abstraction — is being relied on, and what it licenses about the target is unclear: the feeling that it fits does not tell which conclusions it supports. The person's own words set the question: what the comparison is for, the conclusions at stake, and which source and which target where that choice is open; the AI may draft it, and only the person's turn makes it stand. The AI then collects to the limit of its own reach over what the mapping rests on — the source's relations and their counterparts in the target, reading any account it can reach itself — names the places it reached and those it could not, constructs the correspondences, warrants each fit claim against evidence with what would defeat it, and reports for each conclusion the source relation that carries it, what was checked and found, what difference would break it, and whether it holds and how far, is blocked, or stays undetermined with what is missing and who can reach it. What remains open is shown as the person's own unknown. The person's utterance supplies grounds and records what they adopt; it never promotes a claim to warranted, because assent is not evidence about the world. An assessment establishes no correctness beyond the evidence it cites, and a blocked conclusion is not thereby false.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

/-- The question an audit answers: what the comparison is for, the conclusions at stake (`K`), and
    the source and target — carried only where `R` and the context leave a materially different
    choice of either open, `none` where they fix it — with who first put it forward and how it

structure Question where
  purpose     : String

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn establishes question `q` in `c`, in the whole scope that turn
    asks — a turn asking about A and B supports no question narrowed to A — with conclusions to
    audit. Where the purpose is to carry a structure over — a port, a migration, a sibling's shape
    — and the turn asks nothing narrower, the conclusion is that the structure is preserved in the
    target; the relations under it are what collection finds, never a list fixed here. A narrower
    question the turn asks — whether the retries will match, say — is that turn's whole scope.
    Articulating what a stated purpose entails is reading it; choosing among materially different
    purposes, conclusions, or source–target pairs is not, and a pair `R` or a fact fixes is read,
    not asked. The question stands only on the person's turn that sets it in their own words
    (`set`) or takes a draft you put forward, as it was or corrected (`adopted`); a draft counts
    only where it was visible as yours, with its grounds, before that turn. A draft alone is a
    proposal, and an instruction to do the next task takes none. Several drafts a turn takes
    establish a question only where their whole scope is one pair's, without your choosing,
    dropping, or conflating pairs; otherwise the question stays open. -/

    evidence as expected under either reading supports neither. A turn of any admitted origin bears

axiom partition : (c : Context P) → selfGrounding c → Option (PartitionReading c)

/-- **Your collection** from `c`, to the limit of your own reach, over what the mapping rests on:
    the source's relations and their counterparts in the target, the checks on the fit claims
    bearing on `K`, and every one collection exposes; where to look is yours to judge, and no list
    of sources bounds it. A source or target account you can reach, you read yourself, and what
    you say you read, you read whole. Each place you look returns an evidence turn, a null result
    included, so the places looked stay in the context by name. Where collected
    material conflicts, name what conflicts with what and show it, not only as a check's grounds.
    What the context already holds from a source is not fetched again unless an utterance,
    evidence, or your own work since says it changed. Read and run without changing existing state;
    what you create only to look you remove afterwards. An observation that needs to change
    existing state, someone's permission, or another's authority is not made and leaves no evidence
    turn: name it, with what it needs, in what you present, and leave it open. Where a claim turns
    on what an artifact does, exercise it over the case that separates the readings. Collection
    includes trying the construction it needs: a reachable check that constructing the
    correspondences over what was collected exposes is run within collection as well. What is
    still open once collection ends is shown as the person's own unknown. Direction:
    `references/judgments.md` §collection. -/

def collect (c : Context P) : Context P := c ++ (observe c).map (·.val)

/-- **Your judgment**: the latest utterance, read whole against `R` and the fused context, bears on
    this audit — a purpose, a conclusion, a source or target, a fact, a source to read, a
    counterexample, a result from running something. One that bears on none of it leaves the audit
    as it stands: the session answers it, that answer stays in the context, and no pass opens.
    Adopting or setting aside a conclusion alone opens no pass: it moves no warrant or verdict,
    and the session acknowledges it — reading `preference` for that conclusion and showing the
    adoption apart from its verdict; an adoption over a Blocked or Undetermined verdict is shown as
    accepted and evidentially disputed, with those grounds visible. Taking a drafted question, or
    setting the question in the person's own words, makes it stand and opens a pass. A turn that
    brings this audit a relevant new ground — a fact, a source, a counterexample, a result — bears
    on it whatever its grammatical form, a question included; a question about this audit opens a
    pass unless the current grounds answer it entirely; a question about other work is the
    session's. -/

/-- What an assessment carries, read off the contract's own readings over the collected context:

Every utterance is read whole against the context as it now stands: nothing counts passes or
reconstructions, and no earlier reading is held apart from what later turns say. A changed
purpose, conclusion, source or target, or a new ground is simply the context the next pass reads;
evidence already gathered stays in the context, and every verdict is judged again over the
question that now stands. Silence takes nothing: the last outcome stands, and a waiting question
stays open. Adoption changes no warrant or verdict. Stopping in the middle of a pass is the
harness's interrupt.

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
assessed: a pass in which the question stood on the person's turn, collection reached what it
could, and every conclusion in K carries a verdict — Licensed with its limits, Blocked, or
Undetermined naming what is missing and who can reach it. Undetermined does not block the
assessment and is not settled by it; a check this session can reach and has not run is run, not
reported Undetermined. Convergence evidence: the question with the person's turn it stands on,
who first put it forward, and whether that turn set it or took a draft —
the purpose, K, and the source and target audited, with the turn or fact that fixed them or the
person's answer where the choice was open; for each k in K, one pair
(MappingUncertain(k) → verdict(k)) showing the source relation that carries it, the
correspondences it rode on, the likenesses, the differences in both directions, and the unknowns;
for each checked fit claim, its label, warrant (`Check.warrant`), and scope beside the grounds,
the stated defeater, the reach or its absence, whether the check was unmet, survived, or
failed, and any materially different explanation the evidence fits as well; correspondences
outside the checked scope named as outside it; the places collection
reached and those it did not, by name; where collected material conflicts, what conflicts with
what; what is still open, as the person's own unknown. An unmet
check is reported as unmet, never as a pass; a claim whose warrant is open is named open rather
than weakly supported. Adoption is reported apart from warrant and never as a reason; a
conclusion adopted over a Blocked or Undetermined verdict is shown as accepted and evidentially
disputed. Carry any change to the question, distinguishing conclusions removed from scope from
conclusions answered. Under self-grounding, append the partition reading with its grounds, or
what its basis is missing. Demonstrated, not asserted.

## Mode Activation

`/ground` remains directly invocable, and invoking it declares the deficit; it is not judged away. During AI-guided activation, loaded safety boundaries, capability restrictions, and explicit user instructions continue to bind.

### Activation heuristics and exceptions

Activate where a mapping is being relied on and what it licenses about a case is open: an abstract framework applied to a concrete case, a structure carried over from an earlier design or a sibling, a possible structural mismatch, or a located abstraction tested against its own members. Prior-session recall indices may seed where to look; they do not settle a constitutive judgment.

A source or target account this session can reach — code, documents, a repository, a published source — is read as evidence inside the audit, whether or not the reader already holds it; the audit never waits for the reader to bring an account first, and never asks them to judge a correspondence. Where what the reader wants is only to come to hold an account, with no mapping being relied on, that is explanation rather than this audit, and the AI-guided path does not activate. Absence of evidence that a mapping is being relied on establishes neither eligibility nor its lack; where the accumulated context does not settle it, say which reading is being used and continue.

Skip AI-guided activation when what the mapping licenses is already settled in context, or no mapping is being relied on. An essence merely sensed across accumulated instances, with no located abstraction yet, is a different deficit; a located abstraction tested against its own members is self-grounding. Framework selection, factual context insufficiency, and whether an already-produced result applies in its actual context remain their own primary deficits.

### Evidence loading

Collect to the limit of your own reach over what the mapping rests on: read code, configuration, documentation, and other available artifacts where either structure is recorded there, and where the source or target structure lives primarily in external APIs, standards, scholarship, or industry material, fetch it and keep its source address visible in the trace. Name the places reached and those that could not be.

Where a claim turns on what an artifact does rather than on what it says about itself, exercise it over the case that separates the readings and cite the result.

## Protocol

### User-facing realization

Before assessing, read back the question — what the comparison is for, the conclusions at stake, and the source and target being audited — citing the person's turn it stands on — whether they set it or took your draft — and the turn or fact that fixed the source and target where R or the context did. Where their words leave any of it open, present the question gate (TOOL GROUNDING `questionGate`) rather than an open question, and collect nothing more until their turn takes or sets the question; what was already collected stays. An instruction to do the next task takes no draft. A source and target that R or a fact fixes are read, not asked. When the question changes, show what was added, removed or reformulated and why; a removed conclusion is outside the revised question, not resolved.

Present the whole assessment in everyday language: the question; for each conclusion, the source relation that carries it, every correspondence it rides on with its fit claim, one concrete scenario, and what actually warrants that claim, the likenesses and the differences in both directions, and what is still unknown; and whether each conclusion holds, is blocked, or is undetermined, with how far it reaches. A source feature the target lacks counts against a conclusion only where that conclusion needs it; under the preservation conclusion, a missing counterpart is reported as missing, and whether an absence was meant is the reader's to say.

Beside each claim that matters, state the scope its grounds were checked within, the target-side fact or observable result that would change it, any materially different explanation its evidence fits as well, and who can reach that evidence or why neither party currently can. Carry out the checks this session can reach before presenting, and name the places collection reached and those it could not; where collected material conflicts, name what conflicts with what. What is still open is shown as the person's own unknown, as the question it is. An unmet check is reported as unmet. A claim with nothing behind it is named as having nothing behind it rather than described as tentative.

For self-grounding, name the level of abstraction at which fit is claimed and allocate every member, rendering a partition only with the grounds supporting that allocation and grouping and with a contrast that makes the fit diagnostic. A split names every rival cell, the fitting core, and all unclustered outliers; a trim distinguishes scattered removal from one-cell reorientation; a hold reports supported fit of all members. Where that basis is unresolved, name what is missing and make no partition recommendation.

Then state what a later turn would change, and proceed without asking for a verdict; next work the person requests follows TOOL GROUNDING `seam`. A later turn is read whole: one that bears on the audit — a changed purpose, conclusion, source or target, a fact, a source, a counterexample, a result from running something — is the context the next pass reads, and a question about this audit the current grounds answer entirely is answered without a new pass; evidence already gathered stays, and verdicts are judged again over the question that now stands. Saying the mapping looks right moves nothing, and saying so is not a failing on the reader's part — it is what this surface is built not to need. Adoption is the reader's own turn taking a conclusion into, or setting it aside from, what they carry over; it opens no pass, and an instruction to do the next task adopts nothing. Adopting and setting aside are recorded as the reader's, kept apart from what the evidence shows, and never given as a reason a verdict came out the way it did; a conclusion adopted over a blocked or undetermined verdict stands as accepted and evidentially disputed, with its grounds shown. While the question waits, a turn that turns to other work is simply answered; the question stays open.

Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when terminology must remain stable, wording must be carried unchanged, material belongs to another round or trace, or composing the question requires placing evidence before its question and option-specific consequences inside the options.

### Intensity

| Level | When | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| Light | One conclusion, one obvious correspondence | Compact rendering of the same required assessment trace |
| Medium | Several conclusions or partial correspondences | Required assessment trace grouped by conclusion and bearing claim |
| Heavy | Complex transfer or structural mismatch | Required assessment trace with expanded presentation of evidence and instantiations |

## Rules

- **Warrant tracks evidence, never assent**: Read each fit claim's warrant off the grounds actually cited for it. Agreement does not promote a claim and disagreement does not defeat one without a ground; what the user reports having observed is evidence like any other observation. Evidence that would fit a materially different explanation as well is read against that explanation too. Record what the reader adopts, report it apart from the evidence, and never offer it as a reason a verdict came out as it did.
- **The question stands on the person's turn**: Read the purpose, the conclusions at stake in the whole scope asked, and the source and target where that choice is open off the person's own words before collecting, constructing, or reassessing. The AI drafts the question with the person but never makes it stand: it does not settle the purpose, narrow the conclusions below what the cited turn asks, or pick between materially different sources or targets without their turn, because this audit closes on evidence and no later utterance of the user's would cover a question the AI made stand. A question the user's words settle is read back; otherwise the question gate (`questionGate`) is presented, and nothing more is collected while it waits. Constitution options remain viable under different user value weightings; shared trajectories collapse, while off-axis responses remain free-response pathways.
- **Collect to the limit of reach**: Collect over what the mapping rests on until nothing reachable is left; name the places reached and those that could not be; show what remains open as the person's own unknown, never as a stall. Where the purpose is to carry a structure over and the person's turn asks nothing narrower, audit whether the whole structure is preserved, with its relations found by collection.
- **Judgment is over conclusions, not correspondences**: Judge each conclusion on its own. A peripheral correspondence may stay open without holding the audit open, and no disposition of correspondences completes it. An undetermined conclusion completes the assessment; a reachable check left unrun does not.
- **Every bearing claim carries its own defeater**: For each fit claim a conclusion turns on, state what target-side fact or observable result, within that claim's own scope, would require it to change, and who can reach that evidence. The builder and the checker being the same process is not the defect; a claim with no stated way to be wrong is. A check nobody ran is reported unmet.
- **Round composition**: Keep each correspondence beside its nearest evidence, scenario, warrant, and next-move implication. Which turn opens a pass is `BearsOnRun`'s reading; the reader is never asked to classify their own turn.
- **Structural evidence**: Cite the specific source and target structures supporting each correspondence, and include a concrete target-domain instantiation. Where a claim turns on an artifact's behavior, exercise the artifact and cite what it did; its own account of that behavior evidences the claim made, not the behavior.
- **Bounded reach**: State the limits supported by the cited grounds and their checked scopes in the same breath as every Licensed verdict. A mapping presented without its breaking point produces confident wrong inference, which is the failure this protocol exists to catch.
- **Self-grounding visibility**: Treat a case as self-grounding only where the source abstraction is located and its member instances are the target. Surface the full member allocation and the grounds supporting it; an unresolved basis carries no partition recommendation. Analogia supplies the partition evidence; what becomes of the cells is the reader's.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request and carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly. Elements fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
