# Babysit a PR

This no-argument invocation explicitly authorizes one durable babysitting goal
for the current repository and PR. A verified execution handoff is sufficient authorization
when execution already confirmed delivery authorization, GitHub
auth, a non-default branch, and this installed plugin; do not ask again or
introduce handoff arguments. Read [the canonical workflow](../../workflows/babysit.md)
completely and follow only its Codex controller branches plus every shared
strict-clearance step. Each tick is one command — the shipped
`hooks/dist/babysit-tick.js` under this plugin's root (`../../hooks/dist/babysit-tick.js`
relative to this file), with `--state-file` set to the Codex slot path; its output contract is [references/helper.md](references/helper.md).
Trust that result: never write a polling script or controller of your own,
never re-fetch with ad-hoc `gh` calls what the result already reports, and act
through `babysit-reply-thread.js`, `babysit-resolve-thread.js` and `babysit-record.js`. Fix items go
through `babysit-route-fix.js --host codex` and, when it dispatches to herdr,
`babysit-dispatch-fix.js start` then `babysit-dispatch-fix.js wait --timeout-seconds 45` — one
bounded wait per continuation. A fixer launch that is due runs first in the
call; it normally takes seconds and is bounded when an agent fails to start.

Use `get_goal` before `create_goal`; keep one active goal for the resolved
repository/PR. Continue with bounded cycles: use the native `wait` mechanism for
at most 60 seconds, persist the exact slot state, and allow later goal
continuations to resume. Pending checks are not completion or blockage.

Call `update_goal` with `complete` only after the same-cycle success audit proves
CI green, zero unresolved threads, and an approved zero-finding bot verdict.
Call it with `blocked` only for a genuine human-only escalation after the same
blocker has met Codex's consecutive-goal-turn threshold. For `stop` or `cancel`,
perform the canonical local cleanup and tell the user to cancel through Codex's
goal control; cancellation is not a completion status.
