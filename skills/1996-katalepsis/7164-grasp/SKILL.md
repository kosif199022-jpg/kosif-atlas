# Katalepsis Protocol

Achieve certain comprehension of a target in play — code, a document, a result — through structured verification, enabling the user to grasp what stands ungrasped. Type: `(TargetUngrasped, User, VERIFY, Target) → VerifiedUnderstanding`.

## Definition

**Katalepsis** (κατάληψις): A dialogical act of achieving firm comprehension—from Stoic philosophy meaning "a grasping firmly"—resolving an ungrasped target into verified user understanding through intent-scented entry points and progressive verification.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written.
Every `axiom` declaration is a judgment that is yours to make from the material in front of
you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this block decides it for you.
Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.
-/

/-! ── FLOW ──
Orient silently → present intent-scented entries and route adequacy → Stop.
Fuse the next utterance → read it once at that context → advance → present the resulting Round.
Task priority and answer handling are defined below, in settle and advance respectively.
A final person's closure → certified task trace → VerifiedUnderstanding.
Withdrawal → the trace so far. Silence → the existing gate holds.

/-! ── MORPHISM ──
Target
  → orient(target, user_signal)        -- infer likely comprehension intents from the target and the user's wording
  → derive_entries(intent)             -- transform inferred intent into high-scent entry points
  → assess_route(intents, entries, context) -- annotate entry-point adequacy before user selection
  → select(intent_entry_point, route_map) -- user chooses the closest intent-scented entry point
  → materialize(artifact_basis)        -- derive concrete artifact anchors for the chosen intent
  → register(tasks)                    -- identify selected tasks by their selection turn and position
  → verify(comprehension)              -- Socratic probing per gap type, each adjudication against an answer attaching the material it was drawn from; a Horizon the answer missed is disclosed with its material and applied; a contradiction in the context is taken up by whose it is
  → confirm(coverage)                  -- aspect coverage check per entry point
  → VerifiedUnderstanding
requires: target_exists(R)              -- the comprehension target is present in context and can be quoted verbatim; its provenance is unconstrained. An admission condition on the target, not a promise that every answer finds enough ground for adjudication
deficit:  TargetUngrasped               -- activation precondition (Layer 1)
preserves: R                            -- read-only throughout; morphism acts on user understanding only
invariant: Comprehension over Explanation
invariant: Completion by the user       -- a task is completed only by the user's Confirm or sufficient; no reading of yours closes one

/-! ── LOOP ──
Recursion consumes only actual utterances. An unanswered gate holds. A round returns a gate,
certified completion, or withdrawal with the trace. Live priority is centralized in `settle`;
an owed cue, disclosure or reasoning question completes the current answer's handling before
returning to that priority. A task's closure respects the person's sufficient/Confirm judgment.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
`VerifiedUnderstanding.closed` requires a nonempty selected roster and a person's closure for
every task. The trace derives from historical readings: accepting an answer, accepting a task,
and demonstrating an aspect remain different. None substitutes for another.

/-! ── TOOL GROUNDING ──
What each operation of this contract does. An interaction with the person is one of two kinds,
and its kind fixes how it continues once its text is presented.
-/

inductive Interaction | constitution | extension

inductive Continuation | stop | proceed

inductive Annot | sense | observe | track | transform | dispatch | interaction (kind : Interaction)

/-- Every interaction presents its text; a Constitution then stops for the person's turn, and an
    Extension proceeds. -/
def Interaction.realization : Interaction → Continuation
  | .constitution => .stop
  | .extension    => .proceed

inductive Op | route | read | assess | record | present | material | converge | seam

def grounding : Op → Annot × String
  | .route => (.observe, "Read target if needed, then routeMap: silent intent-scented orientation and route adequacy")
  | .read => (.observe, "consult: read any source the answer cites, now; then read the whole answer once against that context")
  | .assess => (.sense, "Assess the fused context afresh, under Assessment")
  | .record => (.track, "Context records selections, answers and presentations; said projects their history")
  | .present => (.interaction .constitution, "the Round under present's contract")
  | .material => (.sense, "Quote in place the Measure carried by the adjudication, at the narrowest span")
  | .converge => (.interaction .extension, "show the completed or withdrawn trace under VerifiedUnderstanding")
  | .seam => (.interaction .extension, "Proceed to a next protocol only on a user-declared chain, citing that declaration; this contract declares no wired outbound edge")

## Mode Activation

`/grasp` is user-invoked only: activate when the user signals a wish to understand a target already present in context and available for verbatim quotation, whatever its provenance — AI-produced work, code or a document someone else wrote, or material the session has put on the table; a bare command refers to the current target. Do not activate for an unrelated general question, an accurate account that already demonstrates understanding, an explicit decline, or a trivial formatting-only result.

Loaded safety boundaries, capability restrictions, and explicit user instructions continue to bind while Katalepsis is active.

## Protocol

### Intent-scented entry rendering

Derive up to three first-turn labels from the user's likely comprehension intent — Orientation, Rationale, Impact, Approval, Transfer, or an Emergent intent — and phrase each as what the user will understand, decide, explain, or change by taking that path. Keep Code, Plan, Document, Analysis, Model, or mixed artifact bases behind those labels as grounding anchors. Descriptions state what becomes clear and why it matters; route-map metadata may enrich a label but never reveal a probe answer or reasoning path. A user-authored path remains valid when it stays within `TargetUngrasped → VerifiedUnderstanding`; multiple concerns the user already named become the ordered task list directly.

### Verification rendering and safeguards

Present the selected artifact context and a concrete scenario before each probe. For non-Horizon classificatory probes, render recognizable correct, partial, and misconception trajectories with domain-specific consequences; constitutive probes invite the user's own reasoning, and every probe preserves a free-response path.

Apply `read` and `advance` for answer handling, `settle` for priority, and `present` for the round's obligations. Scope a correction to the part the material actually settles, preserving what the answer already got right.

When grounding an explanation or correction, cite concrete locations in the target — file and line where it is code, the equivalent anchor where it is not. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when terminology must remain stable, wording must be carried unchanged, content belongs to another round or trace, or phase order determines whether text belongs before or inside a gate.

### Intensity

| Level | Realization |
|-------|-------------|
| Light | One Constitution probe of core understanding |
| Medium | One scenario probe of prediction or impact |
| Heavy | Decomposed probes of causal or sequential understanding |

## Rules

- **User-initiated only**: Activate only on the user's wish to understand a target present in context and quotable, whatever produced it; an explicit decline before activation withholds it; a withdrawal during a run ends it with what was shown on record, and leaving without saying so is the host's to deliver.
- **Intent scent before artifact taxonomy**: First user-facing options name the user's likely comprehension outcome; artifact categories remain grounding material.
- **User authority**: The user's account of what they understand stands for the ground it covers. Do not probe that ground again.
- **Round composition**: Compose each round so the reader can act without reassembly — use everyday language, keep each judgment beside its evidence and next-move implication (your own adjudication included, its evidence being the excerpt attached with it), and place analytical context before its gate.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request; carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
- **Contract execution**: Read each utterance under `read`; apply `advance`, with task priority from `settle`. Present the entire `Round` under `present`, and the terminal trace under `VerifiedUnderstanding`. These definitions carry the intent correction, ownership, grounding, closure, and continuation obligations.
- **Horizon calibration**: Demote or revise the instrumentation after repeated applicable opportunities if detections remain absent, speculative, or unhelpful.
