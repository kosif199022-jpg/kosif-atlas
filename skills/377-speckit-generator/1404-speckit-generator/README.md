# SpecKit Generator

Project-focused specification and task management system for Claude Code with git checkpoint safety, mandatory approval gates, implementation hooks, and specialized analysis agents.

## Overview

SpecKit Generator transforms specifications into executed implementations through a structured workflow. The plugin provides one bootstrap command (`/speckit.init`) that installs 8 project-local commands. Each command produces artifacts that require user review before proceeding, ensuring quality and alignment at every step.

```
/speckit.init → /plan → /tasks → /design → /implement
                   ↑        ↑        ↑          ↓
               /analyze  /clarify /analyze   /revert
                                     ↓
                                  /lint
```

### Key Architecture

- **Bootstrap Command**: `/speckit.init` is the only plugin-level command
- **Project Commands**: 8 commands installed to `.claude/commands/` for project use (plan, tasks, design, analyze, clarify, implement, revert, lint)
- **Analysis Agents**: 6 specialized agents for deep analysis (reducing context pollution)
- **Anti-Pattern Detection**: 50 patterns across 5 tech stacks with severity levels and remediation

### Key Features

- **Git Checkpoint Safety**: Automatic checkpoints before implementation enable safe rollback
- **Memory-Driven Compliance**: Constitution and tech-specific memory files guide all execution
- **Mandatory Gates**: Each command requires explicit user approval before proceeding
- **Intelligent Failure Analysis**: Revert command analyzes failures and recommends fixes
- **Idempotent Operations**: All commands safe to run repeatedly
- **Execution Orchestration**: Deviation rules, checkpoint taxonomy, and authentication gates
- **4-Level Verification**: Exists → Substantive → Wired → Functional (spans two agents)
- **Session Continuity**: Resume sessions with preserved context and progress metrics

## Installation

### As a Claude Code Plugin

1. Clone or copy this directory to your Claude Code plugins location
2. Enable the plugin in Claude Code settings
3. Commands will be available as `/speckit.*`

### As a Skill

The skill is automatically available when the skill files are in the skills directory.

## Commands

### Plugin Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/speckit.init` | Establish .claude/ foundation with git, install project commands | New projects or incomplete setup |

### Project Commands (Installed by /speckit.init)

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Create plans from specifications | After specs exist in speckit/ |
| `/tasks` | Generate tasks from plans | After plans are approved |
| `/design` | Generate detailed task designs | Before implementing complex tasks |
| `/analyze` | Audit project consistency | Anytime for health check |
| `/clarify` | SEAMS-enhanced ambiguity resolution | When specs have open questions |
| `/implement` | Execute tasks with git checkpoint | When ready to implement |
| `/revert` | Revert to checkpoint with analysis | When implementation fails |
| `/lint` | Scan code for anti-patterns | Before code review or after implementation |

## Analysis Agents

SpecKit includes 6 specialized agents that handle deep analysis tasks, keeping the main conversation context clean.

| Agent | Purpose | Used By |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `compliance-checker` | Validate code against directive rules (constitution, tech-specific) | /analyze, /implement |
| `ambiguity-scanner` | SEAMS-based detection across 13 categories | /clarify |
| `coverage-mapper` | Map requirements → phases → tasks, identify gaps | /analyze, /tasks, /implement |
| `smart-validator` | Validate acceptance criteria against SMART framework | /tasks |
| `adr-validator` | Validate ADRs have required fields for their level | /plan |
| `antipattern-detector` | Scan code for anti-patterns across 5 tech stacks | /lint, code review |

### Invoking Agents

Agents are invoked via the Task tool:

```
subagent_type: "speckit-generator:compliance-checker"
prompt: "Check compliance of src/auth/*.ts against constitution.md"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
/speckit.init
```

This will:
- Validate git is available (required for checkpoints)
- Detect your tech stack
- Create the `.claude/` directory structure
- Install all 8 project commands (plan, tasks, design, analyze, clarify, implement, revert, lint)
- Install appropriate memory files
- Set up `.gitignore` for speckit

### 2. Add Your Specification

Place your specification document in `speckit/`:

```
speckit/spec.md
```

### 3. Generate a Plan

```bash
/plan
```

Review the generated plan and approve before proceeding.

### 4. Generate Tasks

```bash
/tasks
```

Review the generated tasks with their acceptance criteria.

### 5. Design Complex Tasks (Optional)

```bash
/design "Task-001"
```

For complex tasks, generate detailed designs before implementing.

### 6. Implement

```bash
/implement "Phase 1"
```

This will:
- Create a git checkpoint (revertable)
- Execute tasks in the specified phase
- Update task statuses with verification evidence
- Update project-status.md with progress

### 7. If Something Goes Wrong

```bash
/revert
```

This will:
- Revert to the last checkpoint
- Analyze what went wrong
- Recommend spec/plan/task updates

## Directory Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```

```

## Memory Files

SpecKit uses memory files to provide consistent guidelines across all commands.

### Universal (Always Included)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `constitution.md` | Core principles and mandatory constraints |
| `documentation.md` | Documentation standards |
| `git-cicd.md` | Git workflow and CI/CD practices |
| `security.md` | Security requirements |
| `testing.md` | Testing strategies |

### Tech-Specific (Auto-Detected)

| File | Detected By |
|------|-------------|
| `typescript.md` | tsconfig.json, .ts files |
| `react-nextjs.md` | next.config.js, React imports |
| `tailwind-shadcn.md` | tailwind.config.js |
| `python.md` | setup.py, pyproject.toml, .py files |
| `rust.md` | Cargo.toml, .rs files |

## Anti-Pattern Detection

SpecKit includes comprehensive anti-pattern detection across 5 tech stacks with 50 patterns total.

### Pattern Categories

| Tech Stack | Patterns | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| TypeScript | AP-TS-01 to AP-TS-10 | `any` abuse, type assertion, stringly-typed |
| Python | AP-PY-01 to AP-PY-10 | Mutable defaults, bare except, wildcard imports |
| Rust | AP-RS-01 to AP-RS-10 | `.unwrap()` in library, blocking in async |
| React/Next.js | AP-RN-01 to AP-RN-10 | Missing deps, prop drilling, index as key |
| Tailwind/shadcn | AP-TW-01 to AP-TW-10 | Hardcoded colors, missing dark mode |

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability | Block merge |
| HIGH | Significant bug risk | Require fix |
| MEDIUM | Code smell | Recommend fix |
| LOW | Style issue | Suggest fix |

### Using /lint

```bash
# Scan all code
/lint

# Scan specific path with HIGH+ severity
/lint src/ --severity=HIGH

# Get detailed remediation guidance
/lint src/api/ --fix
```

### Memory File Integration

Each tech-specific memory file includes a compact anti-patterns section (~10-15 lines per pattern). Dedicated files in `assets/memory/antipatterns/` provide:

- Detection patterns (regex/AST)
- Detailed remediation steps
- When exceptions are acceptable
- Tool configuration (ESLint, Clippy, Ruff)

## Git Checkpoint System

### How It Works

1. **Before `/implement`**: A checkpoint tag is created
   ```
   speckit-checkpoint-20240115_143500
   ```

2. **During implementation**: Normal git operations continue

3. **If something goes wrong**: Use `/revert` to return to checkpoint

### Checkpoint Commands

```bash
# List all checkpoints
/revert --list

# Revert to most recent
/revert

# Revert to specific checkpoint
/revert speckit-checkpoint-20240115_143500

# Preview without reverting
/revert --dry-run
```

## Hooks

SpecKit enforces workflow integrity through hooks.

### Pre-Implementation Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Load project-status.md | Understand current state |
| Validate argument | Show status if missing/invalid |
| Verify tasks actionable | Filter completed, check dependencies |
| Present execution plan | Get user confirmation |
| Create git checkpoint | Enable safe rollback |

### Post-Implementation Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Update tasks.md | Status and acceptance criteria with evidence |
| Update project-status.md | Progress metrics and activity log |
| Output summary | Completed tasks, next steps, revert option |

## Failure Analysis

When you revert, SpecKit analyzes what went wrong:

| Category | Indicators | Recommendation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| SPEC_GAP | Requirements unclear | `/speckit.clarify` |
| APPROACH_WRONG | Architecture mismatch | `/speckit.plan --revise` |
| DEPENDENCY_ISSUE | External problems | Update dependencies |
| TEST_MISMATCH | Tests don't match | Update test fixtures |
| SCOPE_CREEP | Too much at once | Decompose tasks |
| KNOWLEDGE_GAP | Unfamiliar technology | Research first |

## Plan Command (PLANS-Enhanced)

The `/plan` command uses the PLANS taxonomy for systematic implementation planning with ADR-style architecture decisions. It invokes the **adr-validator** agent to ensure ADR completeness.

### PLANS Taxonomy

| Category | Focus | Detection Target |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **P**hases | Implementation phases, milestones | Missing phases, unclear objectives |
| **L**inkages | Inter-phase dependencies | Circular deps, undefined prerequisites |
| **A**rchitecture | ADR-based decisions | Undocumented choices, missing rationale |
| **N**otes | Task generation guidance | Vague notes, unclear scope indicators |
| **S**cope | Requirement coverage mapping | Orphan requirements, coverage gaps |

### ADR Template Levels

| Level | When to Use | Required Fields |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lightweight | Simple decisions, single-option obvious | Status, Context, Decision, Consequences |
| Standard | Multiple valid options | All except Confirmation |
| Full | Critical/security decisions | All fields |

### 7-Point Validation

1. Requirements mapping complete
2. Coverage status documented per PLANS category
3. ADRs have all required fields for their level
4. Phase sequencing valid (no circular deps)
5. Traceability established (REQ → Phase → ADR)
6. Task generation notes present for each phase
7. Markdown structure valid

## Tasks Command (SMART-Enhanced)

The `/tasks` command uses SMART validation for verifiable acceptance criteria. It invokes **coverage-mapper** and **smart-validator** agents for thorough validation.

### SMART Acceptance Criteria

| Element | Requirement | Fail Condition |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **S**pecific | Clear, concrete action | "properly", "correctly", "fully" |
| **M**easurable | Objective verification | No command/metric/file check |
| **A**chievable | Single task scope | Requires other tasks first |
| **R**elevant | Ties to task purpose | No trace to plan/requirement |
| **T**ime-bound | Immediate verification | Requires external delays |

### Criterion Format

```markdown
- [ ] File `src/lib/auth.ts` exports `authenticate` function
      Verification: `grep -q "export.*authenticate" src/lib/auth.ts`
      SMART: S✓ M✓ A✓ R✓ T✓
```

### SMART Strictness Levels

| Level | Behavior | When to Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Strict | Block until criterion rewritten | Critical tasks, security-related |
| Standard | Flag for review, allow with warning | Default for most tasks |
| Relaxed | Log finding only | Exploratory/research tasks |

### 8-Point Validation

1. SMART criteria validated for all acceptance criteria
2. Plan traceability established (TASK → PHASE → ADR)
3. Constitution references valid
4. Memory file references valid
5. No circular dependencies
6. Status-criteria consistency (COMPLETED ⟹ all [x])
7. ID uniqueness verified
8. Phase grouping correct

## Clarify Command (SEAMS-Enhanced)

The `/clarify` command uses the SEAMS framework (Structure, Execution, Assumptions, Mismatches, Stakeholders) for systematic ambiguity detection. It invokes the **ambiguity-scanner** agent to identify and prioritize specification gaps.

### Key Features

- **Sequential Questioning**: One question at a time, never reveals the queue
- **Table-Based Options**: Multiple choice with prominent recommendations
- **Atomic Saves**: Spec updated immediately after each answer
- **Impact × Uncertainty Prioritization**: Questions ranked by `Priority = Impact × Uncertainty`
- **Four-Status Coverage**: Resolved (✓), Clear (○), Deferred (◐), Outstanding (⚠)
- **Post-Write Validation**: 6-point checklist after each integration

### 13-Category Taxonomy

| Category | Group | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| SCOPE | Functional | Feature boundaries, in/out scope |
| BEHAVIOR | Functional | User actions, state transitions |
| SEQUENCE | Functional | Order of operations |
| AUTHORITY | Functional | Decision makers, permissions |
| DATA | Data/Integration | Entities, formats, validation |
| INTERFACE | Data/Integration | API contracts, protocols |
| CONSTRAINT | Data/Integration | Limits, bounds |
| TEMPORAL | Data/Integration | Timing, duration |
| ERROR | Quality/Ops | Error handling, failure modes |
| RECOVERY | Quality/Ops | Degradation, retry, fallback |
| ASSUMPTION | Quality/Ops | Implicit beliefs |
| STAKEHOLDER | Quality/Ops | Operator, security, user views |
| TRACEABILITY | Quality/Ops | Requirements ↔ design coverage |

### Session Constraints

- **5 questions max** per interactive session
- **10 questions max** total across all sessions for a spec
- **Answer format**: Option letter OR ≤5 words

### Autonomous Mode (Ralph Loop)

If the `ralph-loop` plugin is installed, `/clarify --ralph` enables autonomous clarification until all CRITICAL/HIGH ambiguities are resolved.

## Workflow Best Practices

### Do

- Run `/analyze` before approving plans
- Run `/clarify` when specs have [TBD] items
- Review each command's output before proceeding
- Use git commits between major phases
- Check project-status.md for current state

### Don't

- Chain commands without reviewing output
- Skip the analyze step before implementation
- Ignore failed acceptance criteria
- Force push after checkpoint (breaks revert)
- Delete checkpoint tags manually

## Configuration

### Plugin Configuration

The plugin is configured via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "speckit-generator",
  "version": "1.5.0",
  "hooks": "../hooks/hooks.json",
  "commands": [...]
}
```

### Project Configuration

Project-specific settings are in `.claude/memory/`:

- `constitution.md` - Customize core principles
- Tech-specific files - Adjust guidelines per technology

## Troubleshooting

### "Git not found"

Install git before running `/speckit.init`:
```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git

# Windows
# Download from https://git-scm.com/
```

### "No checkpoints found"

Checkpoints are created by `/speckit.implement`. If none exist:
1. You haven't run implement yet, or
2. Checkpoint tags were deleted

### "Project not initialized"

Run `/speckit.init` first to create the `.claude/` structure.

### Tasks not updating

Ensure you're running the full implement workflow. Post-implementation hooks only run when the command completes normally.
