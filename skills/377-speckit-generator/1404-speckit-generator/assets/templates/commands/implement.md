================================================================================
INIT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
When copying this template to the user's project, you MUST customize the
"Ralph Loop Mode" section based on whether the ralph-loop plugin is detected.

CHECK for ralph-loop:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json | grep -q "ralph-loop"
```

IF ralph-loop IS detected:
- Include the full "Ralph Loop Mode (Autonomous Execution)" section
- Set Status to "✓ Enabled (ralph-loop plugin detected)"
- Include usage examples and exit criteria

IF ralph-loop is NOT detected:
- Include a disabled notice with installation instructions
- Set Status to "✗ Disabled (ralph-loop plugin not installed)"

REMOVE these instruction comments from the final output.
================================================================================
-->

# Implement

Execute tasks from `speckit/*-tasks.md` with batch execution, gates, and mandatory hooks.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Usage

```
/implement TASK-001           # Single task
/implement TASK-001..TASK-005 # Range
/implement "Phase 1"          # All in phase
/implement @foundation        # All with group
/implement --continue         # Resume from last
/implement                    # No argument - triggers status check
```

---

## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Hooks

**CRITICAL**: These hooks MUST execute BEFORE any task implementation begins.

### Pre-Hook 1: Load Project Status

**ALWAYS** read `.claude/memory/project-status.md` first to understand:
- Current phase and progress
- What was completed in previous sessions
- Any blockers or failed criteria from last run
- Recommended next actions

```
Read: .claude/memory/project-status.md

Extract:
- Current Phase: [phase name]
- Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks ([Z]%)
- Last Activity: [date] - [what was done]
- Pending Actions: [list]
```

### Pre-Hook 2: Validate Argument / Show Status

**IF no argument provided OR invalid argument:**

```markdown
## Current Project Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Project | [PROJECT_NAME] |
| Current Phase | Phase [N]: [Name] |
| Progress | [X]/[Y] tasks ([Z]%) |
| Last Updated | [DATE] |

### Phase Progress
| Phase | Status | Completed/Total |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | ✓ COMPLETE | 6/6 |
| Phase 2 | IN PROGRESS | 3/8 |
| Phase 3 | PENDING | 0/5 |

### Recommended Next Action

Based on current state, you should run:

```
/implement "Phase 2"
```

Or to continue from where you left off:

```
/implement --continue
```

### Available Selectors

| Selector | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| `TASK-XXX` | Execute single task |
| `TASK-XXX..TASK-YYY` | Execute range |
| `"Phase N"` | Execute all in phase |
| `@group` | Execute all with group tag |
| `--continue` | Resume from last position |
| `--all` | Execute all pending tasks |

**Please specify which tasks to implement.**
```

**STOP HERE** - Do not proceed without valid task selection.

### Pre-Hook 3: Validate Task Selection

For valid arguments, verify:

1. **Tasks exist** - Check *-tasks.md contains specified tasks
2. **Tasks are actionable** - Filter out COMPLETED tasks
3. **Dependencies met** - Check BLOCKED status

**IF no actionable tasks found:**

```markdown
## No Actionable Tasks

The specified selection has no pending tasks:

- `TASK-001`: COMPLETED (2024-01-15)
- `TASK-002`: COMPLETED (2024-01-15)
- `TASK-003`: COMPLETED (2024-01-15)

### Suggestions

1. **Move to next phase:**
   ```
   /implement "Phase [N+1]"
   ```

2. **Re-run a completed task:**
   ```
   /implement TASK-XXX --force
   ```

3. **Check overall status:**
   ```
   cat .claude/memory/project-status.md
   ```
```

### Pre-Hook 4: Check Design Files

For each task, check if a design file exists:

```
Check: speckit/designs/design-[TASK-ID].md
```

**IF design file exists:**
- Load design and use as implementation guide
- Follow data models, method signatures, and test cases from design
- Verify implementation matches design specifications

**IF design file does NOT exist:**
- Note task lacks detailed design
- For complex tasks (Scope: L or M), suggest:
  ```
  Consider running `/design [TASK-ID]` first for detailed implementation guidance.
  ```
- For simple tasks (Scope: S), proceed without design

### Pre-Hook 5: Present Execution Plan

Before executing, present the plan:

```markdown
## Execution Plan

**Selection**: [what user specified]
**Tasks to execute**: [count]

| Task | Title | Status | Dependencies | Design |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|--------|
| TASK-004 | [Title] | PENDING | None | ✓ Available |
| TASK-005 | [Title] | PENDING | TASK-004 | ✗ None |
| TASK-006 | [Title] | FAILED | None (retry) | ✓ Available |

**Context to load**:
- Constitution: §3.1, §4.2, §5.1
- Memory: typescript.md, testing.md
- Designs: design-TASK-004.md, design-TASK-006.md

**Proceed with execution?**
```

---

## Deviation Rules

When unexpected work arises during implementation, follow these rules to decide whether to proceed autonomously or ask for approval.

### The 4 Deviation Rules

| Rule | Trigger | Action | Permission |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Rule 1** | Bug discovered during implementation | Auto-fix immediately | No permission needed |
| **Rule 2** | Missing critical functionality blocking task | Auto-add the minimum needed | No permission needed |
| **Rule 3** | Blocking issue (test failure, lint error) | Auto-fix to unblock | No permission needed |
| **Rule 4** | Architectural change required | **ASK** before proceeding | Requires approval |

### Rule Priority

**Rule 4 trumps Rules 1-3.** If a bug fix or blocking issue would require architectural changes, ask first.

### What Counts as Architectural?

| Architectural (Rule 4 - ASK) | Not Architectural (Rules 1-3 - AUTO) |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| New dependency added | Import reorganization |
| Database schema change | Query optimization |
| API contract change | Internal refactoring |
| New service/component | Bug fix in existing code |
| Authentication flow change | Missing null check |
| State management restructure | Type annotation fix |

### Deviation Documentation

**Every deviation MUST be documented.** After applying Rules 1-3 or receiving approval for Rule 4, add an entry:

```markdown
### Deviation Log

| Rule | Finding | Fix | Files | Verification |
|------|---------|-----|-------|--------------|
| R1 | Null pointer in user lookup | Added null check | src/user.ts:45 | Tests pass |
| R2 | Missing validation for email | Added email validator | src/validate.ts | `npm test` ✓ |
| R3 | Lint error blocking build | Fixed unused import | src/api.ts:12 | `npm run lint` ✓ |
| R4 | Needed Redis for caching | Added Redis dependency | package.json, src/cache.ts | User approved |
```

### Deviation Summary Format

At end of implementation session, include deviation summary:

```markdown
## Deviations This Session

**Total**: [N] deviations
- Rule 1 (bugs): [count]
- Rule 2 (missing): [count]
- Rule 3 (blocking): [count]
- Rule 4 (architectural): [count]

[If any Rule 4:]
### Architectural Changes Made (Approved)
- [Description of change and approval context]
```

---

## Workflow (After Pre-Hooks Pass)

### Phase 1: Execute Tasks

For each task:

1. **Load context**:
   - Extract referenced constitution sections (§X.Y)
   - Load relevant memory file sections
   - Load design file if available (`speckit/designs/design-[TASK-ID].md`)
   - Present context before execution

2. **Execute** the task implementation:
   - If design exists: Follow data models, method signatures, and algorithm from design
   - If no design: Implement based on task description and acceptance criteria
   - Run test cases from design (if provided)

3. **Update status**: PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED

### Checkpoint Taxonomy

Use checkpoints to pause execution for human involvement. **Core principle: If Claude CAN automate it, Claude MUST automate it.**

#### Checkpoint Types

| Type | Frequency | Purpose | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `checkpoint:human-verify` | ~90% | Claude automates, human confirms result | "Verify the UI looks correct" |
| `checkpoint:decision` | ~9% | Human makes a choice that affects next steps | "Choose between approach A or B" |
| `checkpoint:human-action` | ~1% | Truly unavoidable manual step | "Enter 2FA code", "Sign document" |

#### When to Use Each Type

**checkpoint:human-verify** (Most Common)
- Visual confirmation (UI looks right, layout correct)
- Functional testing (click through, test workflow)
- External service verification (email received, webhook fired)

**checkpoint:decision**
- Architecture choices not in plan
- Feature scope decisions
- Priority conflicts between tasks

**checkpoint:human-action** (Rare - Avoid If Possible)
- Physical actions (hardware, signing)
- Authentication requiring human presence (biometrics, 2FA)
- Legal/compliance approvals

#### Checkpoint Display Formats

```markdown
## ⏸️ checkpoint:human-verify

**Task**: TASK-005 - User Profile Page
**What Claude Did**: Implemented profile page with avatar, bio, and settings

### Please Verify
- [ ] Profile page renders correctly at `/profile`
- [ ] Avatar upload works
- [ ] Bio text saves properly

Say "verified" or "looks good" to continue, or describe issues.
```

```markdown
## 🤔 checkpoint:decision

**Task**: TASK-007 - Caching Strategy
**Context**: Plan didn't specify caching approach

### Options
| Option | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| A. Redis | More setup, better for distributed |
| B. In-memory | Simple, single-instance only |
| C. None | Skip caching for now |

Which approach? (A/B/C)
```

```markdown
## 🔐 checkpoint:human-action

**Task**: TASK-012 - Deploy to Production
**Reason**: Requires 2FA approval in deployment dashboard

### Required Action
1. Go to https://deploy.example.com/approve
2. Enter your 2FA code
3. Click "Approve Deployment"

Say "done" when complete.
```

---

### Phase 2: Gate at Boundaries

At phase/group completion:

```
Phase [N] complete.
Tasks completed: [count]
Tasks failed: [count]

Options:
1. Continue to Phase [N+1]
2. Review completed work
3. Re-run failed tasks
4. Stop execution
```

---

## MANDATORY: Post-Implementation Hooks

**CRITICAL**: These hooks MUST execute after ANY implementation run. The command is NOT complete without them.

### Post-Hook 0: Compliance Check (Agent)

After implementing code, verify compliance with project directives.

**Invoke compliance-checker agent:**
```
subagent_type: "speckit-generator:compliance-checker"
prompt: "Check compliance of [MODIFIED_FILES] against .claude/memory/constitution.md and relevant tech-specific memory files"
```

The agent validates:
- MUST/MUST NOT rules from constitution
- Technology-specific requirements
- Security requirements

**Handle results:**
- CRITICAL: Must fix before marking task complete
- HIGH: Should fix, warn if proceeding
- MEDIUM/LOW: Document for later review

### Post-Hook 1: Update tasks.md

For EACH task worked on:

```markdown
### TASK-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completed**: [ISO_TIMESTAMP]
**Verified By**: Claude

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Criterion 1 - Verified: [evidence/command output]
- [x] Criterion 2 - Verified: [evidence/command output]
- [ ] Criterion 3 - FAILED: [specific reason]
```

**Verification Methods**:

| Criterion Type | Verification |
|----------------|--------------|
| File exists | `ls [path]` or glob |
| Tests pass | Run test command |
| Code compiles | Run build |
| Lint clean | Run linter |
| Type checks | Run type checker |

### Post-Hook 2: Update project-status.md

Location: `.claude/memory/project-status.md`

Update with:
- Current phase and progress metrics
- Phase completion status table
- Recent activity log entry
- Updated next actions

### Post-Hook 3: Output Completion Summary

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

### Tasks Completed This Session
| Task ID | Title | Status | Criteria |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| TASK-XXX | [Title] | ✓ COMPLETED | 3/3 ✓ |
| TASK-XXX | [Title] | ⚠ PARTIAL | 2/3 |

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
**Total**: [N] | **Passed**: [M] ([%]) | **Failed**: [F]

[If failed:]
#### Failed Criteria
| Task | Criterion | Reason |
|------|-----------|--------|
| TASK-XXX | [Criterion] | [Reason] |

### Project Status Updated
- Phase: [N] [status]
- Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks ([Z]%)
- project-status.md: Updated ✓

### Next Steps
1. [Based on current state]
2. [Specific command to run]
```

## Authentication Gates

When a CLI command returns an authentication error, treat it as a **gate** (not a failure) and handle it dynamically.

### Auth Error Detection Patterns

| Pattern | Tool/Service | Example Error |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | REST APIs | HTTP status code |
| `403 Forbidden` | Cloud APIs | Permission denied |
| `not logged in` | CLI tools | `gh: not logged in` |
| `authentication required` | Git/SSH | `git push` failures |
| `token expired` | OAuth/JWT | Session timeout |
| `EACCES` | File/Cloud | Permission errors |
| `credentials not found` | AWS/GCP/Azure | Missing config |

### Dynamic Checkpoint Creation

When auth error detected:

```markdown
## 🔐 Authentication Gate

**Task**: [CURRENT_TASK]
**Command**: `[FAILED_COMMAND]`
**Error**: [AUTH_ERROR_MESSAGE]

### What Happened
A command requires authentication that Claude cannot perform autonomously.

### Required Action
1. Run the following command manually:
   ```
   [AUTH_COMMAND]
   ```
2. Complete the authentication flow
3. Say "done" or "authenticated" to continue

### After Authentication
Claude will:
1. Verify auth works: `[VERIFY_COMMAND]`
2. Retry original command
3. Continue with task execution
```

### Auth Commands by Service

| Service | Auth Command | Verify Command |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| GitHub CLI | `gh auth login` | `gh auth status` |
| AWS CLI | `aws configure` | `aws sts get-caller-identity` |
| GCP | `gcloud auth login` | `gcloud auth list` |
| Azure | `az login` | `az account show` |
| npm | `npm login` | `npm whoami` |
| Docker | `docker login` | `docker info` |
| Vercel | `vercel login` | `vercel whoami` |

### Retry Protocol

After user confirms authentication:

1. **Verify** - Run verify command to confirm auth works
2. **Log** - Record auth gate in Recent Activity
3. **Retry** - Re-run the original failed command
4. **Continue** - Resume task execution from where it stopped

### Auth Gate Behavior

- Auth gates do NOT count as task failures
- Auth gates are logged but do not reset task progress
- Multiple auth gates in one session are normal (different services)
- Auth gates pause execution but preserve all context

### Concrete Example: GitHub CLI Auth Gate

**Scenario**: Task requires creating a PR, but `gh` is not authenticated.

**CLI Output** (triggers auth gate detection):
```
$ gh pr create --title "Add user auth" --body "..."
error: gh: not logged in. Run `gh auth login` to authenticate.
```

**Auth Gate Presented**:
```markdown
## 🔐 Authentication Gate

**Task**: TASK-012 - Create Pull Request
**Command**: `gh pr create --title "Add user auth" --body "..."`
**Error**: gh: not logged in

### What Happened
The GitHub CLI requires authentication to create pull requests.

### Required Action
1. Run the following command manually:
   ```
   gh auth login
   ```
2. Select your preferred authentication method (browser, token, etc.)
3. Say "done" or "authenticated" to continue

### After Authentication
Claude will:
1. Verify auth works: `gh auth status`
2. Retry original command: `gh pr create ...`
3. Continue with task execution
```

**After User Says "done"**:
```
$ gh auth status
github.com
  ✓ Logged in to github.com as username (oauth_token)
  ✓ Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.

Auth verified. Retrying original command...

$ gh pr create --title "Add user auth" --body "..."
https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42

✓ PR created successfully. Continuing task execution...
```

## Ralph Loop Mode (Autonomous Execution)

<!-- INIT: Customize this section based on ralph-loop plugin detection -->

<!-- INIT: IF ralph-loop IS detected, use this content: -->
**Status**: ✓ Enabled (ralph-loop plugin detected)

Use `--ralph` flag for autonomous implementation that iterates until all acceptance criteria are verified:

```
/implement "Phase 1" --ralph
/implement TASK-001..TASK-010 --ralph --max-iterations 30
```

### How It Works

1. Wraps implementation in a ralph-loop with `/ralph-loop`
2. Completion promise: `<promise>ALL_CRITERIA_VERIFIED</promise>`
3. Iterates until ALL acceptance criteria for selected tasks are `[x]` checked
4. Safety limit: 50 iterations (override with `--max-iterations`)

### Exit Criteria

The loop exits ONLY when:
- Every selected task has status: COMPLETED
- Every acceptance criterion is marked `[x]` with verification evidence
- No criteria remain `[ ]` or FAILED

### Ralph Loop Prompt Construction

When `--ralph` is specified, construct the ralph-loop call:

```
/ralph-loop "Execute the following implementation tasks and verify ALL acceptance criteria.

Tasks: [TASK_SELECTION]

For each task:
1. Read task details from tasks.md
2. Implement the task
3. Verify EACH acceptance criterion with evidence
4. Mark criterion [x] with verification notes
5. Update task status to COMPLETED

Exit criteria: ALL acceptance criteria must be [x] verified.

When ALL criteria are verified, output: <promise>ALL_CRITERIA_VERIFIED</promise>

If stuck after multiple attempts, document blockers but do NOT output the promise until genuinely complete." --completion-promise "ALL_CRITERIA_VERIFIED" --max-iterations [N]
```

<!-- INIT: IF ralph-loop is NOT detected, use this content instead:
**Status**: ✗ Disabled (ralph-loop plugin not installed)

To enable autonomous implementation mode, install the ralph-loop plugin:
```
/install-plugin ralph-loop
```

Then re-run `/speckit.init` to update this command.
-->

<!-- INIT: Remove all HTML comments from final output -->

## Subagent Segmentation

Route plan segments to optimal execution contexts for better context management and parallel execution.

### Segmentation Rules

| Checkpoint Pattern | Routing | Rationale |
|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| No checkpoints | Single subagent | Fresh 200k context, uninterrupted |
| Verify-only checkpoints | Multiple subagents + orchestrator | Can run in parallel, orchestrator coordinates |
| Decision checkpoints | Main context | Decision affects subsequent tasks |
| Mixed | Hybrid | Segment at decision points |

### Segment Analysis

Before execution, analyze the task list:

```markdown
## Segment Analysis

**Tasks**: TASK-001 through TASK-010
**Checkpoints found**: 3

### Segments

| Segment | Tasks | Checkpoints | Routing |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Seg-1 | TASK-001..003 | verify | → Subagent A |
| Seg-2 | TASK-004..005 | decision | → Main (wait for input) |
| Seg-3 | TASK-006..010 | verify, verify | → Subagent B |

### Execution Order

1. Launch Subagent A for Seg-1
2. Wait for Seg-1 verify checkpoint
3. Execute Seg-2 in main context (decision needed)
4. After decision, launch Subagent B for Seg-3
```

### Subagent Launch Format

```markdown
Launching segment execution...

**Segment**: Seg-1 (TASK-001..003)
**Agent ID**: [AGENT_ID]
**Context**: Fresh 200k tokens
**Checkpoints**: 1 (verify at end)

Running in background. Will report at checkpoint.
```

### Agent Tracking

Track launched agents for coordination and resume:

```markdown
### Active Agents

| Agent ID | Segment | Tasks | Status | Last Update |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| agent-a1b2 | Seg-1 | TASK-001..003 | Running | [TIME] |
| agent-c3d4 | Seg-3 | TASK-006..010 | Pending | — |

### Completed Agents

| Agent ID | Segment | Tasks | Duration | Result |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| agent-x1y2 | Seg-0 | TASK-000 | 5m | ✓ All criteria passed |
```

### When to Use Segmentation

| Scenario | Use Segmentation? | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 3+ tasks, no decisions | Yes | Fresh context improves quality |
| Tasks with shared state | No | State must persist in main |
| Long-running phase | Yes | Prevents context exhaustion |
| Quick fixes (1-2 tasks) | No | Overhead not worth it |
| Debugging session | No | Need full context history |

### Segment Handoff Protocol

When a subagent completes:

1. **Report** - Subagent outputs completion summary
2. **Verify** - Main context verifies checkpoint criteria
3. **Integrate** - Update project-status.md with results
4. **Continue** - Launch next segment or proceed in main
