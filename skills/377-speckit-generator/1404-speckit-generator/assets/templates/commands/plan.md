# Plan

PLANS-enhanced implementation planning with ADR-style architecture decisions and requirement coverage mapping.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

---

## Usage

```
/plan                   # Plan from all specs
/plan spec.md           # Plan from specific spec
/plan --all             # Force regenerate all plans
/plan --status          # Show coverage without generating
```

---

## Memory Directives

<!-- INIT: Replace this section with the actual directive files for this project -->

Load these directive files for architecture decision guidance:

**Always loaded:**
- `constitution.md` - Global principles, quality gates
- `security.md` - Security requirements for ADRs
- `documentation.md` - Documentation standards

**Project-specific:**
<!-- INIT: List only the tech-specific files detected for this project -->
- `[DETECTED_TECH_FILE].md` - [Description]

<!-- INIT: Remove all HTML comments from final output -->

---

## PLANS Taxonomy (5 Categories)

Systematic coverage scan for implementation planning:

| Category | Focus | Detection Target |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **P**hases | Implementation phases, milestones | Missing phases, unclear objectives |
| **L**inkages | Inter-phase dependencies | Circular deps, undefined prerequisites |
| **A**rchitecture | ADR-based decisions | Undocumented choices, missing rationale |
| **N**otes | Task generation guidance | Vague notes, unclear scope indicators |
| **S**cope | Requirement coverage mapping | Orphan requirements, coverage gaps |

### PLANS Activation by Project Type

<!-- INIT: Enable recommended categories based on project type -->

| Project Type | Heavy Categories | Rationale |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Greenfield | ARCHITECTURE | New decisions needed |
| Migration | LINKAGES | Dependencies critical |
| Refactoring | ARCHITECTURE, NOTES | Preserve + improve |
| Feature Addition | SCOPE, NOTES | Fit into existing |

**Active for this project:**
<!-- INIT: Set based on detected project type -->
- [x] **Phases**: Implementation phases, milestones
- [x] **Linkages**: Inter-phase dependencies
- [x] **Architecture**: ADR-based decisions
- [x] **Notes**: Task generation guidance
- [x] **Scope**: Requirement coverage mapping

---

## ADR Template Level

<!-- INIT: Select based on project complexity -->

| Level | When to Use | Required Fields |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lightweight | Simple decisions, single-option obvious | Status, Context, Decision, Consequences |
| Standard | Multiple valid options | All except Confirmation |
| Full | Critical/security decisions | All fields |

**Selected for this project:** <!-- INIT: Lightweight | Standard | Full --> Standard

### ADR Format

```markdown
### ADR-001: [Short title of solved problem and solution]

**Status**: proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded by ADR-XXX
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Decision-makers**: [list]

#### Context and Problem Statement

[Describe context and problem in 2-3 sentences or as a question]

#### Decision Drivers

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, concern]
* [driver 2]

#### Considered Options

1. [option 1]
2. [option 2]
3. [option 3]

#### Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "[option 1]", because [justification].

**Consequences**:
* Good, because [positive consequence]
* Bad, because [negative consequence]

**Confirmation**: [How implementation/compliance will be confirmed]

#### Traceability

- **Requirements**: REQ-XXX
- **Affects Tasks**: TASK-XXX (populated after /tasks)
```

## Workflow

1. **Locate specs** - Find spec files in speckit/
2. **Assess complexity** - Single domain vs multi-domain
3. **PLANS coverage scan** - Evaluate all 5 categories
4. **Generate plans** - Create plan.md (and domain plans if complex)
5. **Create ADRs** - Document architecture decisions with rationale
6. **Validate ADRs** - Run ADR validator agent
7. **Validate checklist** - 7-point checklist before completion
8. **Report** - Coverage summary with recommendations

---

## ADR Validation (Agent)

After creating ADRs, invoke the ADR validator agent to ensure completeness.

**Invoke via Task tool:**
```
subagent_type: "speckit-generator:adr-validator"
prompt: "Validate ADRs in speckit/plan.md at [SELECTED_LEVEL] level"
```

The agent will check:
- All required fields present for the selected level
- Content meets quality requirements
- Status consistency (rejected ADRs have rationale, etc.)

**Handle results:**
- PASS: Proceed to 7-point validation
- WARN: Review warnings, fix if blocking
- FAIL: Must fix before proceeding

## Output Structure

**Simple (single domain)**:
```
speckit/
├── spec.md
└── plan.md
```

**Complex (multi-domain)**:
```
speckit/
├── spec.md
├── plan.md              # Master plan with domain references
└── plans/
    ├── domain-a-plan.md
    ├── domain-b-plan.md
    └── domain-c-plan.md
```

## Plan Content

Plans contain:
- Requirements mapping (which spec sections covered)
- Architecture decisions (ADR format)
- Implementation approach (phases, NOT tasks)
- Verification strategy
- Notes for task generation

Plans do NOT contain:
- Individual tasks (that's /tasks)
- Implementation code
- Detailed how-to instructions

## Complexity Detection

| Indicator | Simple | Complex |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Domains | Single | Multiple distinct |
| Page count | <10 pages | >10 pages |
| Stakeholder count | 1-2 | 3+ |

User can override detection.

## Idempotency
- Detects existing plans
- Offers update or regenerate
- Preserves manual edits with warning
- ADRs with `accepted` status never auto-modified

---

## 7-Point Validation Checklist

Before completing plan generation, verify ALL items:

| # | Check | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Requirements mapping complete | [ ] |
| 2 | Coverage status documented per PLANS category | [ ] |
| 3 | ADRs have all required fields for their level | [ ] |
| 4 | Phase sequencing valid (no circular deps) | [ ] |
| 5 | Traceability established (REQ → Phase → ADR) | [ ] |
| 6 | Task generation notes present for each phase | [ ] |
| 7 | Markdown structure valid | [ ] |

---

## Outputs

| Output | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Master plan | `speckit/plan.md` |
| Domain plans (if complex) | `speckit/plans/*.md` |

---

## Ralph Loop Mode (Autonomous Planning)

<!-- INIT: Customize based on ralph-loop plugin detection -->

**Status**: <!-- INIT: ✓ Enabled | ✗ Disabled --> ✗ Disabled (ralph-loop plugin not installed)

<!-- INIT: If ralph-loop NOT detected, include this section: -->
To enable autonomous planning mode, install the ralph-loop plugin:
```
/install-plugin ralph-loop
```

<!-- INIT: If ralph-loop IS detected, include this section instead:
**Status**: ✓ Enabled (ralph-loop plugin detected)

Use `--ralph` flag for autonomous plan generation:
```
/plan --ralph                    # Until all ADRs have status: accepted
/plan --ralph --coverage 100     # Until 100% requirement coverage
```

### Exit Criteria
- All PLANS categories at ✓ Complete status
- All ADRs have status: accepted or rejected
- Coverage target reached (if specified)
- Hard limit: 20 iterations
-->

## GATE: Required Before Proceeding

**STOP after plan generation. DO NOT proceed to `/tasks` automatically.**

After generating plans, you MUST:

1. **Present a plan summary** to the user showing:
   - PLANS coverage summary (5 categories)
   - Number of plans created (master + domain plans if complex)
   - ADR count and decisions made
   - Any assumptions or open questions identified

2. **Recommend next steps**:
   - Run `/analyze` to check plan compliance with constitution.md
   - Run `/clarify` if any `[TBD]` or `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items exist
   - Review plans manually before approval

3. **Wait for explicit user approval** before proceeding to tasks

## Handoffs

### Analyze Plan for Consistency
Run analysis to check plan compliance with constitution.md and find gaps.

Use: `/analyze`

### Clarify Ambiguities
If any `[TBD]` or `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items exist in the plan.

Use: `/clarify`

### Generate Tasks
After plan is approved, generate implementation tasks.

Use: `/tasks`
