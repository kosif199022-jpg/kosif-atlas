## Users

Users piloting one or more Claude Code agents across several projects at once. The cockpit lives on a second screen, glanced at while the agent works: where is each session heading (the goal), what turns has it taken (the decision trail), what is it doing right now (the live transcript). The defining moment is `needs_your_call` — autopilot hands the stick back and the user must choose a heading. They are rarely reading every line; they are monitoring instruments and waiting for the one moment that needs them.

## Product Purpose

Cockpit is the windshield to token-atlas's rear-view mirror. Where token-atlas reflects on what already happened (spend, model mix, rhythm), cockpit looks forward: the destination you set, the course the agent is plotting toward it, and the forks where you take the controls. Success means users can glance over, read in two seconds whether a session is on course or waiting for them, drop into the live feed when they want detail, and answer a `needs_your_call` without leaving the seat.

## Brand Personality

Sitting in the pilot's seat of a spacecraft, flying toward a destination through deep space. Composed, in control, instrument-literate. The mood is the quiet of a night flight deck: dark cabin, lit instruments, the destination ahead. Not frantic, not idle, ready. The agent flies; you watch the heading and take the stick when it matters.

Active, not ambient. The interface should feel like a control surface you could act on at any second, not a passive screensaver. But the action lives in the content (the decisions, the feed, the call to act), while the cosmos stays atmosphere, never spectacle.

## Anti-references

For shared use, the two things to avoid most:

- **Cheap sci-fi.** The flight-deck aesthetic is embraced (a HUD viewport, screen-styled panels, a forward warp), but executed with restraint. Reject heavy neon glow, blinking-everything, fake telemetry, holographic chrome, LCARS curves, novelty space fonts, and a hyperspace-fast starfield. Premium HUD, not a movie set.
- **Generic dark SaaS.** Pure `#000` (or near-black neutral) plus one corporate blue accent, the Vercel/Linear-clone dark template. Cockpit's dark is a tinted deep-space cosmos, and its accent is not flat blue.

Also retired: the current flat light-neutral build (the thing this redesign replaces) and any cold un-tinted gray.

## Design Principles

1. **Forward, not backward.** Every surface answers "where is this going / what does it need from me," never "what did this cost." Cost and history are token-atlas's job. Cockpit faces the windshield.
2. **Cold is autopilot, warm is your turn.** The cosmos and its cool navigational accent mean the agent is flying itself. The single warm signal color is reserved for the moment the user must act (`needs_your_call`, waiting). Color carries the one distinction that matters.
3. **Instruments over decoration.** The cockpit feel comes from honest instrument readouts — monospace figures, status LEDs, uppercase control-panel legends, tabular timestamps — not from sci-fi styling. If a thing looks like a gauge, it should be measuring something real.
4. **Content first, cosmos second.** The deep-space backdrop and stardust are atmosphere held at low intensity. The transcript and decision log must stay readable for a long session; the space never competes with the words.
5. **Glanceable in two seconds.** On-course vs needs-you must be legible from across the room — through a status LED's color and pulse, not through reading text.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Dark theme is intrinsic to the product (deep space), so contrast on dark is the priority: target WCAG AA for body text (cool near-white starlight on tinted space surface clears AA comfortably; verify muted/faint tiers). The cool-vs-warm semantic (autopilot vs your-turn) must never rely on hue alone — pair it with the status LED's pulse motion, an explicit label, and position so color-blind users still read state. Keyboard focus uses a 2px aurora outline at 2px offset. Reduced-motion freezes the stardust drift and all status-LED pulses to static states. Stardust stays sparse and low-contrast so it never interferes with text legibility or vestibular comfort.
