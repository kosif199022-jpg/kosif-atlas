# /cockpit restart

Bounce the cockpit dashboard daemon onto **this install's code**. Use it
after a plugin update, a `/monitor:install`, or a working-tree edit to the
Rust crate. The running daemon keeps serving the code it booted with. A
plain re-run of `cockpit server` from the same install reuses the running
daemon and changes nothing.

## Step 1 — Restart

```bash
<plugin-root>/skills/cockpit/bin/cockpit restart
```

Optional flags: `--port <n>` sets the port, for when the daemon runs off
5858. `--no-open` skips the browser, for when the user only wants the daemon
refreshed.

Run it in the **foreground**. Do not background it. It kills the live
daemon and rebinds from the install you invoked it from. It verifies that
our root won the port before it returns.

A Claude session's monitor mod respawns the daemon with
`cockpit ensure-daemon` whenever it finds the daemon gone. `restart`
supersedes that respawn and retries past the race. It does not lose the port to a stale install.

## Step 2 — Report

- Exit `0`: tell the user the daemon now runs this install's code. Give the
  URL it printed, default `http://localhost:5858`.
- Exit non-zero: it could not confirm a fresh daemon from this install.
  Another install is contending for the port. Retry once. If it still fails,
  tell the user to restart the Claude session so its mod loads the
  updated plugin.

## Caveat — the mod is loaded once per session

`restart` refreshes the **daemon**: the dashboard, the transcript stream,
and the wait/send broker. It does **not** refresh the monitor **mod** of an
already running Claude session. That mod was loaded from whatever plugin
cache the session started with.

If the fix the user is chasing lives in the mod (`hooks/register.ts`), the
daemon restart is not enough. The user needs to restart the session itself. Say so
plainly. Do not imply that the update fully landed.

## Notes

- `<plugin-root>` is an **absolute filesystem path** resolved per your provider
  reference (Step 0). Never type `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` into a Bash command.
- Restart from the install whose code you want to serve. The repo's
  shim serves the repo with `COCKPIT_BIN` set to its release build. The updated plugin cache's shim serves that cache.
