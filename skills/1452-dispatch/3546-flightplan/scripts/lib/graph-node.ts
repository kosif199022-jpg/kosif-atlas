 * The readiness rule lives here alone: a dependency is satisfied only when the
 * upstream node is *validly* complete. A task claiming `Status: done` over an
 * unticked gate box, or a graph node whose trail declared `failed`, keeps
 * blocking, so a lost gate result can never unlock downstream work. `findReady`
 * (the scout CLI) and `deriveTaskViews` (the dashboard) both read this, so the
 * two can never disagree about what blocks, and a graph run and a task tree are
 * judged by one rule.
