 * Autopilot's resume takes a step (`--from dev|verify|judge`) and an attempt
 * number. Both used to be read off the JSONL by eye, and the two ways to get
 * that wrong are not symmetric: picking a step too EARLY re-pays for work that
 * already landed, while picking one too LATE takes unfinished work as
 * satisfied. The second is silent, so the choice belongs in a tested function.
 *
 * A failed drift re-verify supersedes the verdict that preceded it.
 * The derivation never suggests skipping the binary gate. Two reasons, and both
 * are load-bearing rather than caution: `--from judge` means a person performed
 * that gate and signed for it, which is a human decision no trail can make; and
 * the judge grounds correctness in the verifier's RAW evidence, which lives only
 * in the orchestrator's memory and dies with the run. The trail keeps the
 * verifier's one-line message, not its output. So `verify` is the earliest
 * honest resume point whenever a machine gate is needed at all.
