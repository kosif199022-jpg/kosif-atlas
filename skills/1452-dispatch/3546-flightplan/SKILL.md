# Flightplan

Interview thoroughly, then commit a complete blueprint to disk so a *different* session — possibly a sub-agent — executes each piece cold. `hop` is the lighter sibling: it plans and executes in this conversation.

- Executing now, single session, small scope → **`hop`**.
- Recording what you want with no solution decided yet → **`preflight`** (writes `INTENT.md`, which this skill reads later).
- Multi-stage, multi-file, handed to a sub-agent, or decisions frozen in version-controlled docs → **`flightplan`**.
- Unsure? Ask *"executing now, or saving for later?"* Later = `flightplan`.

The output is three layers:

1. **`docs/<topic>/PLAN.md`** — master spec, single source of truth for decisions and scope.
2. **`docs/<topic>/tasks/_context/*.md`** — shared context every task references.
3. **`docs/<topic>/tasks/<bucket>/NN-<slug>.md`** — one file per executable unit, self-contained. `_context/` plus the task file is everything an executor needs.

**Two non-negotiables**, because the whole artifact depends on them: enter plan mode before any output, and ask every interview question through `AskUserQuestion` — structured options stay reviewable, plain text gets lost.

## Setup

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is **not** reliably set in Bash. Take the skill's load-time *"Base directory for this skill"* banner and set `SCRIPTS="<base-dir>/scripts"`. Every command below uses `bun "$SCRIPTS"/...`.

**OpenCode only**: there is no banner. Set `SCRIPTS=~/.config/opencode/skills/flightplan/scripts`; `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty there.

**Waypoint mode**: if the request targets a specific waypointed project (`docs/<proj>/WAYPOINTS.md`, a named leg, or a roadmap), read `references/waypoint-mode.md` and follow it instead of the steps below. An ordinary "spec this out" stays in normal mode even when a roadmap exists elsewhere.

## Process

### Step 1 — Enter plan mode

Call `EnterPlanMode` immediately, before any text output or question. Skip if already in plan mode.

### Step 2 — Confirm the run options

Ask these **before the interview**, in one `AskUserQuestion` call. A question asked an hour later lands on a user who has stopped tracking the details, so every choice the run needs gets settled while attention is highest. After the plan is approved in Step 6, the rest of the run is unattended, except an impeccable design phase or a review that ends without converging.

**Review engine** — who critiques the written tree in Step 7. All three share one source of criteria; only the reviewer changes.

1. **Codex (Recommended)** — cross-vendor critique an all-Claude author can't produce.
2. **OpenCode** — also cross-vendor; pick it to use opencode's models.
3. **Opus** — a fresh context-less Claude reviewer; needs no external CLI.

**Review depth** — how many review→fix cycles Step 7 runs.

| Tier | Fits | Floor | Checkpoint | Cap | Narrow |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Light** | ≤ 5 tasks, one bucket | 2 | 3 | 4 | +5 |
| **Standard (Recommended)** | 6–15 tasks, 2–3 buckets | 2 | 5 | 8 | +5 |
| **Deep** | 16+ tasks, 4+ buckets, migration or greenfield | 3 | 8 | 12 | +5 |

Floor, checkpoint, cap, and narrow phase are defined in Step 7. Recommend `Standard` unless the request already reads clearly small or clearly sprawling.

Carry both answers to Step 7. The tier is a guess about a tree that doesn't exist yet — Step 5 restates it beside the finished task index, which is the user's one chance to correct it. After that, honor the pick, except for Step 7's single evidence-based re-cut.

### Step 3 — Interview until shared understanding

**Mission**: don't stop until both sides understand every part of the plan. Treat the design as a tree of decisions and walk one branch at a time. There is no round cap — stop when the tree is fully walked, not when a counter expires.

1. **Walk one branch to completion** before its siblings.
2. **Resolve upstream choices first.** Ask in dependency order; surface the dependency when it isn't obvious.
3. **Recommend an answer to every question.** First `AskUserQuestion` option carries `(Recommended)` plus rationale, so the user reacts instead of designing from scratch.
4. **Ask 1–2 questions per turn.** Multi-question calls only for tightly coupled pairs.
5. **Reflect back what's decided when a branch closes**, and get it confirmed.

`references/interview-guide.md` holds the per-topic question banks, tree-walking examples, question-design checklist, and stop criteria.

**When `docs/<slug>/INTENT.md` exists, read it first.** It answers *why* and *what*, never *how*, so it pre-fills some dimensions below and none of the rest. Confirm what it already settled in **one** `AskUserQuestion` batch — an intent can be weeks old and the want may have moved — then interview only the gaps. Do not re-ask what it answers; do not treat it as answering more than it does.

**Never generate the tree from INTENT.md alone.** Architecture, bucketing, cross-bucket dependencies, verification commands, and eval rubrics are absent from it by design, so skipping the interview means inventing all of them and rendering a fuzzy input as a confident tree. The intent shortens the interview; it does not replace it.

Carry INTENT.md's Open questions into PLAN.md's — each is either resolved during this interview or restated there. When a decision here contradicts the intent, say so out loud and record it under PLAN.md's `## Context`. **Leave INTENT.md unmodified**: it is the baseline, and editing it to match the plan destroys the only record of the drift.

**Required dimensions** — resolve each, or explicitly defer it to Open Questions:

- **Topic slug** — kebab-case, for `docs/<topic>/`. The moment it's agreed, check collision: `bun "$SCRIPTS"/scaffold.ts --check <slug>` prints `OK`, `INTENT: <path>`, or `EXISTS: <suggested -vN slug>`. `INTENT` is not a collision — read that file per the paragraph above and keep the slug. On a real collision, pause and ask: merge, version-bump, or abort.
- **Problem & users** — who it's for, what changes after it ships.
- **Scope boundaries** — the explicit Non-goals list.
- **Tech constraints** — stack, conventions, deployment target, integrations, version pins.
- **Architecture** — how pieces fit, where new code lives, what talks to what.
- **Bucketing** — `ui/backend/api`, by phase, by feature, or a single `work/` bucket for short plans. **`review` is reserved**: it holds the closing task and nothing else. Never put feature work there, and never name a feature bucket `review`.
- **Cross-bucket dependencies** — which task in A unblocks which task in B.
- **Acceptance criteria & verification** — per requirement, how it gets validated. **Ask which checks a person has to perform**, and tag each one `- [ ] (human) …` (see `references/task-template.md`). Untagged, such an item guarantees a park: autopilot's verifier can only fail a check it cannot run, so the task burns every attempt on work that was already correct. Tagged, the verifier skips it and the run reports it as owed at the end. `lint-task.ts` rejects a gate section whose items are *all* tagged, so keep at least one check a command can make.
- **Eval rubric** — the graded quality bar on top of the binary gate. Recommend the defaults (`Correctness ×3 / Test coverage ×2 / Interface & readability ×1 / Assumptions & docs ×1`, pass `> 4.0`, `Correctness < 4` veto) and adapt. A shared bar goes in `_context/rubric.md`.
- **Final review** — every plan ends with one terminal task marked `> **Final review**: true` whose `Depends on` reaches every other task, transitively. **It always lives at `review/01`** — its own bucket, never appended as the next number in a feature bucket. It gates integration, consistency, regressions, and whether the PLAN goal was met — it does not re-score individual tasks. Offer a low-weight **Leanness** axis on its rubric too (see `references/task-template.md`); only the whole diff reveals accumulated over-engineering. `lint-task.ts` requires it (single-task plans exempt), and requires its `## Verification` to run a test suite whenever the tree runs tests anywhere.
- **Visual design** — when the plan builds or reshapes UI and the `impeccable` skill is available, ask whether to design it with impeccable. A yes becomes the design phase in Step 6, which ends in an approved HTML mock. Skip the question when either condition fails.
- **Conventions worth freezing** — commit style, code style, file layout, naming. These become `_context/shared.md`.
- **Failure modes & rollback**.

**For writing topics**, translate: Architecture → outline/section structure, Tech constraints → style decisions, Failure modes → revision and review strategy. Drop what doesn't apply.

### Step 4 — Draft PLAN.md inside plan mode

Follow `references/plan-template.md`. PLAN.md carries all decisions, requirements, constraints, bucketing rationale, and the task index. Show its full content via the plan so the user can review it.

### Step 5 — Exit plan mode

Call `ExitPlanMode` once PLAN.md is drafted. Always exit, even with open questions — record those in PLAN.md's "Open Questions".

Restate the Step 2 options — engine and depth tier — in one line as part of the plan, right beside the task index. The tier was picked before the task count existed, so this is where a wrong guess gets caught. When the interview chose impeccable, state the design phase in the same line. This is the last decision point: Steps 6–8 ask nothing, except the impeccable design phase, which runs its own questions, and a non-converged review (Step 7).

### Step 6 — On approval, write the files

**Approval** is explicit acceptance: clicks approve, types "yes/approved/go ahead", or equivalent. Silence, "looks ok-ish", and "but can you also…" are **not** approval — keep revising, and write no files until the user accepts.

**Atomicity**: the sequence isn't transactional. Once `scaffold.ts` runs, the tree exists. Two failure classes, two responses:

- **Repairable** (missing task file, lint violation, dead fork) — fix that file in place and re-run the step. Never delete the tree.
- **Unrecoverable** (wrong slug or buckets, tree too damaged to reason about) — `trash docs/<slug>/` and re-run from scaffold. Only ever trash a tree *this run* created; if `docs/<slug>/` predates this run, stop and ask.

Either way, never leave a half-written tree.

**Bucket names are single kebab tokens** with no internal dashes (`ui`, `backend`, `api`, `work`). `lint-task.ts` and `build-readme.ts` parse the H1 `BUCKET` as one uppercase token, so a dashed name scaffolds but fails validation.

1. **Scaffold the tree** — deterministic `mkdir` only, no stub files:
   ```bash
   bun "$SCRIPTS"/scaffold.ts <slug> <bucket1>,<bucket2>,...,review
   ```
   Creates `tasks/_context/` and one dir per bucket. The root is created non-recursively, so a slug created between the Step 3 check and now throws EEXIST instead of silently overwriting. The one root it merges into is a dir holding only `INTENT.md`, which it leaves in place.

   **Pass `review` as the last bucket on every multi-task plan.** The closing task lives at `review/01` and nowhere else. Omit it only for a single-task plan, which is exempt from the final-review rule entirely.

   **When the interview chose impeccable, run the design phase now** — after scaffold, because scaffold refuses a root that already holds files, and before step 2, because `_context/design.md` is derived from its result.
   - Pre-warm the engine before invoking the skill: run `<impeccable skill dir>/scripts/impeccable context` once at the maximum Bash timeout, because its first run downloads the engine and the skill's own Setup runs it under the default timeout. When the skill directory is unknown until the skill loads, make this the first Setup command, at the same timeout. When that run fails or times out, take impeccable's own "Launcher unavailable" path and continue from its reference docs. Never re-run it in a loop.
   - Invoke the `impeccable` skill with `shape <feature>`, followed by the interview's summary: goal, users, states, constraints, and the existing visual world. Shape then needs a compact confirmation, not a second discovery round. Let it run whichever path it picks, and answer its questions with the user.
   - Run the phase code-led: author every decision-page payload with a code-led `buildPath`. When a card or comp needs an image, try in this order: `relay:codex image`, one image at a time since it is not concurrency-safe; then impeccable's `generate-image` API, after the user agrees to its cost; then no image, carrying the card in HTML alone. Open each image before using it.
   - Draw the HTML yourself, since shape returns a brief and never code. Ground it in the real UI first: a screenshot, the real colours, the real assets. Load impeccable's `reference/craft-floor.md` before drawing.
   - Draw two or three layout structures side by side in `docs/<slug>/design/options.html`, with synthetic data and live hover. When impeccable ran a decision page, the user already picked the direction there, so compare structures inside that direction only. When the visual world is established and no decision page ran, options.html is the comparison, inside the existing world.
   - Write the approved direction as `docs/<slug>/design/mock.html`: one self-contained file, no network, drawing every state the tasks must build. Use the target's real values, and comment each CSS custom property with the target token it stands for. Draw it in HTML even when the target is not the web.
   - Render each page in a browser (`herdr-browser` when Herdr runs) and inspect the screenshot before showing it. Open the page for the user, not just its path. Re-render and re-check after every revision, until the user approves the mock.
   - Reconcile PLAN.md with the approved mock: a design edit that changes a plan decision changes PLAN.md too. When the mock needs work the approved task index lacks, ask before adding tasks, and name each added task in the Step 8 recap. A grown tree is evidence for Step 7's one tier re-cut.

2. **Write PLAN.md and every `_context/*.md` yourself** — never delegate these. They are the contract every task file agrees to, and a single author is what keeps them from drifting (PLAN.md is already drafted, so this is transcription, plus any design-phase reconciliation). Write `_context/rubric.md` first when the bar is shared. Finish all of them **before** spawning anything: the forks read these files off disk, so the finalized file is the contract, not whatever they inherited from the transcript. Follow `references/plan-template.md` and `references/context-files.md`; don't improvise structure. After a design phase, inline every value the mock uses into `_context/design.md`, in impeccable's DESIGN.md format, list it under Required reading in every UI task, and give the task that first makes the UI visible a `- [ ] (human)` check against `docs/<slug>/design/mock.html` opened side by side.

3. **Fan the task files out to forked subagents** — one `Agent` per task file, all in a single message so they run concurrently. Use `subagent_type: "fork"` and only that; omitting it starts a fresh, context-less agent that never saw the interview and will invent the decisions.

   **Write them inline and serially instead** when the tree has ≤3 task files (spawn overhead beats the gain), or when the `Agent` tool is unavailable because flightplan is itself running inside a subagent (a fork is a leaf and cannot spawn). Beyond ~10 tasks, spawn one batch per bucket so a failed batch stays contained.

   **Decide the whole task list first** — bucket, `NN`, slug, title, `Depends on`, `Blocks`, and which task carries `> **Final review**: true`. Forks fill in prose only; if they pick numbering or dependency edges, two will collide on the same `NN`.

   Give each fork: the absolute output path `docs/<slug>/tasks/<bucket>/NN-<slug>.md`; the absolute path to `references/task-template.md`; the exact H1 and every header field you decided; the `_context/*.md` files it must list under `Required reading`, by relative path; and the interview substance this task needs — goal, files to create/modify, signatures, schemas, acceptance criteria, verification commands, rubric anchors (or "reuse the shared bar in `../_context/rubric.md`").

   **Tell each fork to read `task-template.md` and every `_context/*.md` it will list, before writing.** A fork inherits the transcript, not the files — relying on the inherited copy is how a task file ends up citing `../_context/shared.md` while contradicting it, and no linter catches that disagreement.

   **Bound each fork explicitly.** A fork inherits full tool access and autonomy, and will overstep a narrow brief unless told:
   - Write exactly that one file. Edit nothing else.
   - Do not run `scaffold.ts`, `lint-task.ts`, `build-readme.ts`, or `review-plan.ts`.
   - Do not implement the work the task describes. This is a spec, not the code.
   - On lint feedback, fix and rewrite that file until clean, then stop.
   - Report one line: the path written, plus any unresolved violation.

   **Join before moving on.** A fork can die on an API error, time out, or claim success without leaving a file, and none of that raises on its own. Keep the expected-path list, and snapshot the worktree right before the spawn:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/q-lab/dispatch/flightplan/<project>/<slug>   # <project>: basename of the repo root
   git status --short -uall | sort > /tmp/q-lab/dispatch/flightplan/<project>/<slug>/status.txt
   ```
   Once every fork returns:
   ```bash
   ls docs/<slug>/tasks/*/*.md      # every expected path present?
   git status --short -uall | sort | comm -13 /tmp/q-lab/dispatch/flightplan/<project>/<slug>/status.txt -   # what changed since the spawn?
   ```
   Write any missing file yourself, inline — don't re-spawn the batch, don't trash the tree (a missing file is repairable). Revert any new path outside `docs/<slug>/`; the brief forbids it but nothing enforces it. The snapshot keeps what existed before the spawn, such as the design phase's `PRODUCT.md` and `.impeccable/`. `-uall` lists each file inside an untracked directory, so a new file there still shows. A file already dirty before the spawn keeps its status line when a fork edits it again, so the snapshot cannot catch that edit.

   Every task file needs a `## Eval rubric` (threshold line + weighted table), and exactly one task carries `> **Final review**: true`. See `references/task-template.md`.

4. **Lint the whole tree** — catches what the per-file hook can't see (duplicate `bucket/NN`, broken cross-bucket deps). Run it yourself after every fork reports, never inside a fork:
   ```bash
   bun "$SCRIPTS"/lint-task.ts docs/<slug>/tasks
   ```
   Pass the **tasks directory**, not a glob; the script walks bucket dirs and auto-skips `_context/` and `README.md`. Fix and re-run until it reports no violations.

   **Every task in this tree may run beside another one.** Under Claude Code, autopilot runs every ready task of a wave in parallel, each in its own worktree, subject to **Max parallel**. It lands each task into the main tree only after the task passes its judge. No task commits. Write a task's own files through its worktree: writing them into the main tree is a leak, and autopilot aborts the whole run when it detects one. When tasks share an external live resource that a worktree cannot isolate (a device, a LaunchAgent, a local database), declare `> **Max parallel**: N` in the PLAN.md master-spec header. Do not use a lock rule in `_context/` for this. Tree lint prints a `[serial-undeclared]` advisory when it finds such prose without the header.

   Under OpenCode, the hand-driven loop still shares one working tree (see `autopilot/references/opencode.md`). A sibling's uncommitted edits are visible there. When the plan will run under OpenCode, set `> **Max parallel**: 1` for a shared build target that compiles every file. Never assert anything about the state of the whole tree in a task's verification: the runner edits the task file on both runtimes, and siblings share the tree under OpenCode. Assert on this task's own declared files, by name.

5. **Generate `tasks/README.md`** — index, dep graphs, cross-bucket table:
   ```bash
   bun "$SCRIPTS"/build-readme.ts docs/<slug>/tasks
   ```
   It fails loudly on malformed or duplicate-ref tasks rather than dropping them, and preserves the human-authored prologue/epilogue between the generated markers. Two of those sections are yours to fill, and the skeleton ships them as placeholder comments that will otherwise be delivered as-is: **`## Where to start`** (name the first task file) and **`## Known gaps`**. `tasks/README.md` is what an executor opens, so a gap recorded only in PLAN.md never reaches them. Revisit both after Step 7 — most gaps surface during the review loop, not the interview.

### Step 7 — Review the written artifact (engine and depth chosen in Step 2; iterate to convergence)

Once lint passes, run an independent review over the whole tree, then **loop**: review → fix → re-review. This is a mandatory content-quality gate, a different lens from `lint-task.ts`'s structural checks. Cross-file inconsistencies, vague acceptance criteria, oversized tasks, and goal drift are real defects here, not nitpicks.

**Make one fresh review directory before pass 1**, and call the path it prints `<review>`: `mkdir -p /tmp/q-lab/dispatch/flightplan/<project>/<slug> && mktemp -d /tmp/q-lab/dispatch/flightplan/<project>/<slug>/review-XXXXXX`. A fixed path would hand an earlier review's `pass-1.md` to this one.

**Run the engine the user picked in Step 2 — do not ask again.** Ask here only when Step 2 never happened (a resumed or handed-over session). All three share one source of criteria — the 7-point checklist baked into `review-plan.ts`. Only *who critiques* changes.

- **Codex** (default) — the cross-vendor signal an all-Claude author can't produce:
  ```bash
  bun "$SCRIPTS"/review-plan.ts docs/<slug>
  ```
- **OpenCode** — also cross-vendor; pick it to use opencode's models:
  ```bash
  bun "$SCRIPTS"/review-plan.ts docs/<slug> --engine opencode   # optional: --model <provider/model>
  ```
  Both bundle the plan files, so the scope is exactly the tree regardless of other uncommitted changes. If the CLI isn't installed the script exits 0 with a warning — skip the gate, note it as a Known gap in `tasks/README.md`, and go to Step 8.
- **Opus** — a strong Claude reviewer, but **you wrote this plan, so you must not review it yourself**; author bias defeats the gate. Each pass:
  1. Capture the same bundle the CLIs get into a file: `bun "$SCRIPTS"/review-plan.ts docs/<slug> --print > <review>/bundle.md`
  2. Invoke `/relay:claude-cli` with `review --prompt-file <review>/bundle.md --model opus --effort high --headless`. Relay runs a fresh `claude -p` process on opus/high under its read-only review contract. The fresh process starts context-less, so the author never reviews its own plan. A fork would inherit the interview and review its own reasoning, the exact bias this step exists to defeat (the opposite of Step 6's fan-out). `--model` here is this step's fixed choice, not a user pick, so skip relay's save-to-config question. When relay rejects `--effort` as an unknown flag, the installed relay predates it: tell the user to update relay, and do not rerun without the flag.
  3. Take the findings back to the loop. A fresh subagent each pass keeps reviewer ≠ author — the same anti-bias split autopilot uses.

**From pass 2 on, hand the reviewer what the last pass found.** Save each pass's raw findings to `<review>/pass-N.md` (outside the tree — these are scratch, not artifacts), then add `--prior-findings <review>/pass-<N-1>.md` to the next pass's command. It works on all three engines, `--print` included. Every reviewer starts context-less by design, so without this each pass re-files findings you already fixed or already dispositioned, and the loop never reaches a P1-clean pass. The bundle also carries `tasks/README.md`, so a gap banked there is visible to the reviewer as a decision.

**Act on findings between every pass.** Re-reviewing unchanged files just repeats the same findings. Rewrite vague criteria, split tasks that mix concerns, fix goal drift, add missing `Depends on` edges. After any structural change, re-run `lint-task.ts` and `build-readme.ts`. Skip a finding only when it conflicts with an intentional recorded decision — then log it as a Known gap in `tasks/README.md` with the reason, and don't re-fix it when a later pass raises it again.

**Sort every finding into two buckets before deciding anything:**

- **P1 — blocks execution.** A missing or contradicted decision, two files that disagree, an acceptance criterion nobody can verify, a dependency edge the executor cannot satisfy, a task that can't be done from `_context/` plus its own file. An executor hits a P1 and stalls or guesses.
- **P2 — quality.** Wording, ordering, a criterion that could be sharper, a task that could split more cleanly. An executor ships anyway.

**Between the floor and the cap the loop is gated on P1, not on a round number.** A high round count is evidence the plan was harder than the tier guessed, not a reason to stop early.

- **Never fewer than floor passes.** The second cycle, on the improved plan, is the high-value one — the first catches the loud problems, and only the revision exposes what they were masking.
- **Stop at the first P1-clean pass at or past the floor.** P2-only findings — or already-recorded intent — mean the plan is done. Apply the cheap ones, bank the rest as Known gaps, and move on. This is the normal exit.
- **At the checkpoint, if P1s are still arriving, stop patching files and re-cut.** Repeated P1s that far in are symptoms, not defects: the decomposition, a bucket boundary, or a PLAN-level decision is wrong. Fix it at PLAN.md / `_context/` / bucket level, re-run `lint-task.ts` and `build-readme.ts`, then resume the loop. Fixing symptoms one file at a time is what makes a review run long without converging.
- **Re-cut the tier once, mid-loop, when the written tree contradicts it.** The Step 2 bands are stated in task counts, and task count predicts review cost badly: five 200-line task files are a far larger consistency surface than fifteen 40-line ones. Measure the tree you actually wrote — `wc -l docs/<slug>/PLAN.md docs/<slug>/tasks/_context/*.md docs/<slug>/tasks/*/*.md` — and if it is much larger than its band implies, say so and re-pick the tier once, as early as the mismatch shows and before the cap fires. Note any remaining mismatch in the Step 8 recap.
- **Count the open P1s after every pass.** That count is the only convergence signal. Do not compare findings by wording: the files change every pass, so a re-raised defect is never phrased the same way twice and a wording test never fires.
- **End the broad loop at whichever comes first:** the cap is reached with P1s still open, or two consecutive passes past the checkpoint fail to lower the open-P1 count. Both say the same thing — the broad reviewer has stopped producing signal. Neither one ends the review: go to the narrow phase.

**The narrow phase — up to five more passes, blocking findings only.**

A broad prompt aimed at a plan that has already been revised a dozen times manufactures findings, and a reviewer that wants to look thorough files some of them as P1. The narrow instructions (`--narrow`) do not lower the bar — their five qualifying classes are the P1 definition above, restated. What they remove is the padding pressure: no P2 channel, at most five findings, and `No blocking findings.` sanctioned as a legitimate verdict.

```bash
bun "$SCRIPTS"/review-plan.ts docs/<slug> --narrow --prior-passes <broad passes run> \
  --prior-findings <review>/pass-<last>.md
```

On the Opus engine, add the same two flags to the `--print` capture (`--print --narrow --prior-passes <n>`) and invoke relay exactly as before — `/relay:claude-cli`, never a fork.

- **Carry the still-open P1s in on `--prior-findings`, always.** The narrow reviewer must *adjudicate* what the broad loop left open, not merely fail to mention it. A P1 that survives adjudication is real. One the narrow pass drops was noise — and you may only treat it as noise because a reviewer was shown it and declined it, never because the prompt changed underneath it.
- **Reset the convergence counter at the switch.** The two-consecutive-passes rule compares open-P1 counts, and a new prompt is a new denominator. The count falling on the first narrow pass is the prompt working, not the plan improving. Do not compare across the switch; start counting again from the first narrow pass, so ending the narrow phase early needs two consecutive narrow passes that fail to lower it.
- **Fix between narrow passes exactly as before.** A narrow P1 is by construction blocking, so it gets fixed, not banked. Re-run `lint-task.ts` and `build-readme.ts` after any structural change.
- **The first `No blocking findings.` ends the review.** That is the narrow phase's normal exit and the plan ships. `--narrow` is only ever entered after a full broad loop, so the floor is long satisfied.
- **Five narrow passes is the hard end.** Reaching it, or two consecutive narrow passes that fail to lower the count, is the real non-convergence — and now it means something: two different reviewers, at two different bars, both kept finding the same blocking defects. Stop.
- **Never enter the narrow phase early.** It is a response to an observed symptom, not a cheaper default. A plan that clears the broad loop never sees it, and narrowing before the cap would drop the P2 channel during the passes where wording and task-split findings are still worth having.

**At the end of the narrow phase:**

- **Bank the last pass's findings. Do not fix them.** A fix applied after the final pass is unverified, and an unverified fix inside a tree that reads as reviewed is worse than a recorded gap — the gap gets the executor's attention and the fix does not. If one is trivially safe and you fix it anyway, say plainly in the recap that it was fixed with no confirming pass.
- **Hand the decision back to the user. It is not the end of the conversation.** Give them numbers, not a question they cannot answer. Show the open-P1 count for every pass as a trend, mark where the narrow phase began, name the P1s still open, and offer the three real options: ship with the gaps banked, extend, or re-cut at PLAN level. *"Should I review again?"* is not a decision anyone can make. *"broad 5 → 4 → 4 → 3, narrow 2 → 2, two open, here they are"* is.
- **Extending past the narrow phase needs a named reason and a new bound.** The user may spend more of their budget — but only against a hypothesis for why the next pass would differ: a root-cause fix that should collapse a whole class of findings, or a tier that was visibly wrong. "One more look" is not a reason. State the new bound before starting and stop there. Every rule above still applies inside the extension, so two consecutive passes that fail to lower the count end it early no matter what the new bound said.
- **A non-converged tree is handed over, not hidden.** List every open P1 in `tasks/README.md`'s Known gaps, and lead the Step 8 recap with it.

### Step 8 — Stop. Do not execute.

Tell the user where the files live and that `/autopilot <slug>` executes the tree; name the first task for anyone running it by hand. Do not start implementing — the whole point is that execution happens elsewhere with fresh context.

**Hand back a short recap in the user's reply language** (the files stay English; only this recap is localized). Glanceable: the goal in one line, the buckets and task counts, the suggested first task, and any Known gaps. It lets the user sanity-check the plan's shape without opening every file — it is not a re-paste of the plan.

**If Step 7 ended on non-convergence, that goes first**, before the goal line: how many P1s stayed open, after how many passes, and what they are. Everything else in the recap is secondary to a tree the review could not clear. **Say so too when the narrow phase is what cleared the tree** — "the broad loop capped with N P1s open; the narrow phase cleared it in K passes" — because a plan that needed the fallback is not the same as one that converged on its own, and the difference is the user's to weigh.

The next executor can ask "what should I work on?" — this lists tasks whose dependencies are all `done`:

```bash
bun "$SCRIPTS"/next-ready.ts docs/<slug>/tasks
```

## Core principles for the artifacts

1. **Task files are self-contained.** An executor needs only `_context/` + the task file. Never reference PLAN.md or another task file. → `references/task-template.md`
2. **PLAN.md is the source of truth; `_context/` mirrors it.** When a decision changes, update those two, not the task files. → `references/context-files.md`
3. **A bucket directory is always required.** Never write task files directly under `tasks/`; short plans use a single `tasks/work/` plus `tasks/review/` for the closing task. This keeps every `Required reading` path identical.
4. **Mark unknowns explicitly** as Known gaps in `tasks/README.md`, never as vague tasks. → `references/readme-template.md`
5. **Write the artifacts in English.** A sub-agent picks them up cold, so English keeps them portable regardless of the interview language. (Exception: a writing-topic plan whose deliverable is in another language may use it for content samples.) Interview in whatever language the user prefers; hand back the Step 8 recap in theirs.

## File-writing rules

- All paths are relative to the current working directory unless the user says otherwise.
- **Every script in this skill trusts your cwd. Run them from the repo root.** They resolve `docs/<slug>/` against wherever the shell happens to be, and a compound command containing `cd` moves that shell for the rest of the session. The tree then scaffolds somewhere real but wrong, and every later step points at a path that does not exist.
- **Read the absolute path `scaffold.ts` prints.** It reports where the tree actually landed, not the argument you passed. If that is not the repo root, stop and fix it before writing any content — a misplaced tree is `trash` and re-scaffold, which is cheap now and expensive after five task files.
- A script that cannot find its target says so and exits `2`. Exit `2` never means "your tree is bad", it means "that path is not there" — check the printed working directory before you go looking at task files. `review-plan.ts` in particular reserves exit `1` for the reviewer's own verdict.
- Kebab-case for `<topic>` and `<slug>`. Zero-pad `NN` to two digits.
- Never overwrite an existing `docs/<topic>/` without explicit confirmation (collision check happens in Step 3).

## Automatic lint hook

A dispatch hook (`hooks/register.ts` on Claude Code, `hooks/flightplan-lint.sh` on OpenCode) lints each task file (`docs/<slug>/tasks/<bucket>/NN-*.md` carrying the template's Required-reading header) right after an `Edit|Write`, and reports violations as hook feedback. Writing `_context/` before task files keeps it quiet during normal flow. It cannot see files written by Bash, relay, or an external CLI, so it is early feedback, not the gate — Step 6's whole-tree lint is.

## Bundled scripts

Reach for these instead of doing the mechanical work by hand. Each exports a tested pure function.

- `scripts/scaffold.ts` — collision check (`--check`) and dir-tree creation (Steps 3 and 6).
- `scripts/lint-task.ts` — validates task files against the self-containment contract + the mandatory Eval-rubric shape.
- `scripts/build-readme.ts` — regenerates `tasks/README.md` index / dep graphs from task headers.
- `scripts/review-plan.ts` — Step 7's plan review; flags as used there. Exit code mirrors the reviewer; a missing CLI exits 0 with a warning.
- `scripts/next-ready.ts` — lists tasks whose dependencies are all `done` (executor-session helper).
- `scripts/score-task.ts`, `mark-done.ts`, `flightlog.ts`, `worktree.ts` — executor-side tools driven by `autopilot`; flightplan does not run them.
