/*
 * DIRECTION CONTRACT — Interlocking Panel
 *
 * THESIS: a flight plan is a route set through a signalling panel, not a bag of
 * coloured boxes on a canvas. It refuses the node-graph editor this category
 * always ships — and that this file used to be.
 * OWN-WORLD: a railway NX entrance-exit desk on Hangar's near-black ground.
 * Buckets are named running roads; tasks are berth plates on them; cross-bucket
 * dependencies are crossovers changing road; gates are signal heads.
 * State is lit, not filled: every state colour carries lit / base / unlit steps
 * on one hue, by value alone — no gradient and no shadow, and no box takes a
 * corner above 4px. The panel held to exactly two angles — horizontal and 45 —
 * until the crossover became a curve; that is now its one curved element, and
 * the rule it broke is recorded rather than quietly dropped.
 * STORY: the reader asks what is holding a task up and what moves when it
 * lands, and reads the answer as one lit line instead of tracing edges.
 * FIRST VIEWPORT: roads stack down the pane with their bucket names in the left
 * and right gutters; berths sit along each road at dependency depth as plates
 * carrying their own ref and token, lit down the leading edge; crossovers carry
 * every dependency that leaves its own road; the whole field is lit at rest.
 * FORM: Interlocking Panel, rank 1 of my grounded list, taken by the user over
 * the roll's assigned Drawing Sheet. Seed key 5e8c7193.
 * Approved comps: .impeccable/mocks/comp/b-throat.png (rest) + c-route.png
 * (hover). Signature interaction: hovering a berth darkens the panel and lights
 * that task's whole lineage end to end. Motion: segments light, never fade.
 * FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the
 * finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its
 * provenance.

 * would break the stride, which is the only reason slots read as columns across
 * roads. Rounded to a whole pixel for the same reason the gutter is.
 *
 * Both figure columns are held at a fixed width whether or not a reading has
 * arrived — six characters for the tokens (`145.0K`), seven for the elapsed
 * (`12m 34s`). Sizing them to the readings actually present would reflow the
 * entire panel the first time a task reports, and this panel is read while it
 * runs — the elapsed figure ticks every second — so a layout that moves under
 * the reader costs far more than a plate carrying some empty column.
 *
 * The width is the wider of the two lines, not their sum. Splitting the plate
 * onto two lines is what pays for the elapsed column: the ref no longer shares
 * a line with the figures, so the plate came out narrower than the single-line
 * one it replaced even after gaining a second number.
 *
 * There is no cap. A gutter is a flat allowance spent on a road name and can be

   * Columns stay aligned across roads wherever the tree allows it, and the road
   * stays strictly left-to-right, which is the one thing a running line must be.
   *
   * The packing has to settle across roads, not once per road. A berth pushed
   * right to clear its own road is now right of where its dependents' depths
   * expected it, and a single pass leaves those dependents where they were — so
   * the crossover between them runs right-to-left and the panel says a task is
   * waiting on something downstream of it. On the tree that found this,
   * `api/08` packed from depth 5 to slot 7 while `studio/02` stayed at slot 6,
   * and the route it depends on came back up the pane. So a berth also takes a
   * slot past every dependency's slot, and the two constraints are run to a
   * fixed point. It settles for the same reason the depth pass does: both only
   * ever move a berth right, and together they form a DAG once the cycles are
   * held out — a dependency edge raises the depth, a road edge never lowers it,
   * so no chain of the two returns to where it started.
   *
   * A cyclic node is exempt from the dependency floor. Inside a cycle each node
   * demands a slot past the others, which no arrangement satisfies; they already
   * share the one column past the settled graph.

 * A crossover: horizontal run, an S-curve that changes road, horizontal run.
 *
 * A signalling diagram has exactly two angles, and the panel held to them until
 * this: the change of road was a straight 45-degree diagonal, latterly with its
 * corners filleted. Rounding only the joints turned out to be a change the eye
 * cannot find — at any radius small enough to leave the 45 visibly straight, the
 * arc hides inside the 11.9px stroke and the corner still reads as square. So
 * the whole diagonal becomes the curve. What that costs is real: the panel now
 * has one shape that is neither horizontal nor 45, and a reader tracing a line
 * no longer meets only two angles.
 *
 * The reach is the gap, not the drop. Holding 45 forced the diagonal to spend
 * its own vertical drop in horizontal reach, and on a panel four roads tall that
 * was routinely more than the span between the two berths — so most crossovers
 * fell through to the straight-line fallback and the curve was drawn on almost
 * none of them. A curve owes nothing to that ratio: it changes road inside the
 * one gap `turns` reserved however far apart the roads are, which both makes it
 * visible everywhere and *tightens* the old guarantee. The 45-degree diagonal
 * overflowed its reserved gap by however much its drop exceeded the gap width;
 * this cannot leave the gap at all.
 *
 * Both ends leave horizontally, because the curve meets a road there and track
 * that meets track at an angle is a kink. That is what the control points are
 * doing on their endpoints' own y.
 *
 * A free-angle bezier drawn straight between the two berths would abandon the
 * reserved gap outright, and on a real tree it sweeps over the plates on the
 * roads in between. That is the shape this is not.
