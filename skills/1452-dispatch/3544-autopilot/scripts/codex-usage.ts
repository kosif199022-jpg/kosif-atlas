 *   - `input_tokens + output_tokens === total_tokens`, always;
 *   - `cached_input_tokens` is a SUBSET of `input_tokens`, never an addition to it;
 *   - `reasoning_output_tokens` is a subset of `output_tokens`, so it needs no field
 *     of its own — adding one would count reasoning twice;
 *   - `cache_write_input_tokens` was 0 in all 771 rollouts on disk, so whether it sits
 *     inside `input_tokens` is unobservable. `input` is therefore derived by
 *     subtraction rather than copied, which conserves the total whichever it turns out
 *     to be.
 *
 * `cacheWrite` carries the fresh (non-cached) prompt tokens because that is the field
 * the panel prints, and fresh prompt content is what Claude bills as cache creation —
 * see `freshTokens` in dashboard/dist/modules/format.js. `input` stays 0: codex has no
 * counter separate from the prompt total, and inventing a split would inflate the sum.

 * them would make a 40K Claude driver and a 210K codex run indistinguishable from one
 * 250K Claude agent.
 *
 * Two joins, strongest first:
 *
 *  1. **Relay directory.** A live-pane delegation names `/tmp/q-lab/relay/relay/<dir>/live-prompt.md`
 *     in the codex rollout, and the driver's own transcript names `<dir>` in the command
 *     that created it. That is an exact string match on a per-delegation identifier —
 *     no guessing, and it survives parallel waves.
 *  2. **Repo and time window.** The headless path pipes the prompt on stdin, so no
 *     shared identifier reaches the rollout. It falls back to: cwd under the repo root,
 *     and a start inside some driver's [startedAt, lastAt]. Nearest start wins, one
 *     driver per run, so two concurrent delegations cannot both claim one rollout.
 *
 * A run matching neither is dropped rather than spread across the plan: codex sessions
 * the user started by hand share the repo, and folding those in would silently inflate
 * whichever task happened to be running.
 *
 * `openIdentities` carries the fleet identities the flightlog still reports in flight,
 * and it exists because a driver waiting on the codex CLI writes nothing while it
 * waits: its `lastAt` is the moment it shelled out, which is *before* the rollout it is
 * waiting on even opens. Closing the window there hid every live delegation until its
 * driver returned — and with several drivers in flight, only the one still writing (a
 * relay live pane it polls) showed a figure. For an open identity the window has no
 * end; the moment the driver finishes, `lastAt` and the relay directory both land and
 * the ordinary joins take over.
