# Autopilot orchestrator — canonical Workflow script

This is the script the `autopilot` skill bakes and passes to the **Workflow** tool.
Read the three hard constraints in `SKILL.md` first. They explain every awkward-looking choice in this file.

> **OpenCode only**: nothing here applies; follow `~/.config/opencode/skills/autopilot/references/opencode.md`.

The main agent scouts inline. It then runs `scripts/bake-orchestrator.ts`, which bakes the
scouted values into the `CFG` block at the top of the script as literals, and calls
`Workflow({ scriptPath: <the printed path> })`.

Wave loop: `scout → tree guards → derive fresh ready tasks → stall guard → inter-wave commit → budget-floor check → parallel task dispatch, capped by the plan's `maxParallel` → wave-end leak check (except Final review) → reconciliation → abort/no-progress stop`.

Do not rely on the Workflow `args` global: it does not reliably reach the orchestrator, and an unset
`args` makes the scout run `bun undefined/next-ready.ts`, which fails silently as "no work to do".

> **Why every path is absolute (`tasksDir` / `planPath` / `logFile` / `scriptsDir` / `relayPath`):** Workflow agents share no working directory. An agent that `cd`s into `docs/<slug>/tasks/` resolves a relative `logFile` to a nested `docs/<slug>/tasks/docs/<slug>/.flightlog/`, splitting the audit trail in two, and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` never reaches agent Bash. So build `<root>/docs/<slug>/...` from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, resolve `scriptsDir` from the skill's "Base directory for this skill" banner, and resolve `relayPath` during scout. `bake-orchestrator.ts` rejects any relative path, a `~/...` form included.

## The script

`bake-orchestrator.ts` extracts the first fenced `javascript` block in this file and replaces `CFG` values only. Keep the script below as that first block, never write the fence opener in prose above it, and keep each `CFG` field on one `name: value, // comment` line. The explanatory comments ride along; `scriptPath` has no transcription cost to trim.

const devExternalPrompt = (engine, ref, path, attempt, feedback, wtPath) => `
${worktreeRules(wtPath)}
First, announce yourself: bun ${S}/flightlog.ts log ${CFG.logFile} --task ${ref} --role dev --attempt ${attempt} --agent "dev-${engine.label}:${ref}#${attempt}" --phase start
Then proceed.
Use the identical label expression "dev-${engine.label}:${ref}#${attempt}" in both start and end calls. It names this task and attempt, so parallel delegates never close each other's row.

You are the ${engine.label.toUpperCase()} DEV DRIVER for flightplan task ${ref} (tree: ${CFG.tasksDir}). You do NOT write the implementation yourself — you have the ${engine.label} CLI write it, then you report what landed. You do NOT run the task's ## Verification commands: an independent verifier runs them straight after you, and your verdict would carry no weight.
1. Read the task file at ${path} and every file in its "Required reading". Note its "Files to create / modify" list and "Implementation notes".
2. ${STATUS_RULE} Tell the external engine to leave it in-progress too.
${NO_COMMIT_RULE}
3. Build the ${engine.label} instruction from the task file — copy its Goal, "Files to create / modify", Implementation notes, Acceptance criteria, and ## Verification commands across as they are written, and tell ${engine.label} to implement the task fully and stay strictly within the listed files. Tell it to RUN the Verification commands itself and keep working until they pass before it reports back — it holds the shell and the working tree, so it is the only party that can act on red output. Tell it in the same instruction that those commands and the tests they run are FIXED: it fixes the code until a command passes, and never edits, weakens, or skips the command or a test to get there. ${wtPath ? "Include the worktree rules in that instruction, with the exact worktree and main-tree paths. " : ""}Include the no-commit rule in that instruction, in your own words but with the same force: ${engine.label} writes the working tree and would otherwise commit its own work. Give it EVERYTHING up front; the wrapper and the live flag both attach the unattended contract themselves, so the instruction never has to carry it.
   INSTRUCTION SHAPE — three things must never appear in that file. (a) Implementation code you wrote: no ready-to-paste source for the files ${engine.label} is meant to create. A delegate that transcribes your code delivers your solution, and the only reason an external engine writes this task is to get one Claude did not author — pass the task file's notes and let it solve. (b) A softened gate: never reword, weaken, or drop an Acceptance criteria or a Verification command, and never tell ${engine.label} to skip one because it failed or looked unrunnable before. A gate you believe is wrong is a plan defect — leave it standing and let the binary gate judge the result. (c) A claim that existing work is already correct.${attempt > 1 ? `
   RETRY — this is attempt ${attempt}. The previous attempt was rejected:
${feedback}
   Fold that feedback into the instruction so ${engine.label} fixes exactly it. Feedback may only ADD requirements. It may never subtract a verification command, mark a gate optional, or tell ${engine.label} the last attempt's code was already right and only needs re-checking — the rejection means a gate went unmet, and an instruction that opens by excusing the previous attempt reproduces it.` : ''}
4. Make a fresh scratch directory with \`${scratchDir('driver', ref, attempt)}\` and Write that instruction to <dir>/instruction.md, where <dir> is the path it printed — never inside the working tree, never at a fixed path another run may have left behind. Then run this as ONE FOREGROUND Bash call with \`timeout: 600000\` (the Bash tool maximum):
  ${wtPath ? `cd ${wtPath} && ` : ""}${liveDev ? `bun ${CFG.relayPath} ${engine.label} delegate${engine.modelFlag} --prompt-file <dir>/instruction.md --git-scope none --dangerous --no-ask --wait-timeout 480000` : `bun ${S}/${engine.wrapper} delegate${engine.modelFlag} --prompt-file <dir>/instruction.md`}
   WAIT RULE — never improvise a wait. Do NOT set \`run_in_background\`. Do NOT write a shell poll loop (\`while\`, \`jobs\`, \`wait\`, repeated \`tail\`). Every Bash call gets a fresh shell, so \`jobs\` can never see a command an earlier call started: such a loop spins until the 600s cap and burns ten minutes AFTER ${engine.label} has already finished. ${liveDev ? `The \`--wait-timeout 480000\` above is sized to expire inside the 600s cap with margin for relay's pane spawn and cleanup, so this one call normally returns on its own. It can still outrun the cap: when relay cannot spawn a pane it falls back to headless inside the same invocation, and headless has no timeout at all.` : ''} If the harness reports that the call outran the cap and was moved to the background, do not poll: wait for the completion notification, then Read the output file it named, once.
   ${liveDev ? `Relay runs ${engine.label} in a visible herdr live pane, edits the working tree directly, prints the delegate result on stdout, then closes the pane on success. Read that stdout — do NOT go looking for any temp/transcript files.` : `The headless wrapper has ${engine.label} edit the working tree directly, then prints its summary plus a \`git status --short\` of what changed, and cleans up its own scratch. Read that stdout — do NOT go looking for any temp/transcript files.`}
${liveDev && COLLECT_ROUNDS > 0 ? `5. PENDING — relay prints a report starting "Live ... still running after ...". ${engine.label} is NOT finished and has NOT failed: it is still writing the working tree, and the pane is still open. Do NOT retry, do NOT hand-write anything, and do NOT go to step 6 yet. Keep waiting instead: copy the \`relay ... collect --agent <name> --result <path>\` command the report prints, and run it — again ONE foreground Bash call with \`timeout: 600000\`, and the same WAIT RULE. It reattaches to that same pane and watches for another window. Run collect **at most ${COLLECT_ROUNDS} times in total** — the first collect is round 1, so after round ${COLLECT_ROUNDS} you stop. The moment any collect prints the delegate's result, continue at step 6 as a normal success. Only when round ${COLLECT_ROUNDS} still reports pending, go to step 5b.
5b. FAILURE PATH` : `5. FAILURE PATH`} — the command exits non-zero${liveDev ? `, or relay returns an empty/absent result${COLLECT_ROUNDS > 0 ? ', or the last allowed collect is still pending' : ', or relay prints a PENDING report ("still running after ... this is NOT a failure" — relay exits 0, but autopilot counts that delegate as NOT finished)'}` : `, or its output begins with "${engine.token}"`}. Then: do NOT hand-write the implementation yourself, and do NOT return early. Run steps 6 and 7 as usual, then return a summary whose FIRST word is FAILED, stating ${engine.label} was unreachable, failed, or timed out.${liveDev ? ' For a still-pending delegate, name the Agent from relay stdout in the step-7 log and note the pane was LEFT OPEN and is STILL WRITING the working tree.' : ''} Step 6 still runs on this path: the lint keeps the task file well-formed whatever ${engine.label} left behind, and the changed-file check is what tells the flightlog whether anything landed at all. The binary gate then fails this attempt; the loop moves to the next rung when one remains, or parks after the cap.
6. Lint the task file, then note what landed. The lint runs FIRST:
     bun ${S}/lint-task.ts ${path}
   The external engine edits files outside the harness, so the Edit/Write lint hook never saw its work — this call is the only structural check on the task file. A non-zero exit means the engine left the task file malformed (a decorated Status, a hand-ticked gate box, a sibling-task reference). Repair the header yourself until it lints clean: reset "> **Status**:" to a bare \`in-progress\`, and never hand-tick an Acceptance criteria or Verification box. Repair the HEADER only — never reword an Acceptance criteria or Verification item, even when lint names that item (a \`scope-git-status\` violation is a plan defect, not yours to edit). Rewriting a gate to make it pass is the same failure as ticking its box. Leave the violation standing and let the binary gate judge the work.
   Then establish only WHETHER work landed, not whether it is correct: read the changed-file list from the command's stdout, or run \`git status --short\` once if that stdout did not print one. Do NOT run the task's ## Verification commands, do NOT run the test suite, and do NOT edit a source file to make anything pass. An empty changed-file list means ${engine.label} produced nothing and belongs in your step-7 log and your summary. A non-empty one is all you report — the independent verifier downstream runs every command and owns the pass/fail verdict, including any red output you would have seen here.
7. Log a narrative note:
  bun ${S}/flightlog.ts log ${CFG.logFile} --task ${ref} --role dev --attempt ${attempt} --agent "dev-${engine.label}:${ref}#${attempt}" --phase end --message "<what ${engine.label} changed, or '${engine.label} unreachable'>"
Return a one-paragraph summary: what ${engine.label} implemented and which files changed.
${DEV_PLAN_DEFECT} Judge it from the task file and from what ${engine.label} reported, never by softening the instruction you wrote for it.`

//   - efficiency    : wasteful work, N+1s, redundant passes/allocations      ┘ lenses
// The external engine owns bugs (where cross-vendor diversity matters most); the

1. Read EVERY file in ${reviewDir(attempt)}/. If ${reviewEngine.label}.md is MISSING, is empty, or begins with "${reviewEngine.token}", call that out prominently — the cross-vendor pass did not run.
2. Apply the real fixes (you have Edit/Write). Use judgement: fix correctness / integration / regression issues from the cross-vendor lens, and the safe quality cleanups from the three Claude lenses (behaviour-preserving).

The independent binary gate already PASSED with this evidence:
${gateSummary}
Open the task file at ${path} and its ## Eval rubric. Score EACH dimension 0–scaleMax based on the real code and the verification evidence above — ground the correctness dimension in that evidence, not opinion.
Make a fresh scratch directory and use the path it prints as <dir> below. Never reuse a fixed path: another run may have left a file there.
  ${scratchDir('judge', ref, attempt)}
Write the scores JSON into it, then run score-task.ts to compute and persist the verdict:
  echo '<scores-json>' > <dir>/scores.json
Write your full rationale — the same prose you return — to <dir>/rationale.md using the Write tool, NOT a shell heredoc or echo: it is long markdown and shell quoting will mangle it. Run score-task.ts only after that Write succeeded:
  bun ${S}/score-task.ts ${path} <dir>/scores.json --json --log ${CFG.logFile} --attempt ${attempt} --agent "<your label>" --rationale-file <dir>/rationale.md
The rationale file is what puts your reasoning into the run's audit trail. Without it the trail keeps only a number, and a reader cannot tell why the task passed.
If the command exits 1, that is a valid rubric failure; still return the printed JSON verdict. Return the CLI's printed verdict object VERBATIM as "verdict", plus your scores and rationale.
Finally, record completion: bun ${S}/flightlog.ts log ${CFG.logFile} --task ${ref} --role judge --attempt ${attempt} --agent "<your label>" --phase end --message "<weighted score>"

// ── Structured-output resilience ────────────────────────────────────────────
// A schema'd `agent()` fails two ways. It resolves to `null` on a terminal API
// failure — that is what every `if (!gate)` guard below tests for. And it
// REJECTS when the subagent writes its payload as message text instead of
// calling the StructuredOutput tool. The harness nudges once and gives up, so
// the throw is what reaches us.
//
// Catching that throw is not the same as recovering from it: by then the agent
// has usually done all of the real work, and parking it would discard that.
//
// So retry once, and only once. What makes a second run cost time and nothing
// else is that every call wrapped here is IDEMPOTENT: `verify` and `reverify`
// only read, `mark-done.ts` validates the header before it writes anything, the
// park is an idempotent edit, and the scout runs one read-only command. The
// retry replaces both model and effort so the failed call cannot leak its choice.
//
// Two callers are deliberately NOT wrapped, both for the same reason — they
// persist something before they return, so a second run is not free:
//   - the commit agents, where a retry after a partial commit writes a second,
//     incoherent commit. They keep `settled()`: report, never re-run.
//   - the rubric judge, which appends a verdict row via `score-task.ts --log`.
//     See the call site.
// A wrapped call may still duplicate its narrative flightlog rows. That is the
// accepted cost: the retry genuinely happened, so a trail showing both attempts
// is truthful. Duplicating a persisted VERDICT is not, which is where the line sits.

//   INFRASTRUCTURE — nothing was judged at all: an agent returned no structured
//                    result, or the pipeline threw. Retrying dev would burn a
//                    second attempt on top of an unknown state, so the task is
//                    escalated immediately; only unlanded tasks are parked.

   Do not run the task's Verification commands and do not judge the result: an independent verifier checks the landed main tree after you.
   If you cannot resolve a file with confidence, run ${note('end', 'CONFLICT — unresolved: <files>')} and return step 1's JSON with resolved: false. A person resolves it instead; a guessed merge that lands is worse.

## What the main agent does with the result

- `aborted` — `null` or the first `{ reason, paths }` that stopped the run. Report the cause and leak paths. Inspect the retained worktrees before resuming; the run performed no further commits or end sweep after this abort.
- `completed` — tasks that passed their rubric **and** whose `mark-done` transition was confirmed, this invocation only. It includes the Final review task, if the run finished cleanly. It is not a tree-completion count; see the note on `counts.done` below.
- `escalations` — `[{ task, attempt, infrastructure, parked, reason }]`. For each one, surface it to the user. In a cockpit session, use `needs_your_call` + `cockpit wait`. Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion`. Include the last `reason` — the judge rationale, the gate output, or the infrastructure cause. `infrastructure: true` identifies a pipeline or mechanical failure; report the cause rather than claiming the work was rejected. When the cause says "landed, but Status was not marked done", tell the user to run `mark-done.ts` by hand before another run. `parked: false` means the task was NOT confirmed as `blocked`; report its Status as unknown and follow the escalation's recovery instruction.
- `needsHuman` — `[{ task, criteria }]`, the `(human)` gate items that passed with no machine check and no attestation. Report it **separately from `escalations`**: those tasks are genuinely `done`, nothing is parked, and nothing needs a Status reset. Print the criteria verbatim as the user's closing checklist, and say that `mark-done.ts` ticked their boxes like any other, so the task file no longer shows the check is outstanding.
- `worktrees` — report the sorted `{ ref, path }` union of live worktrees and blocked leftovers retained from the start sweep. If a scout failed, preserve the returned worktree list without filtering it further.
- `drained` — ready tasks left `todo` because `<planDir>/.flightlog/drain` existed at their dispatch. Report them as not started, not as failures. Tell the user to delete the drain file before the next run.
- `cleanupFailures` — report landed worktrees whose removal could not be confirmed, separately from kept worktrees. A removal failure alone leaves the task completed, with no escalation.
- A task ref appears in exactly one of `completed`, `escalations`, and `drained`. A ref in `needsHuman` is always also in `completed`.
- Then render the trail. Run `bun <scriptsDir>/flightlog.ts report <logFile>` → `RUNLOG.md`.
- **Resume**: after the user unblocks a parked task, follow `SKILL.md` → "Escalation — park & continue, then resume".

## Notes / gotchas

### Run-wide abort and kept-worktree resume

Preserve unlanded work when a main-tree leak aborts the run. Resume each non-final task in its kept worktree against a fresh fingerprint baseline.

- Keep one script-level `aborted` state, initially `null`, holding `{ reason, paths }` after the first cause. When a land returns `leak`, record the observing ref in the reason and retain its returned paths. Preserve the first cause if another check subsequently fails.
- After each wave's `parallel(...)` resolves, run `wt-leak:<wave>` under the main-tree lock before any other wave-loop action, including the no-progress exit and either commit site. Compare against the last recorded fingerprint with `fingerprint --expect`. Run this check even when no task passed. When paths are non-empty, abort the run. When the check returns no structured result after its retry, abort with reason `wave-end leak check returned no result` and empty paths.
- Use one abort-check helper inside the acquired `Max parallel` slot before the task body, at every attempt's start, and under the main-tree lock immediately before each land. When a task observes the abort, return an infrastructure failure with reason `run aborted: <abort reason>`. Leave its Status untouched, invoke no `block:` agent, and retain its unlanded worktree in `live` and on disk.
- After a clean land, finish `done:` and `wt-remove:` even if another task aborts the run in the meantime. Remove that landed task from `live` after confirmed cleanup. Preserve the existing separate reporting of cleanup failures.
- After the current wave resolves with an abort, stop scouting and skip all remaining commits and `wt-sweep:end`. Return `aborted` with the sorted `worktrees` union of entries still in `live` and still-blocked leftovers retained by the start sweep.
- When a wave runs Final review, skip its wave-end leak check and make no later fingerprint comparison against the main tree it intentionally changes. Keep the normal run's startup baseline. When resuming Final review from `dev`, `verify`, or `judge`, use the main tree without a resume baseline, `wt-show`, or `wt-create`.
- When resuming a non-final task, first take the main-tree lock and record `fingerprint` without `--expect`, labelled `wt-leak:resume`. Use that fresh baseline for subsequent land expectations. Then run the existing `wt-show:<ref>` under the same main-tree lock discipline before any task agent.
- When resuming from `verify` or `judge`, reuse the existing worktree reported by `wt-show`, add its path to `live`, and pass that path as `WORKTREE` to every resumed step. If it is missing, halt with an infrastructure failure naming the path and instructing a resume from `dev`; never recreate the only copy of the work being resumed. When starting at `judge`, continue reading `CFG.attestationFile`.
- When resuming from `dev`, reuse the worktree if `wt-show` reports it exists. Only when it is missing, create a fresh worktree under the lock. After a clean land, remove the resumed worktree; when the task parks, retain it. Run neither a scout nor a wave loop for a single-task resume.

### Existing behavior and rationale

- **Wave re-scout is non-negotiable.** Statuses change only inside the run. The orchestrator must recompute the ready set each wave. A task unblocked by a wave-N completion is picked up in wave N+1.
- **The scout TRANSCRIBES.** It runs one command and hands back exactly what the command printed (`stdout`, `exitCode`, `stderr`). The script does every interpretation. Nothing the agent returns requires it to understand the tree. The script parses and validates the summary before deriving `{ready, counts, unfinished, invalidRefs, parseErrors}`. Note `--summary` prints its JSON **before** exiting non-zero on a malformed tree, so a non-zero exit alone is not a scout failure.
- **The scout copies `maxParallel` out of the blob as its own structured field, because a verbatim transcription drops the trailing `null` key.** The script reads the cap from `SCOUT_SCHEMA.maxParallel` (`integer | null`, required), checks it against stdout only when stdout still carries the key, and treats a disagreement as a `(scout)` failure. **Residual:** a scout that drops the key from stdout *and* invents `null` for the structured field still runs a capped plan uncapped; no check here catches two coordinated errors.

- **`completed.length` is not a completion count. `counts.done` is.** The wave loop's `completed` array only holds tasks *this invocation* finished. A resumed run inherits `done` tasks from earlier runs, so comparing `completed.length` with the tree size reports a false stall on every resume. The scout's `counts.done === counts.total` counts the tree on disk, which is the only place completion actually lives. The loop also asserts `total === todo + inProgress + done + blocked + invalid` before trusting any bucket.

- **Every terminal condition is explicit.** `done === total` is clean completion. A scout that throws or returns malformed output is a `(scout)` failure, and a failed start sweep or baseline is a `(worktree)` failure. A main-tree leak aborts the run after the current wave. A non-empty `errors` is a tree failure. `invalid > 0` is a tree failure naming the invalid refs. A counts mismatch is a scout failure. A readable but empty tasks directory, where every count is zero, escalates as `(tree)` before the `done === total` completion test. A ref that is in `completed` *and* still unfinished on disk is a **divergence**, escalated as `(divergence)` before the ready set is filtered. An empty ready set with unfinished tasks is a **stall**, escalated with the counts plus every remaining `ref (state)`. A configured budget floor stops the loop between the inter-wave commit and dispatch when the remaining output-token balance is below that floor. A wave where no task passed stops the loop, because nothing new can unblock. Only the first ends the run cleanly. A commit failure is not a terminal condition: it escalates as synthetic task `(commit)` and does **not** block later commits — the work stays in the tree, so the next wave's commit sweeps it up.

- **Divergence is a set intersection, never a count comparison.** `completed` is memory, the scout's `unfinished` is disk, and a ref in both means a task file was rewritten after its `mark-done` was confirmed. The tempting check is `completed.length > counts.done`, and it is wrong: a resumed run inherits `done` tasks from earlier runs, so `counts.done` already exceeds `completed.length` and the inequality never fires — silent on precisely the runs where a rollback is hardest to see. The intersection holds on fresh and resumed runs alike, and it *is* the ref list the escalation has to print. It must run **before** the `fresh` filter, because that filter drops already-completed refs: after it, the diverged task is neither re-dispatched nor reported, and the run dies waves later as a generic `(tree)` stall blaming the wrong thing.

- **`counts` describes what parsed, not the tree.** A file that fails to parse — no H1, a duplicate `bucket/NN` — never enters `byRef`, so it never enters `counts`. Delete four broken files from a five-task tree and `counts` reads `{total: 1, done: 1}`: `done === total` holds, and the run reports clean completion over a tree it could not read. That is why the loop validates and checks the parsed `errors` array **before** the completion test instead of asking the scout to understand it.

- **The stall check excludes tasks this run already parked.** Every parked task carries its own escalation, and the very next wave necessarily sees it as unfinished-and-not-ready. Counting it again would append a phantom `(tree)` stall to every run that parked anything, so the run would report two problems where there is one. When the only unfinished tasks are ones already escalated, the loop just breaks.

- **The script has a deterministic fixture.** `scripts/orchestrator-script.test.ts` extracts this exact fenced block, runs it with stubbed `agent`/`parallel`, and asserts the termination rules, the quality-vs-infrastructure split, and the "every task lands in `completed` XOR `escalations`" invariant. No agent is spawned. **Edit the block and run `bun test packages/dispatch/skills/autopilot/scripts/orchestrator-script.test.ts`** — a syntax error or a broken loop shows up there instead of mid-flight.

- **Quality failures retry; infrastructure failures escalate immediately.** A verifier returning `passed: false` judged real work and found it wanting — that feeds the dev loop another attempt. A verifier or judge returning *no structured result* judged nothing at all, so retrying dev would stack a second attempt on an unknown state. Apply the same rule to a thrown pipeline before land. Park unlanded tasks and report the specific failure. After a clean land, never park or unland: a failed `mark-done` escalates with "landed, but Status was not marked done", and removal still runs. If removal cannot be confirmed, probe with `wt-show` and report the path in `cleanupFailures` when it still exists or the probe fails. The attempt number is reported as it actually was — compute was consumed, and claiming otherwise would mislead the audit. **The harness exposes no original cause for a null agent result**; the escalation says so rather than inventing an error message.

- **Both status transitions are confirmed by a reread, not by the agent's word.** `markDonePrompt` and `markBlockedPrompt` each return `{ ok, status, error }` and each must reopen the file and read the Status line back. An agent can return a fluent summary having edited nothing, and for parking that is the *likely* case — the task is often being parked because its header was malformed to begin with. An unconfirmed park reported as success is worse than a failed one: the file still reads `in-progress`, `next-ready` never re-offers it, and the `parked: false` signal that tells the user to reset it by hand never fires.

- **A schema'd `agent()` throws as well as returning `null` — guard for both.** `agent(prompt, {schema})` resolves to `null` on a terminal API failure, and that is what every `if (!gate)` / `if (!judged)` / `if (!committed)` guard tests. But it **rejects** when the subagent never calls the StructuredOutput tool — typically because it text-emitted `<StructuredOutput>…</StructuredOutput>` as a message instead. A null-guard can never see a throw. Inside a task that is already handled: `runTaskGuarded` catches around the whole pipeline. The two calls that sit *outside* it — the wave-loop scout and both commit agents — are wrapped in `settled()`, which turns either failure into the same reportable shape. Do not remove those wrappers. An unguarded throw at the top of the wave loop discards `completed` and `escalations` for every wave that already finished, so the run returns nothing while the tree on disk reads `done` — the work happened and no one is told.

- **Catching that throw is not recovering from it — `resilient()` retries once.** By the time a schema'd call rejects, the agent has usually done all of the real work, so every schema'd call whose re-run is free of side effects retries exactly once on `MODEL.structuredRetry`; the comment above `resilient` lists which calls qualify and why. **The commit agents and the rubric judge are excluded** because each persists something before it returns: a second commit after a partial one, or a second verdict row that `fleet.ts` ignores while the orchestrator acts on it. A retry is not a loop — the second throw propagates, so a stuck agent still parks. `RETURN_CONTRACT` is the cheap companion: the schema is invisible to the agent, so one explicit sentence says *how* to return. Every schema'd prompt carries it.
- **Wrap the task thunk; reconcile by index; never `.filter(Boolean)`.** `parallel()` resolves a thrown thunk to `null`, and a `null` carries neither the task ref nor the cause. `runTaskGuarded` catches around `executeTask` so both survive, and it still attempts `markBlockedPrompt` and records whether the park worked. The wave then reconciles `results[i]` against `fresh[i]`, so even a `null` lands on its own task instead of vanishing. Filtering first would drop the task from `completed` and `escalations` both, and an unparked task stays `in-progress` — which `next-ready` never offers again.
- **There is exactly one scoring implementation.** The judge agent runs `score-task.ts --json --log` with its scores. The orchestrator gates on that printed verdict object. If the formula changes, change `score-task.ts`. Do NOT duplicate the arithmetic in the orchestrator.
- **The judge's rationale reaches the trail through a file, or not at all.** A failed attempt's rationale travels through `rejectionOf()` into the retry and the park reason; a *passing* one would otherwise live only in orchestrator memory, leaving `RUNLOG.md` a number with no evidence. So the judge writes it to `rationale.md` in a fresh `mktemp -d` directory under `/tmp/q-lab/dispatch/autopilot/<project>/<slug>/` and passes `--rationale-file`. **Never a fixed path**: the Write tool refuses to overwrite a file it has not read, so a leftover from another run becomes this attempt's score row; only the `mktemp` leaf is collision-free. **A file, not a `--rationale` argument**: a rationale runs to hundreds of words of markdown with quotes, backticks, and newlines, and the judge composes the command itself — shell quoting would mangle it. For the same reason the prompt names the **Write tool** rather than `echo` or a heredoc. `--rationale-file` never fails the run: the verdict is already computed when it is read, and the judge is one of the two calls `resilient()` deliberately does not retry, so an unreadable file warns on stderr and logs the verdict without it rather than parking a task that passed.
- **`CFG.budgetFloor` defaults to `0` (off).** `budget.total` is `null` unless the user declares a target, so enabling a floor by default would manufacture a surprise stall class for existing runs. When configured above zero, it stops dispatching a ready wave when the remaining output-token balance falls below the floor.
- **Final review needs no special phase.** Its transitive `Depends on` reaches every task. So `next-ready` offers it only once everything else is `done`. When the `finalReview` flag is set, the orchestrator runs `runFinalReview` instead of a single dev agent — the multi-lens fan-out described below. It also uses the smaller `FINAL_MAX` cap. The binary gate, the rubric judge, and the score gate stay unchanged. They evaluate the round's output against the Final review task's own `## Eval rubric`: integration, consistency, no regressions, and whether it meets the PLAN goal.
- **The *orchestrator* runs the review fan-out, not one agent.** A Workflow agent has `Skill` and `Bash`, so the external CLI is reachable. But it has **no `Agent` tool**. So it cannot spawn fan-out skills like `/simplify` or `/code-review` itself. The orchestrator sidesteps that. `runFinalReview` issues one `agent()` per lens via `parallel()`. One lens is the cross-vendor lens (`CFG.reviewEngine`: codex or opencode), driven through the `<engine>-run.ts review` wrapper over Bash. The other three are quality lenses — reuse, leanness, efficiency — and each runs on Claude. Every reviewer writes findings to `.flightlog/review/attempt-N/<lens>.md` and edits nothing. A single **fixer** (`choices.fix`: `MODEL.fix` unless the task's `Models` header overrides it) then reads all the files and applies the changes. The external engine gives the deliberate cross-*vendor* signal that an all-Claude dev+judge cannot produce. If it is unreachable, that reviewer writes its `<ENGINE> UNREACHABLE` token instead. The fixer then flags this, and the gate fails the task rather than pass an un-reviewed deliverable. Codex review is sandbox-enforced read-only. Opencode review is prompt-enforced read-only instead — its wrapper prepends a hard "analyze only" guard.
- **One lens per direction: `reuse` may add code, `leanness` may only cut.** The fixer reads every findings file in one pass with no arbitration rule, so a lens that argues with itself is a lens the fixer has to guess about. On the abstraction axis `reuse` is the only lens that may ask for more code, and `leanness` only asks for less; where both land on one span, the fixer prompt calls it a trade-off to settle. `leanness` also covers what `reuse` cannot see — hand-rolled stdlib and dependencies doing what the runtime ships (`stdlib:` / `native:`). Its tag-plus-replacement output contract, adapted from the [ponytail-review](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) skill, makes the lens commit to a location, a cut, and a substitute instead of hedging. **Scope the "only reuse may add code" rule to the abstraction axis**: `efficiency` routinely proposes a cache, a batch, or an index, and a blanket "every other lens only cuts" would let the fixer reject a valid perf fix for adding lines.
- **`CFG.liveReviewEngine` puts that cross-vendor lens in a visible herdr pane.** It is gated on `CFG.relayPath` alone, deliberately **not** on `liveDevEngine` or on `devEngine`: the review lens is external on every flight, including an all-Claude one, so tying it to the dev engine would make the most common flight the one that can never watch its own review. The lens agent then runs `relay <engine> review --git-scope none --wait-timeout 480000` instead of the `<engine>-run.ts review` wrapper, and the same 480s-inside-600s pairing and `relay collect` pending rounds apply for the same reasons they do on the dev path. It passes `--dangerous` like the dev delegate, and that is the deliberate call: a live pane has no sandbox flag of its own, so an approval prompt nobody is watching stalls the lens until the wait and every collect round expire — roughly half an hour, ending in a false `UNREACHABLE` on a review that was never actually blocked. Autopilot runs semi-unattended, so a stall costs more than the risk it buys back. Read-only stays prompt-enforced from two directions (relay's REVIEW_CONTRACT and the lens prompt's own "record, never edit"), and a reviewer that edits anyway surfaces downstream: the fixer re-runs the task's verification, and the binary gate grades the result. A pending review that never lands is written as the `<ENGINE> UNREACHABLE` token, exactly like a non-zero exit — the fixer must fail the task rather than pass an un-reviewed deliverable, so "still running" cannot quietly become "no findings". The three Claude quality lenses are unaffected; they are Claude agents with no CLI to place in a pane.
- **The fixer is not the judge.** The reviewers and the fixer form the "dev" side of the Final review. The binary gate and the rubric judge stay independent. So the dev≠judge anti-self-grading split still holds, even though this round is more elaborate.
- **`CFG.devEngine: 'codex'` (or `'opencode'`) hands the dev step to that CLI.** The default is `'claude'` (`MODEL.dev`, then `MODEL.devLast` on the last Claude rung). `CFG.lastShotEngine` defaults to `''` (off); on a Claude ladder, setting it to `'codex'` or `'opencode'` appends one external attempt after the Opus rung without replacing Opus. It is ignored when `devEngine` is already external, because that ladder already ends on Claude-Opus. When `devEngine` is set to an external engine, each non-finalReview task's dev step becomes a *driver* on `MODEL.devExternal`. That driver runs the `<engine>-run.ts delegate` wrapper — the same wrapper the cross-vendor review lens uses, reachable from a Workflow agent's Bash. So the external CLI writes the implementation. If `CFG.liveDevEngine` is true and `CFG.relayPath` resolved under `HERDR_ENV=1`, the driver instead runs the same delegate through relay in a visible herdr live pane. Otherwise it uses the headless wrapper. The verify → judge → score pipeline stays Claude. This *strengthens* the dev≠judge split into a cross-vendor one: the external CLI writes, and Claude-Opus judges. An external-engine ladder's last attempt before the cap still falls back to Claude-Opus, so a task the external engine cannot clear gets one strong Claude try before parking — **except at `maxAttempts: 1`**, where the `last > first` guard keeps that single attempt on the external engine rather than skipping it entirely, and there is no Claude fallback. A Claude ladder can instead end on the configured `lastShotEngine` after its Opus rung. If the CLI is unreachable, or relay returns no result, the driver never fabricates. The binary gate fails that attempt, and the loop reaches the next rung. The live path passes `--wait-timeout 480000` (8 min), and the driver is told to make ONE foreground Bash call with `timeout: 600000`. **That pairing is load-bearing: the wait must expire inside the Bash tool's 600s hard cap — with margin.** The margin is not optional: relay's poll clock starts *after* it spawns the pane and waits up to `SPAWN_IDLE_WAIT_MS` (20s) for the TUI to settle, so the Bash call's wall time is that setup plus the wait plus cleanup. 480s leaves roughly 90s of slack; 540s did not. A command that outruns the cap is moved to the background, and a driver left to invent its own wait writes a `jobs`-based poll loop that can never work — every Bash call gets a fresh shell where `jobs` sees nothing — and burns the full 600s after the delegate has finished. So the driver prompt bans `run_in_background` and shell poll loops outright, and the wait is bounded below the cap so the one call returns on its own. Relay's poll loop returns the instant the result lands, so the budget costs nothing for normal-speed tasks. **A `pending` outcome is not a failure and must not be treated as one.** Relay checks the pane's status before reporting it: an agent that has settled without a verified result is reported as a real failure instead, so `pending` specifically means the delegate is *still working* — and still writing the working tree, with its pane still open. Failing the attempt there would start a second writer on the same files. So the driver keeps waiting instead: `CFG.liveCollectRounds` (default 3) more `relay collect` calls, each reattaching to that same pane for another 8-minute window. A task can therefore run ~32 min while every individual Bash call still returns inside the 600s cap. Only when the last allowed collect is still pending does the attempt fail. Do not wait indefinitely, and do not use `herd wait` for this — it blocks until `idle`, and codex parks at `done`, so it can miss a finished delegate entirely; `collect` reuses relay's own `idle`-or-`done`-plus-marker test. `devEngine` and `reviewEngine` are independent. You can have opencode write and codex review, or the reverse. Only the dev step changes. finalReview's multi-lens round, and everything else, stay untouched.

- **The external dev driver does not run the task's Verification commands; the Claude dev prompt still does.** That asymmetry is deliberate, not a missed edit. A Claude dev is the author: it holds Edit/Write, and a red result in its own turn is a self-correction that saves an attempt before the gate ever sees it. The driver holds no such lever — it may not hand-write the implementation (instruction shape (a)), and re-delegating is not a step it is given, so its verification could only ever be a report. And nothing reads that report: the dev step is `await agent(...)` with no assignment and no schema, and retry feedback is built by `renderHistory(attempts)` from the gate and judge verdicts, never from the dev's returned prose. A driver run would only repeat the independent verifier's work on wall clock, and it would put a model in front of red output it has no sanctioned response to — the pressure behind the destructive-git failures described below. **Step 6 keeps two checks that are not duplicated work.** `lint-task.ts` is the only structural check the task file gets — the external engine writes outside the harness, so the Edit/Write lint hook never sees it, and the verify agent does not lint. The changed-file list separates "the engine produced nothing" from "the engine produced something wrong"; the headless wrapper already prints a `git status --short`, so on that path it costs no command.
- **The destructive-git ban belongs to every prompt that lets its agent choose what to run, not only to the prompts whose agents write source code.** Every Workflow agent has Bash, so the boundary is command discretion, not role: dev, driver, fixer, verifier, judge, review lenses, commit agents, and the land agent carry `NO_RESTORE_RULE`, while `mark-done`, `mark-blocked`, the scout, and the other `worktree.ts` calls run one scripted command and do not. The commit agents are included because their instructions anticipate blocking hooks and merge conflicts, exactly the pressure under which an agent reaches for `reset` to tidy the tree. A verifier that sees red output it did not create — a sibling's in-progress edits — and has no sanctioned response will try `git reset --hard`; one did. This is defense-in-depth, not enforcement: Workflow `agent()` accepts no tool allowlist, and a before/after tree comparison detects damage only after it is unrecoverable, so the prompt is the only lever the script has. Keep dev, verify, and judge in the same task worktree so the verifier sees the uncommitted edits it must verify.

- **Only the commit agents commit — every other writer leaves its work unstaged.** `NO_COMMIT_RULE` goes into the Claude dev prompt, the external dev driver's prompt *and* the instruction that driver writes for its CLI, and the final-review fixer's prompt. It is one shared constant so the three writers cannot drift apart. Two things break when a task commits itself. The wave stops being one atomic commit — the inter-wave commit agent finds a partially committed tree and writes a second, incoherent commit for the remainder. And in a parallel wave, whatever the committing task stages sweeps up a sibling task's half-finished edits, so a commit message describes work its diff does not contain and a later revert takes an unrelated task with it. The external engines need the ban twice over: `codex` and `opencode` write the tree outside the harness, where no hook can stop them, and both are trained to finish a job by committing it.

- **The external driver's instruction file is shape-constrained, but it still restates the no-commit ban in its own words.** Step 3 forbids three things in the file it writes for the CLI: implementation code the driver authored, a softened gate, and a claim that existing work is already correct. Retry feedback is bounded the same way — it may add requirements, never subtract a verification command or excuse the rejected attempt. Ready-to-paste code reduces a cross-*vendor* dev step to transcribing a Claude solution, which throws away the only reason to run an external engine; a softened gate is the instruction-file route around `lint-task.ts`'s `scope-git-status` rule, which says such a gate is a plan defect to leave standing.

- **The paraphrase of the ban is a known, accepted hole.** The same run restated `NO_COMMIT_RULE` as `Do NOT commit. Leave all changes staged but uncommitted.` plus a `### Step 9: Stage All Changes` — the inverse of a rule that bans `git add` outright. Ordering the block pasted verbatim closes it, and that was tried and deliberately reverted: some real verification commands (`git diff --exit-code <generated-file>`, or a `bin/ci` wrapper around one) only pass against a staged tree, and a hard verbatim ban parks those tasks with no escape. The three shapes differ: `git diff --exit-code` passes once staged (and staging defeats its intent, since it exists to prove the *committed* file matches the code), a `git status --porcelain` emptiness check does not pass, and a wrapper script is opaque to inspection. `scope-git-status` matches only `git status`, so the first and third shapes reach the driver unflagged.

  The rule bans the *restore* family — `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git clean` — in its own sentence, because the "any other command that changes git state" clause genuinely does not reach them: they rewrite the working tree and leave refs and the index alone, so a careful reader concludes they are permitted — and a driver that did ran `git checkout` over a *parallel* task's file, reverting a confirmed `Status: done` to `todo`. The rule also separates the two prohibitions on purpose: editing a source file a sibling also edits is legitimate and common — that is what a parallel wave *is* — so the ban is narrowed to other tasks' files under `tasks/`. A blanket "don't touch files that aren't yours" would forbid the shared-file edits the plan itself schedules.
- **Commits use inline git, not the atomic-commit skill — the same `no Agent tool` constraint applies.** The inter-wave and post-loop commits must NOT invoke `odin-git:atomic-commit`. That skill spawns the vör + bragi sub-agents, and a Workflow agent cannot do that. Its analysis script also lives in a *different* plugin's cache, which the agent cannot resolve — there is no `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in agent Bash. The `commitInstructions` builder inlines the skill's whole contract instead: the matched flightlog lifecycle, the atomic grouping principles, plus the exact commit-message template (emoji/type subject, English body, `---`, zh-TW summary). So each labeled agent commits over plain git, self-contained. If the commit convention changes, edit the template in that one builder.
- **Concurrency** is capped by the Workflow runtime (`min(16, cores-2)`). Passing a wide wave is safe — excess tasks queue.
- **A plan caps its own concurrency with `> **Max parallel**: N` in PLAN.md, and the scout carries it.** `next-ready.ts --summary` parses the header into `maxParallel` (`null` when absent or `unlimited`), and the wave loop hands each task a slot from `makeSlots`. **The slot spans the whole pipeline — dev, verify, judge, mark-done, park — not only the writer windows**, because a verifier's build or live check needs the shared resource while a sibling's delegate is reinstalling it, and the verifier is not a writer. A slot needs no prompt at all, where a lock rule pasted into prompts reaches an external delegate only if the driver copies it. **The cap is read off disk every wave, never baked into `CFG`**: a baked copy is one more value the main agent must remember to transcribe, and a missed transcription is the same silent parallel run. For the same reason a scout whose structured `maxParallel` is missing is a `(scout)` failure rather than "no cap", and a malformed header is a parse error in `errors`. **Residual:** a scout that drops `modelsRaw` from stdout and also invents `null` in `readyModels` silently selects defaults; these two coordinated errors can evade the same cross-check used for `maxParallel`. **Serial prose is only an advisory.** `lint-task.ts <tasks-dir>` prints `[serial-undeclared]` when PLAN.md or `_context/*.md` asks for serial execution or a lock without the header; it is not a violation because the matching wording in real plans (2 of ~20 measured) was already enforced by `Depends on` edges.
- **A single-task resume replaces the wave loop, and gets a whole fresh cap.** `CFG.resumeTask` runs one `executeTask` and no scout: there is no tree to read, and the ref, path and `finalReview` flag come from `CFG` because nothing downstream re-derives them. `CFG.resumeAttempt` only moves where the numbering *starts* — the task still gets `maxAttempts` (or `finalReviewMaxAttempts`) rungs, because a resume is a fresh flight for that task and the number exists so the flightlog and the `score-task.ts --log` verdict rows keep rising instead of colliding with the parked run's. **That is why every rung is keyed off `last` (`first + cap - 1`) and never off `cap`.** Two things break otherwise, both silently. `for (let attempt = 3; attempt <= FINAL_MAX; …)` is false on entry, so the loop body never runs and the task is re-parked having executed nothing — which reads exactly like "it tried again and still failed". And `attempt >= claudeCap` is already true on the first rung, so a resumed Claude ladder raises effort immediately instead of reserving the increase for its last Claude rung. With `first` at 1 the two are equal.

- **`CFG.resumeFrom` skips steps on the resumed attempt only.** `startAt` is `RESUME.from` when `attempt === first`, and `'dev'` on every later attempt. So a resumed attempt that fails its gate runs the *whole* pipeline next time, including the Final review's four-lens round. That is the right default and not a missed optimisation: a red verify says the work below it genuinely does need redoing, and the alternative — a task looping forever on a verifier re-reading the same unchanged tree — is worse than paying for the round. `'judge'` synthesises `gate` rather than skipping it, because `gate.summary` is read downstream by the judge prompt and by `rejectionOf`; a skipped gate would hand both of them `undefined`.

- **Skipping the binary gate requires a signed artifact, and the attestation is scoped to the items it names.** `resumeFrom: 'judge'` throws at script start without `CFG.attestationFile`. The alternative was a free-text `--evidence` string, and it was rejected: once *any* wording can stand in for the gate, every red task can be passed by asserting a person checked it, and no later reader can tell an honest attestation from a convenient one. So the file must name **which gate items** were performed, quoting each as the task file writes it; the verifier is told to reject an entry that is not an item of that task, and never to treat the attestation as ranking above a command. The residual is honest and unclosable from inside the script: a person who signs for a check they did not perform gets the pass, and all the design buys is that the claim is specific, on disk, and attributable. `resumeFrom: 'verify'` needs no attestation — it runs the real gate and only adds evidence.

- **A `(human)` gate item is declared by the plan, skipped by the verifier, and reported at the end of the run.** The tag sits at the head of a gate item (`- [ ] (human) …`) and means no command can perform it — a pointer sweep, a hardware toggle, a click on a menu-bar app. Without the tag such an item guarantees a park on correct work, because the verifier can only fail it. The verifier leaves it alone, returns it in `humanPending`, and the task passes on its machine-checkable half; the orchestrator collects those into `needsHuman` and the main agent prints them as a closing checklist. Three rules keep that from becoming a pass key. The **plan author** declares the tag, with the same authority that wrote the criterion — a verifier may never add one, and an item it merely finds hard to run must be left to fail, because an uncheckable item is a plan defect. **`lint-task.ts`'s `human-gate` rule refuses a gate section whose items are all tagged**, so a tagged plan always leaves the verifier real work; that rule is what stops the tag from hollowing out the binary gate one item at a time. And `humanPending` is taken from the **passing** gate only — a failed attempt is retried, and its verifier re-derives the same list, so carrying a rejected attempt's list forward would report every item twice. **Known residual:** `mark-done.ts` ticks a `(human)` box like any other, so the task file alone cannot tell you a person still owes a check. `RUNLOG.md` and the run result are where that lives, which is why the verifier's flightlog message ends with `NEEDS HUMAN: <n> item(s)`.

- **Do NOT give the dev agent `isolation: 'worktree'`.** Avoid `agent({isolation: 'worktree'})`: it isolates one agent call and never merges back. Let the orchestrator own one worktree per task across dev → verify → judge, with mechanical agents creating and landing it through `worktree.ts`. Admit a judged pass into the main tree only through a three-way land under the main-tree lock.

- **The land agent resolves a land conflict itself, and a conflict never costs an attempt.** The work already passed its judge; charging an attempt for a conflict parked `channel/01` twice at 4.86 and 4.71 over `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `src/main.rs`. So the land runs on `MODEL.land` (opus/low), not the relaying `MODEL.worktree`. On `conflict` it keeps the main-tree lock, runs `rebase --op a<N>-land-rebase`, resolves the markers inside the task worktree (a lockfile is regenerated by its package manager, never hand-merged), and lands again with `--op a<N>-reland`. Nothing else can land meanwhile, so that second land is clean. It returns `resolved: true`, which forces the separate `reverify` exactly as drift does: the resolver never verifies its own resolution. A reverify failure still unlands, rebases with `a<N>-rebase`, and costs the attempt. When the agent cannot resolve a file with confidence it returns the conflict, and the task parks as an infrastructure escalation with the worktree kept; no further dev attempt is spent. Allow conflicting edits within a wave without a `Depends on` edge.

- **A land retry resets the worktree before it replays.** `resilient` re-runs the whole land agent, and the recorded `land` and `rebase` ops replay as no-ops, so a half-finished resolution would otherwise be the retry's starting point. The retry prompt therefore first runs `worktree.ts reset <ref> --op a<N>-land-rebase`, which restores the tree that rebase recorded, or prints `{"reset":false}` when the rebase never ran. **Residual:** a retry after a successful reland also resets the worktree to its marker state; the main tree already holds the resolved land, so this matters only when the following reverify fails and the next dev attempt starts from those markers.

- **Every land writes a `land` flightlog row whose message starts `CLEAN`, `CONFLICT`, or `LEAK`.** `flightlog.ts progress` reads it: a last attempt whose land ended on `CONFLICT` resumes `--from dev`, because the worktree holds markers or a partial resolution that only a dev step can finish.

- **Use a land op id per attempt.** The next attempt's land must act instead of replaying an old result.

- **A plan defect parks at once.** A dev reply whose first line is `PLAN DEFECT: <why>`, or a verifier returning a non-empty `planDefect`, parks the task with that text as the reason and starts no further attempt. `contract/03` otherwise spent three attempts on a `pgrep -f` gate that matched live sessions. The dev reports it as a text line rather than through a schema, because the dev step has no schema: adding one would turn a dev that writes its payload as text into a thrown pipeline that parks finished work.

- **`<planDir>/.flightlog/drain` stops dispatch without stopping the run.** The scout reports whether it exists, and every non-resume `wt-create` runs behind `test -e <drain>`, so a task queued for a slot inside a wave is caught too. A drained task stays `todo` with no worktree and lands in `drained`, never in `escalations`. In-flight tasks finish and land, the wave loop stops, and the post-loop commit runs as usual. The file is never deleted by the run.

- **Hold the main-tree lock around every `worktree.ts` call.** Prevent an unlocked create from snapshotting half a land and two unlocked state rewrites from losing an entry. Stop the run with its cause if a sweep or baseline fails twice; no task owns that failure.

- **Throw on a null worktree result inside the `make` passed to `resilient`.** Trigger its single retry, which otherwise runs only on a throw. Repeat the identical command, including `--expect` and `--op`; replaying a recorded `--op` in `worktree.ts` makes a land retry safe.

- **Re-verify a clean land with drift before marking the task done.** Hold the main-tree lock and the task slot while `reverify` runs Verification in the repo root with the task's verify model and effort. Record the new fingerprint only after a pass. On failure, run `unland` and `rebase` under the same lock with attempt-specific op ids, then feed `REVERIFY FAIL` and the summary to the next dev attempt. Keep the worktree when the attempt cap parks the task.

- **Retry a null drift re-verify once by throwing inside `resilient`'s `make`.** Repeat the same prompt on the structured retry model. If neither call returns a structured result, unland under the lock, then park as an infrastructure failure without rebasing or starting another attempt. Keep the worktree and the previous main fingerprint.
