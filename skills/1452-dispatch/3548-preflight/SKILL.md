  (use waypoints).

# Preflight

Capture what the user wants *before* anyone decides how to build it. One file, `docs/<slug>/INTENT.md`, then stop. This is the first tier of the dispatch ladder.

## Route first

**If the user wants the work done, this is the wrong skill.** Preflight refuses to decide *how* and never executes, so a request that means "figure this out and build it" gets a file and no code — a silent no-op from the user's point of view.

Check before Step 1. Hand off by name, in one line, and stop:

- Wants it planned and built now, this session → **`hop`** *(the skill once named `preflight`)*
- Wants a full spec and a task tree frozen to disk → **`flightplan`**
- Wants a multi-milestone roadmap → **`waypoints`**
- Wants the want written down and nothing else → stay here.

Ambiguous? Ask once: *"record the idea, or spec it out properly now?"*

## Setup

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is **not** reliably set in Bash. Take the skill's load-time *"Base directory for this skill"* banner and set `SCRIPTS="<base-dir>/../flightplan/scripts"` — the collision check is flightplan's script, shared rather than duplicated.

**OpenCode only**: there is no banner. Set `SCRIPTS=~/.config/opencode/skills/flightplan/scripts`.

## Why this exists

PLAN.md already has `Overview`, `Goals`, `Non-goals`, `Context`, and `Open questions`, so an INTENT.md that only restates them is dead weight. Two things it does that PLAN.md structurally cannot:

1. **Capture now, spec later.** Minutes, when there is no time for a full interview. The idea survives without committing to a solution.
2. **Ordering.** PLAN.md's `Overview` / `Goals` are written *after* the solution is already in the author's head, so they get retro-fitted to it and goal drift becomes invisible. A frozen INTENT.md is the only baseline that catches it.

**The value is the timestamp, not the file.** Everything below protects that.

## Process

Follow `references/intent-template.md`. Its capture rules are the contract, not advice.

### Step 1 — Enter plan mode, agree the slug

Call `EnterPlanMode` before any text output. Then agree a kebab-case topic slug and check it:

```bash
bun "$SCRIPTS"/scaffold.ts --check <slug>
```

- `OK` → proceed.
- `INTENT: <path>` → an intent already exists for this slug. Read it, then ask: update it, or pick another slug.
- `EXISTS: <alt>` → a real plan tree is already there. Ask before going further.

### Step 2 — Interview short

Three to six `AskUserQuestion` rounds, one to two questions each. Cover problem, outcome, who and what it touches, constraints, and the boundary as it looks today. Anything about *how* goes into `Open questions` (capture rule 1). Recommend an answer to every question you *do* ask, first option marked `(Recommended)`, so the user reacts instead of designing from scratch.

### Step 3 — Draft INTENT.md inside plan mode

Show it in full so the user can read what you understood, then call `ExitPlanMode`. Ship it with `Open questions` still open (capture rule 2).

### Step 4 — On approval, write exactly one file

```bash
mkdir -p docs/<slug>
```

Then write `docs/<slug>/INTENT.md`.

**Do not run `scaffold.ts`.** A `tasks/` tree here would make the directory read as a real plan, and `--check` would stop reporting it as an intent.

Then stop. No PLAN.md, no task files, no implementation. Tell the user that `/flightplan <slug>` picks it up later and reads this file as its baseline.

## Rules that outlive the capture

- **Update INTENT.md only when the underlying want changes, never to match a later plan.** It is the baseline; rewriting it destroys the only record of the drift. A PLAN.md that contradicts it records the contradiction in its own `## Context`.
- **Write it in English**, like every other dispatch artifact — a later session or sub-agent picks it up cold. Interview in whatever language the user prefers.

## Additional resources

- `references/intent-template.md` — the INTENT.md template and the five capture rules
