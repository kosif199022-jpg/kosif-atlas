# Testing

Write or fix tests for the files specified (or for recently changed files if none are specified).

## Tech Stack

Vitest, not Jest: `vi`, never `jest`.

## Test location conventions

| Segment | Test location |
|---------|--------------|
| `features/{f}/api/`, `models/`, `hooks/`, `lib/` | `…/tests/` next to that segment |
| `entities/{e}/api/`, `model/` | `…/tests/` |
| `widgets/{w}/hooks/`, `model/` | `…/tests/` |
| `app/router/{auth,error,root,guards}/` executable modules | `…/tests/` |
| Component folders under `ui/` | colocated `{name}.test.tsx` (the only colocated exception) |
| `shared/lib/*` | one `shared/lib/tests/` for every unit |
| `shared/api/` | `shared/api/tests/` |

Rules (constraints: `rules/testing.mdc`):
- Every executable file in the change gets a test — see [File Selection](references/file-selection.md) for the only exemptions.
- Mock only the boundary: the fetcher (or `@/shared/api/base`), `useNavigate`, missing browser APIs, time, env flags. Partial mocks use `importOriginal`. Never mock children, `@/shared/ui/*`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`, i18n, or the component's own hooks/models/store — see [Mock Patterns](references/mock-patterns.md).
- Assert the English copy from `en.json`, never a translation key.
- No comments in test files (no `// Arrange`, no section labels).
- No `__fixtures__/` directories — mock objects are declared inline in the test file.
- No cross-slice tests — a test in `features/orders/` must never import from `features/documents/`.
- No MSW in unit or RTL tests — mock the module boundary with `vi.mock('@/shared/api/base')` or `vi.mock('../api/fetchers')`. MSW is for e2e only.

## Steps

1. **Determine which files need tests** — see [File Selection](references/file-selection.md)
2. **Check for an existing test** in the location from the table above — component tests sit in the component folder; everything else sits in that segment's `tests/`
3. **Create or update tests** that assert behavior. A test that only imports the module and expects it to be defined does not count
4. **Run and fix** until tests pass and coverage thresholds hold

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
yarn test:manual -u custom-button.test.tsx   # single file, watch mode
yarn test:auto                               # all tests + coverage
yarn test:coverage                           # coverage report only
yarn test:ui                                 # vitest UI
yarn test:ci                                 # CI mode
```

## Coverage Thresholds

| Metric     | Minimum |
|------------|---------|
| Branches   | 73%     |
| Functions  | 78%     |
| Lines      | 87%     |
| Statements | 86%     |

## Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] Tests placed in `tests/` inside the source segment (colocated for components)
- [ ] No `__fixtures__/` directories — mocks declared inline in test files
- [ ] No cross-slice imports in tests
- [ ] No MSW — module boundary mocked with `vi.mock`
- [ ] File list scoped from staged/changed/branch files; only the exemptions in file-selection.md excluded
- [ ] Every remaining touched source file has new or updated tests — listed file → test path
- [ ] Only the boundary is mocked; no child, shared/ui, react-hook-form, zod, i18n, or own-hook mocks
- [ ] Partial mocks use `importOriginal`; no `as ReturnType<…>` / `as unknown as` on mocks
- [ ] Assertions use the English copy; no comments in test files
- [ ] Using `vi` for mocks (NOT `jest`)
- [ ] `render` from `@/shared/lib/rendererRTL`
- [ ] `userEvent` for interactions (NOT `fireEvent`)
- [ ] All user interactions are `await`ed
- [ ] Query results stored in constants before `expect`
- [ ] `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach`
- [ ] Mock function names have `mock` prefix
- [ ] Default props defined outside test cases
- [ ] No empty tests
- [ ] Test names are descriptive — `'[action] when [condition]'`
- [ ] Critical paths covered (render, interaction, loading, error)
