# Review checklist

Final sweep after the other topics. Do not restate import-direction, public-API, query-key, or segment-spelling hits already reported. Use this list for residual under- and over-engineering.

## Evaluate

**Hard (only if not already filed)**

- DTO shape (snake_case, nullable soup) leaking into `ui/`.
- `api/` called directly from a component. A form schema in `ui/` may call `models/` pure functions. Queries, mutations, and sequences still go through `hooks/`.
- Long-lived timer, poller, or subscription with no explicit stop.
- User-facing text produced in `models/` (typed reason missing; copy belongs in `ui/`).
- Cross-model policy sitting in `entities/` instead of the owning feature.
- Analytics call that enriches its payload by reading another slice's cache or store.
- Non-idempotent event-shaped side effect (toast, per-change analytics) fired from a query transition (`usePrevious` + `notify`) instead of the SSE subscription owner.
- A second slice subscribing to an event type another slice already owns, just to add its own toast.
- New `shared/` entry with a business-specific name, or promoted before the **third** real duplicate (rule of three).
- Business rule inlined next to `await`s in an orchestration hook (threshold, predicate, "which step ran") instead of a named `models/` function.
- `models/` touching `window`/DOM/storage outside the persist-store storage binding.
- Client-side dedup / minted idempotency key (if cross-slice-workflows did not already file it).

**Judgment — under-engineering**

- Missing empty/error/stale on a data-driven surface (if routing already covered it, skip).
- Mutation with missing or wrong invalidation, already covered by api-layer — only file leftovers.
- Anemic `models/` (types only; every rule sits in `hooks/`).

**Judgment — over-engineering**

- Zustand store for state only one component needs.
- Empty `models/` folder scaffolded "for later".
- Widget or `pages/{route}/ui/` wrapper where the page could mount both features directly.
- Speculative `reset()`, extra entry points, or ports/event buses this architecture does not use.

## How

Spot-read changed or sampled `ui/` files for DTO field names and direct `api/` imports. Grep `setInterval`, `EventSource`, `subscribe` without cleanup. Grep `usePrevious` next to `notify`/`toast`. List `src/features/*/models` directories that contain no `.ts` files.

File each leftover under this topic only when no earlier topic already captured it.
