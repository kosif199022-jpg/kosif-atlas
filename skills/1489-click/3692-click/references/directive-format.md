# Execution Contract Presentation

Use this internal format only for Guarded mode. Evidence mode has no approval contract. Keep every field proportional to the work.

## Canonical contract object

Stage one JSON object with exactly these fields:

```json
{
  "outcome": "concrete result and user-visible behavior",
  "boundary": {
    "in_scope": ["approved behavior or system boundary"],
    "out_of_scope": ["explicitly unchanged behavior or excluded work"]
  },
  "must_hold": ["observable requirement or compatibility promise that must remain true"],
  "build": {
    "approach": ["smallest repository-aware implementation route"]
  },
  "verification": {
    "scale": "focused",
    "evidence": [
      {
        "id": "E1",
        "kind": "argv",
        "description": "one cheapest sufficient source",
        "dependencies": ["src/**/*.py", "tests/", "pyproject.toml"]
      }
    ],
    "done_when": [
      {
        "condition": "observable completion condition",
        "primary_evidence": "E1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "plain_language": "Self-contained easy narrative that faithfully covers the result, changes, safeguards, exclusions, and completion checks."
}
```

`outcome`, `boundary.in_scope`, `must_hold`, `build.approach`, `verification.scale`, `verification.evidence`, `verification.done_when`, and `plain_language` are required. `boundary.out_of_scope` is required but may be empty when nothing material needs exclusion. `verification.scale` must be `quick`, `focused`, or `full`.

Declare each source once in `evidence` with `id`, `kind`, and `description`. IDs start with a letter, use at most 32 letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens, and are unique. `kind` is one of `argv`, `browser`, `hosted`, `manual`, or `existing`. An `argv` source may also include a non-empty `dependencies` list when repository evidence supports a precise boundary; other kinds must omit it. Approval binds those patterns into the contract digest. `*` matches within one path segment, `**` is accepted only as a complete segment and crosses directories, and a trailing slash selects a directory prefix. Absolute paths, traversal, backslashes, `?`, character classes, partial `**`, duplicates, and unmatched patterns fail closed to an ordinary verification run. Omit `dependencies` when uncertain; it is an optimization declaration, not a sufficiency claim.

Each `done_when` object has exactly one non-empty `condition` and one `primary_evidence` id that resolves to the registry. Every source must be referenced, while one id may be reused by several conditions. Do not add a second source for the same condition merely to repeat proof through another tool or surface. Bind every `argv` check to its declared source with `evidence_id` in the final verification batch. The chosen profile communicates intended depth qualitatively; it creates no numeric source or cumulative-work ceiling. Use at most one `browser` source and reference that id from every condition covered by its metered representative session. After the last relevant mutation, explicitly finalize a successful Browser source or attest one collected hosted, manual, or existing source with the evidence-completion capability. The Hook independently executes argv checks and observes its matched Browser path; other kinds remain explicit agent attestations rather than independently proven external events.

The Hook treats `condition`, `description`, and the other contract prose as opaque text. Enforcement follows typed fields, ids, references, valid profile names, and explicit capability argv; natural-language keywords do not grant permissions or create numeric limits. Exact executable names, options, tool names, and explicit Click directives remain protocol syntax rather than semantic prose.

Only when material, add `build.semantics` as a non-empty list for state, failure, security, concurrency, migration, or compatibility meaning; `build.order` as a non-empty list for a real sequencing constraint; or `verification.intermediate_gate` as a non-empty string for one irreversible boundary. Otherwise omit them. Do not add unsupported fields.

## One semantic contract, not many checkpoints

Show the authoritative fields top-down: outcome and boundary; must-hold conditions; the compact build approach and any material semantics or order; then verification.

The contract fixes the result, boundary, must-hold conditions, material behavior, and verification commitment. Its selected profile records intended verification depth qualitatively; the Hook neither scores that choice nor creates a numeric argv ceiling from it. It does not freeze every library, tool, file, or low-level tactic. Necessary in-scope dependencies, MCP tools, external services, graders, and implementation choices are authorized by approval unless the contract explicitly excludes them.

Do not split the build approach into phases, steps, tasks, or another mirrored plan. The contract exists to approve the result and its boundary, not to make the user review several versions of the same implementation description.

## Human approval surface

Keep `plain_language` inside the canonical digest-bound object. It is the default approval body and must read as a self-contained explanation rather than a technical field list. It must preserve the material meaning of the result, in-scope changes, exclusions, must-hold safeguards, implementation consequences, and completion evidence. Prefer a concrete example when useful, followed by what changes, safeguards, exclusions, and a one-sentence summary. Describe the qualitative verification profile in ordinary language.

Render the exact Hook-provided easy body once in the user's language with the emitted `contract_id`. Do not independently summarize, expand, or repeat it. Keep the canonical JSON hidden unless the user asks for the **original contract**. The easy body is a projection of the exact staged object, not a second or weaker contract.

If the user requests the original contract, show the exact canonical JSON supplied to the successful stage call and the same `contract_id`. Do not pass, change, or restage it merely to disclose it. The request itself is not approval. Because the original object contains `plain_language`, an explicitly requested disclosure may show that field again; this is not a duplicate default summary.

## Single approval

Run `click-gate stage '<Execution Contract JSON>'` once. The Hook validates and binds the canonical contract digest, creates a fresh opaque lifecycle handle, emits the ID marker below, and injects the exact easy approval body plus presentation instructions into the successful stage Hook context:

```text
CLICK_CONTRACT_ID=ctr_<32 lowercase hex characters>
```

`contract_id` is not a contract field and does not replace the stored digest. Show the emitted id with the Hook-generated easy body, then end with one compact question in the user's language equivalent to:

> The contract above is explained in plain language. Do you approve it as written, or would you like to see the original contract first?

Make four responses available: approve, request changes, cancel, or view the original contract.

Stop without mutation. The original request is not approval of an unseen contract. Staging records `staged_turn_id`; the Hook rejects pass and a replacement stage in that same `UserPromptSubmit` turn. A materially revised proposal receives a new id. An in-scope detail or narrowing follow-up is digest-recorded on the existing contract and does not require reapproval. That digest proves the request was recorded; the runtime does not semantically prove that it was in scope.

Only after a later user turn explicitly approves the shown proposal, run `click-gate pass ctr_<32hex>`. Pass only the exact emitted id—never resend or reconstruct the contract JSON. The Hook matches the id to the staged digest, records `approved_turn_id`, and preserves the derived verification state. An approved but incomplete contract reuses the same id when implementation resumes in a later turn. Turn separation proves that another user response occurred; the Skill still must interpret that response faithfully because the Hook does not semantically classify approval words.
