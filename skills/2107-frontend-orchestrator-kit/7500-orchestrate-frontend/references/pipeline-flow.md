# Pipeline Flow — Frontend Orchestrator Kit (CANONICAL)

**Invoked by**: the `orchestrate-frontend` skill (`SKILL.md`), or `app-orchestrator-kit:orchestrate-app`

> This file is the single source of truth for station order in this kit. It does **not** re-define
> station order *inside* spec-dev-kit, html-generator-kit, or feature-dev-kit — each of those owns
> its own `references/pipeline-flow.md` and its own human gates. This file only sequences the three
> kits and the UI checklist loop around them.
>
> Cross-kit data: **paths + `kit-result.json`**. See `context-budget.md` and `result-envelope.md`.
> If another file in this kit disagrees, this file plus those two win.

## Station Map

| # | Station | Delegate to | Notes |
|---|---------|-------------|-------|
| 0 | Resume check | this skill *(inline)* | Read `.spec/app/current.json`, then `.spec/app/task-checklist.md`; if spec is newer, offer Station 2a re-derive before Station 3 |
| 1 | Spec | `spec-dev-kit:generate-spec` | Skip when `SKIP_UPSTREAM` or an `approved` spec already matches. Requires `.spec/context/*.md`. Callee writes the watch pointer once `RUN_DIR` exists and polls `spec-orchestrator` |
| 2 | Prototype | `html-generator-kit:generate-html` | Optional. Skip when `SKIP_UPSTREAM`. Pass `SPEC_PATH`, `PULSE`, `PULSE_SCRIPT`. Capture `{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/html-kit-result.json` |
| 2a | Checklist derivation | `scripts/build-checklist.mjs` + this skill | **UI screens only.** Script reads `spec.md` from disk. Human confirms the list |
| 3 | Task loop | `feature-dev-kit:feature-dev` (once per feature) | Paths + ids + `PULSE`. Clean git tree required. Envelope → `done` / `pending` / `blocked` / leave `in-progress`. Stale pulse rebuilds once |
| 4 | Report | this skill *(inline)* | Write `frontend-kit-result.json`; paths + checklist counts; remind `/create-pr` |

## Ownership invariants

- **Each delegated kit keeps its own `AskUserQuestion` gates.** This skill never answers on their
  behalf and never bypasses them by pre-approving.
- **This skill owns**: Station 0 spec-newer prompt, Station 2 prototype yes/skip, Station 2a
  checklist confirm, Station 3 dirty-tree and continue/pause/abort.
- **Blackboard**: `task-checklist.md` is the only cross-run **progress** file. Callee outcomes
  are `kit-result.json` files. Chat is not a store.
- **A task is `done` only when** feature-dev’s envelope `outcome` is `approved` (its Station 12).
  Never mark `done` from a partial transcript.
- **Do not edit `.spec/app/work-plan.md`.** That file is owned by `app-orchestrator-kit`.

## Outcomes (canonical)

| Envelope `outcome` | Checklist `status` |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| `approved` | `done` (record `slug` / `branch`) |
| `aborted` (human declined) | `pending` |
| `error` (structural: rejected dep, missing scoped import, …) | `blocked` + `blocked-reason` |
| missing envelope (crash mid-station) | leave `in-progress`; resume re-offers it |
| pulse exit 3, 4, or 5, envelope missing | leave `in-progress` and rebuild that station once; then `blocked` + `blocked-reason: stale-agent` |
| envelope `error` with `reason: stale-agent` | `blocked` + `blocked-reason: stale-agent`; ask once; do not start the next feature |

Do **not** use a second mapping. `SKILL.md` and this file must match. A fresh pulse is not `approved`.

## Station 3 — Feature Loop

```
features = read(task-checklist.md).features
for feature in features (in file order):
  if feature.status in [done, skipped]: continue
  if feature.status == blocked: ask human whether to retry or keep skipping; else continue
  if git working tree dirty: ask commit / stash / abort-feature; do not spawn dirty

  set feature.status = in-progress; persist checklist
  do not check out develop / main / master between features

  spawn feature-dev-kit:feature-dev once for this feature (nested tasks are not extra calls):
    REQUEST:        one line — feature id + "nested tasks in CHECKLIST_PATH; read UPSTREAM_SPEC"
    UPSTREAM_SPEC:  {spec.md path}
    FEATURE_ID:     feature.id
    SLICE_REF:      feature.slice-ref, or omit on a 1.x checklist
    TASK_IDS:       comma-separated nested task ids
    SCREEN_REFS:    comma-separated nested screen-refs
    STORY_REFS:     union of nested task story-refs
    AC_REFS:        union of nested task ac-refs
    ENTITY_REFS:    union of nested task entity-refs
    PROTOTYPE_REF:  checklist.prototype-ref      # may be empty
    CHECKLIST_PATH: {task-checklist.md path}
    SLUG_HINT:      feature.slug-hint
    PARENT_BRANCH:  current HEAD when it is feature/*; empty on the first feature
    CHANGE:         remove                       # only when a nested task change is remove
    RESULT_OUT:     {checklist dir}/results/{feature.id}.json
    PULSE:          .spec/features/{slug-hint}.context/pulse.json
    PULSE_SCRIPT:   {PULSE_SCRIPT}
    WATCH:          .spec/app/watch/current.json
    (never inline spec body, stories, or ACs)

  envelope = Read(RESULT_OUT)   # fallback feature kit-result.json
  # before that, check-pulse.mjs --check on WATCH.pulse — see agent-liveness.md
  copy slug, branch, parent_branch onto the feature; mark nested tasks done on approved
  persist checklist

  if more features remain:
    AskUserQuestion — continue (checkout -b the next feature on this HEAD) / pause / abort
```

**No second feature starts until that question is answered.**

Git: `new-feature.sh` refuses a dirty tree and prints `PARENT` as the branch it was cut from.
`git checkout -b` for the next feature is from **current HEAD** (the previous `feature/*` branch).
Do not retarget that parent to `develop` / `main` / `master`. Independent PRs require pause +
`/create-pr` (or merge) before Continue.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Empty `.spec/context/` and no approved spec | STOP before invoking generate-spec |
| Envelope `aborted` / `error` from Station 1 | STOP — nothing downstream can run |
| `html-generator-kit` declined or envelope aborted | `PROTOTYPE_REF = ""`; continue to Station 2a |
| `build-checklist.mjs` produces zero features | Surface `SPEC_PATH` and stop |
| Dirty tree at Station 3 | Do not spawn; commit/stash/block |
| feature-dev envelope missing | Leave `in-progress`; never mark `done`. If the pulse is exit 3, 4, or 5, rebuild once, then `blocked` / `stale-agent` |
| Pulse not responding or stalled | Follow `agent-liveness.md`. Do not end the turn while status is `working` |
| Checklist file corrupted / unparsable | STOP — human fixes or deletes it |
