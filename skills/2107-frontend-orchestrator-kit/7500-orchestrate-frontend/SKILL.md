name: orchestrate-frontend
description: Runs the frontend-only app-dev-kit pipeline — spec-dev-kit to author a spec if needed, html-generator-kit to prototype it, then feature-dev-kit once per feature (nested UI screen-tasks share that call, stacked branch, and commit) — tracked against a persisted, resumable frontend checklist. Does not build backend APIs or AI agents (use /orchestrate-app for the full-stack dispatcher, or /backend-dev and /agent-dev). Cross-kit handoff is file paths and kit-result.json envelopes, never inlined spec or prototype bodies. Use when starting or resuming a React/FSD feature loop, not a single feature (for a single feature, use feature-dev-kit's /feature-dev directly).

# Orchestrate Frontend

**Entry point for**: the frontend track (spec → prototype → UI screen-tasks)
**Delegates to**: `spec-dev-kit:generate-spec`, `html-generator-kit:generate-html`,
`feature-dev-kit:feature-dev` — each invoked as its own plugin skill, each keeping its own gates
**State file**: `.spec/app/task-checklist.md` (legacy runs keep it beside `spec.md`)
**Handoff**: `references/result-envelope.md` + `references/context-budget.md`

This skill runs in the **main conversation**. It owns every `AskUserQuestion` call **of its own**.
Delegated kits own theirs. After a callee returns, Read its `kit-result.json` — do not keep its
transcript, spec body, or prototype files in this context.

Invokable by a human (`/orchestrate-frontend`) **or** by `app-orchestrator-kit:orchestrate-app`
(pass `SPEC_PATH` / `PROTOTYPE_REF` / `SKIP_UPSTREAM` so this skill skips Stations 1–2).

---

## Resolve KIT_DIR (do this first)

`KIT_DIR` is the **plugin root** (the directory that contains `skills/`). Resolve in this order;
use the first that exists:

1. Parent of this skill folder — `{this SKILL.md directory}/../..` (Claude: if
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is set, `KIT_DIR` is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`).
2. `app-dev-kit/frontend-orchestrator-kit` relative to the workspace root (this marketplace repo).
3. `.spec/frontend-orchestrator-kit`, then legacy `.spec/orchestrator-kit`.

All script and reference paths are `{KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-frontend/…`. Never hardcode
`.spec/orchestrator-kit/skills/…`.

`PULSE_SCRIPT` is the argument when a parent passed one, otherwise
`{KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs`. `WATCH` is
`.spec/app/watch/current.json` unless a parent passed another path.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check | If missing |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| `spec-dev-kit`, `html-generator-kit`, `feature-dev-kit` installed | Skill names resolve | STOP — install the plugin |
| `.spec/context/*.md` (new run with no approved spec and no `SKIP_UPSTREAM`) | `Glob(".spec/context/*.md")` | STOP — drop requirement `.md` files, then retry |
| FSD host (before Station 3) | `src/app`, `src/pages`, `src/features`, `src/entities`, `src/shared` | STOP — feature-dev-kit does not clone a starter |
| `frontend-dev-kit` (before Station 3) | `architecture-audit` skill resolvable | STOP — required companion |
| Clean git tree (before each Station 3 spawn) | `git status --porcelain` | AskUserQuestion: commit, stash, or abort — do not invoke feature-dev |

Do not pre-install a delegated kit’s own dependencies (`ui-ux-pro-max`, shadcn MCP) — each kit
resolves those at run time.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `[app-name or existing spec/checklist slug]` | Optional | Matches `slug` in `.spec/app/current.json`. Free text starts a new app. Omitted → this skill asks for the app name/description. |

Structured fields (from `orchestrate-app` or the human) may accompany the argument:

```
SPEC_PATH:      {path to approved spec.md}
PROTOTYPE_REF:  {prototype dir or empty}
SKIP_UPSTREAM:  true          # skip Stations 1–2; spec already approved
RESULT_OUT:     {optional extra envelope path}
PULSE_SCRIPT:   {optional; default is this kit's scripts/check-pulse.mjs}
WATCH:          {optional; default .spec/app/watch/current.json}
```

```
/orchestrate-frontend
/orchestrate-frontend demo-app
/orchestrate-frontend "a review tool for profiles"
```

---

## Steps

Read `references/pipeline-flow.md`, `references/context-budget.md`, and `references/agent-liveness.md` before starting.

### Station 0 — Resume check

A fresh session starts by reading `.spec/app/current.json`. Do not recover the spec from chat.

1. If `SPEC_PATH` was passed and that `spec.md` exists, use it. Else read `.spec/app/current.json`.
   When `spec_path` is set and the argument is omitted or equals `slug`, use that path.
   The checklist is `.spec/app/task-checklist.md` (not beside the spec folder).
   If the argument matches `slug`:
   - Read the checklist YAML **only** (id/title/status/paths — not a dump of the spec).
   - `SPEC_PATH` = `spec-ref`. If that file is missing, STOP.
   - Read `status:` from the spec **front matter only**. If it is not `approved`, STOP — finish
     `/generate-spec` first.
   - If `spec.md` is newer than checklist `updated`, or `build-checklist.mjs` would add/block
     tasks: `AskUserQuestion` — **Re-derive checklist** (run Station 2a, keep existing
     `done`/`skipped` ids) · **Resume as-is** · **Abort**.
   - Otherwise jump to **Station 3** at the first **feature** whose `status` is not `done` or `skipped`.
     Treat leftover `in-progress` as the first item to re-offer (do not mark it `done`).
     When that feature is `in-progress` and `slug` is set, check its pulse first:

     ```bash
     node {PULSE_SCRIPT} \
       --check --pulse ".spec/features/{slug}.context/pulse.json"
     ```

     No `slug` is exit 4 (missing). Exit 2 → re-offer `{dirname(pulse)}/packet.json`; do not rebuild.
     Exit 3, 4, or 5 → log `stale-agent — rebuilding` and rebuild that feature once at Station 3
     (`--rebuilds 1` on the watch pointer). A second stale return sets `blocked` /
     `blocked-reason: stale-agent` and asks once. Exit 0 → re-offer; do not mark `done`.
     Report: `"Resuming frontend {slug} — {done}/{total} features done."`
2. Otherwise this is a new run — continue to Station 1 (or Station 2a when `SKIP_UPSTREAM` is set).

### Station 1 — Spec

If `SKIP_UPSTREAM` is set or `SPEC_PATH` already points at an `approved` spec, skip to Station 2.

Read `.spec/app/current.json`. If `spec_path` exists and the spec `status` is `approved`, set
`SPEC_PATH` to that file and skip to Station 2. Do not glob for a newer spec folder.

If none approved:

1. `Glob(".spec/context/*.md")`. If empty → STOP:
   `"No requirement files found in .spec/context/. Drop .md files there, then re-run /orchestrate-frontend."`
   Do **not** invoke generate-spec (it would stop the same way after loading its skill body).
2. Invoke `spec-dev-kit:generate-spec` with the **slug/app name only** — never paste context-file
   contents. It owns its HITL gate. Pass the liveness paths (it writes the watch pointer once
   `RUN_DIR` exists, then polls `spec-orchestrator`):

   ```
   WATCH:        .spec/app/watch/current.json
   PULSE_SCRIPT: {PULSE_SCRIPT}
   ```

3. After it returns, run the post-return check in `references/agent-liveness.md` on the pulse
   recorded in `.spec/app/watch/current.json`. Then read `.spec/app/current.json`.
   - `spec_path` set and the envelope is `approved` → `SPEC_PATH` = that path.
   - Envelope `error` with `reason: stale-agent`, or a missing envelope whose pulse is still
     exit 3, 4, or 5 after one rebuild → STOP. Ask once. Nothing downstream can run.
   - missing pointer or `aborted` / `error` → STOP. Nothing downstream can run.

Do not Read `spec.md` body here.

### Station 2 — Prototype (optional)

If `SKIP_UPSTREAM` is set, keep the passed `PROTOTYPE_REF` (may be `""`) and skip the prompt.

Otherwise `AskUserQuestion` — "Generate a clickable HTML prototype before building features? (recommended for
apps with more than one screen)" — **Yes** / **Skip**.

On **Yes**: write the watch pointer, then invoke `html-generator-kit:generate-html` with structured
fields, **not** a pasted spec:

```bash
node {PULSE_SCRIPT} \
  --watch .spec/app/watch/current.json \
  --station 2 \
  --pulse "{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/watch/html-orchestrator.json"
```

```
SPEC_PATH:    {SPEC_PATH}
PULSE:        {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/watch/html-orchestrator.json
PULSE_SCRIPT: {PULSE_SCRIPT}
WATCH:        .spec/app/watch/current.json
```

Argument: the spec **folder name** (`spec-{tc}_{slug}`) or the `spec.md` path — generate-html
treats an existing `spec.md` path as `SPEC_FILE` and will not re-glob “most recent”.

After return, run the post-return check in `references/agent-liveness.md`, then Read
`{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/html-kit-result.json`:

- `outcome: approved` → `PROTOTYPE_REF` = envelope `prototype_ref` (the **new** prototype
  timecode folder — not the spec folder’s timecode).
- `error` with `reason: stale-agent`, or a missing envelope whose pulse is still exit 3, 4, or 5
  after one rebuild → ask once: **Continue without prototype** or **Stop**. Do not treat a stale
  run as a finished prototype.
- `aborted` / other `error` / missing → `PROTOTYPE_REF = ""` and continue to Station 2a.

On **Skip**: `PROTOTYPE_REF = ""`.

Never Read prototype HTML into this conversation.

### Station 2a — Checklist derivation (THIS skill owns this gate)

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/build-checklist.mjs {SPEC_PATH} --prototype-ref "{PROTOTYPE_REF}"
```

If `{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/artifacts/changes.json` exists, add `--changes` with that path.

The script Reads `spec.md` from disk. Do not pre-load the spec into chat.
- **Spec 2.0** (has `delivery-plan.slices`): one **feature per delivery slice** that has a
  `frontend` track, in the spec's slice order (each feature carries `slice-ref` and `depends-on`).
  Nested tasks are that slice's screens. Never re-order these features — the order is the
  dependency order the spec author approved.
- **Spec 1.x**: screens are grouped into features by owning user story, then sorted by priority.

Nested tasks stay screen-level. No API-only or agent-only stories.

Exit 1 — no buildable (non-`wont`) screens — report `SPEC_PATH` and stop.
Exit 2 — parse/usage failure — report the error lines and stop.

On exit 0, Read `task-checklist.md` YAML `features[]`. Present each feature **id, title, priority**
and its nested task titles via one `AskUserQuestion`: **Approve as-is** · **Edit** (relay free
text; you may move a task between features in the YAML; re-present) · **Abort**.

### Station 3 — Feature loop

For each feature in checklist order, skipping `done` / `skipped`. One `feature-dev` call per
feature. Nested tasks are not separate calls, branches, or commits.

0. If the feature has `depends-on` ids that are not `done`, do not start it: ask once whether to
   build the dependency first (recommended) or skip this feature for now.
1. If `status: blocked`, ask once whether to retry (`pending`) or keep skipping.
2. If `status: in-progress` (crashed prior run): check the pulse as in Station 0. Exit 3, 4, or 5
   rebuilds once. Otherwise re-offer this feature; do not assume it finished.
3. `git status --porcelain` — if dirty, `AskUserQuestion`: **Commit** (you wait; re-check) ·
   **Stash** · **Abort this feature** (`blocked`, reason: dirty tree). Never spawn feature-dev dirty.
   `new-feature.sh` will exit 1 if you skip this.
4. Set the feature `status: in-progress`, append a `## Log` line, write the checklist.
   Do **not** check out the integration branch between features. Stay on the current HEAD.
   Write the watch pointer (`rebuilds` is `1` when Station 0 already rebuilt this feature, else `0`):

   ```bash
   node {PULSE_SCRIPT} \
     --watch .spec/app/watch/current.json \
     --station 3 \
     --pulse ".spec/features/{feature.slug-hint}.context/pulse.json" \
     --feature-id {feature.id} \
     --rebuilds {0 or 1}
   ```

5. Invoke `feature-dev-kit:feature-dev` with **paths and ids only**:

   ```
   REQUEST:        Feature {feature.id} ({feature.slug-hint}). Nested tasks in CHECKLIST_PATH. Read UPSTREAM_SPEC.
   UPSTREAM_SPEC:  {SPEC_PATH}
   FEATURE_ID:     {feature.id}
   SLICE_REF:      {feature.slice-ref, or omit on a 1.x checklist}
   TASK_IDS:       {comma-separated nested task ids}
   SCREEN_REFS:    {comma-separated nested screen-refs}
   STORY_REFS:     {union of nested task story-refs}
   AC_REFS:        {union of nested task ac-refs}
   ENTITY_REFS:    {union of nested task entity-refs}
   PROTOTYPE_REF:  {checklist prototype-ref}
   CHECKLIST_PATH: {path to task-checklist.md}
   SLUG_HINT:      {feature.slug-hint}
   PARENT_BRANCH:  {current HEAD when it is feature/*; empty on the first feature}
   CHANGE:         remove
   RESULT_OUT:     {dirname(CHECKLIST_PATH)}/results/{feature.id}.json
   PULSE:          .spec/features/{feature.slug-hint}.context/pulse.json
   PULSE_SCRIPT:   {PULSE_SCRIPT}
   WATCH:          .spec/app/watch/current.json
   ```

   Pass `CHANGE=remove` only when a nested task `change` is `remove`. Those screen refs are deletions.
   Pass the ref unions from the checklist (after any Station 2a edit) so feature-dev builds exactly
   what the human approved instead of re-deriving it.

   Do **not** paste user stories, ACs, or spec YAML into `REQUEST`. feature-dev’s
   `import-upstream.mjs` reads `UPSTREAM_SPEC`.
6. After return, run `check-pulse.mjs --check` on the pulse path in `.spec/app/watch/current.json`
   (`references/agent-liveness.md`). Then Read `RESULT_OUT` (fallback: `.spec/features/{slug}.kit-result.json`).
   - `outcome: approved` → feature `status: done`; copy `slug`, `branch`, and `parent_branch`
     onto `slug` / `branch` / `parent-branch`; mark nested tasks `done`; log. The envelope is
     still required — a fresh pulse alone is not `done`.
   - `outcome: aborted` → feature `status: pending`; log `reason`. Do not start the next feature.
   - `outcome: error` → feature `status: blocked`; `blocked-reason` = envelope `reason`.
     `reason: stale-agent` → ask once. Do not start the next feature.
   - missing envelope, pulse exit 3, 4, or 5, and `rebuilds` is 0 → leave `in-progress`; log
     `stale-agent — rebuilding`; set `rebuilds` to 1; re-invoke this feature once from its
     checkpoint. Do not start the next feature.
   - missing envelope after that rebuild, or pulse still exit 3, 4, or 5 → `blocked`,
     `blocked-reason: stale-agent`; ask once; stop.
   - missing envelope after a crash that is not a stale pulse → leave `in-progress`; log
     “no kit-result”; on resume, re-offer.
7. If features remain: `AskUserQuestion` —
   "Feature {n}/{total} is committed on {branch}. Continue cuts the next branch with checkout -b
   on top of this one. Continue, pause, or abort?"
   - **Continue** → next feature (stacked on the current feature branch).
   - **Pause** → write the run-level envelope (`outcome: approved` if any feature `done`, else
     `aborted`) and STOP. Re-running `/orchestrate-frontend {slug}` resumes here.
   - **Abort** → write envelope `aborted`; STOP; checklist stays as-is.

**No second feature starts until that question is answered.**

### Station 4 — Report

Write the run-level envelope **before** the human-readable report:

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/write-kit-result.mjs \
  --out {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/frontend-kit-result.json \
  --kit orchestrate-frontend \
  --outcome approved \
  --spec-path {SPEC_PATH} \
  --prototype-ref "{PROTOTYPE_REF}" \
  --slug {slug} \
  --run-dir {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}
```

If `RESULT_OUT` was passed, also `--also {RESULT_OUT}`.

Read the checklist file. Report **paths and counts only**:

```
✅ Frontend pipeline run for {slug}
Spec:       {SPEC_PATH}
Prototype:  {PROTOTYPE_REF or "skipped"}
Checklist:  {done}/{total} features done, {skipped} skipped, {blocked} blocked
Envelope:   {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/frontend-kit-result.json

Branches ready for review (run /create-pr yourself for each):
  - {feature.branch}  ({feature.title}, parent {feature.parent-branch})
  ...

Remaining: {pending titles} — re-run /orchestrate-frontend {slug} to continue.
```

---

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never bypass a delegated kit’s gate.** Wait; do not pre-approve.
2. **Progress lives in `task-checklist.md` + `kit-result.json`, not in chat.**
3. **Paths, not blobs** — `references/context-budget.md`.
4. **One feature sub-run at a time**, with confirmation between each. Nested tasks share that run.
5. **Automation never ships.** `/create-pr` stays human-typed.
6. **UI screen-tasks only.** Do not spawn feature-dev for API-only or agent-only stories.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Callee skill not found | Install the plugin, retry |
| `build-checklist.mjs` exits 1 | Spec has no non-`wont` screens — revise the spec or use `/orchestrate-app` for backend/agent tracks |
| `kit-result.json` missing after a Skill return | Run the pulse check. Stale or missing → rebuild that station once, then `blocked` / `stale-agent`. Do not guess paths from chat |
| Pulse `not-responding` or `stalled` | The callee polls `references/agent-liveness.md`. Do not mark the feature `done` |
| Dirty tree blocks Station 3 | Commit or stash; `new-feature.sh` refuses a dirty worktree |
| Checklist `blocked` after a spec edit | Source screen removed — confirm at Station 2a |
| Want to restart one task | Set its row to `pending`, clear `slug`/`branch`, re-run |
