name: review-loop
description: Drive every reviewer thread on a GitHub pull request to zero unresolved in bounded iterations. Covers bot reviewers such as Greptile and Devin and human reviewers. Fetches every inline comment, review, and issue comment, fixes what is actionable, replies, resolves bot threads through GraphQL, re-requests review once per push, and ends with a fixed-format report. Use when the user says "review loop", "address the review comments", "get this PR to zero unresolved", "greploop", or "make Greptile happy".

# Review loop

This skill has one job: take a GitHub PR with open review threads and drive every thread, from
every reviewer, to zero unresolved, in a bounded number of iterations, then report what it did
in a fixed format. It does not QA the running application; that is `autoqa`'s job. It does not
decide whether the diff is safe beyond what reviewers raised; that is `blast-radius`'s job. It
does not merge, and it does not mint credentials.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Repository (`owner/repo`) | no | The `origin` remote of the current checkout |
| PR number | no | The PR for the current branch (`gh pr view`) |
| Target (`open-for-review`, `review-clean`, or `merge-ready`) | no | `review-clean` |
| Trigger comment text | no | `@greptile-apps review` |
| `--max-iterations N` | no | 3 |
| Gate command | no | None. The caller or the repository supplies the command that runs tests and lint (for example the repo's `make check`); the skill only says where in the loop it runs |
| Base-branch sync | no | None. The caller or repository supplies the rebase or merge policy; the skill says where it runs |

Auth precondition: the caller has authenticated `gh` before invoking this skill. The skill
never mints, reads, or stores tokens. If `gh auth status` fails, stop and report it.

## Iteration

Repeat at most `--max-iterations` times; the default is 3, and a caller raises it only for a
stated reason. Each iteration:

1. Sync with the base branch if the caller supplied a sync policy. Run the gate command when
   the head changed or no exact-head result exists. Reuse valid exact-head evidence. A red
   gate stops the iteration; fix the gate before touching review comments.
2. Fetch every open thread. See "Fetching everything". Do not filter to one reviewer.
3. Triage by content, not by author. For each thread decide: actionable (a code change is
   needed), informational (no change, reply explains why), or false positive (reply explains
   why). Record the decision. A reply that proves inherited behavior or base parity without
   a code push keeps prior exact-head evidence valid. Do not rerun gates or restart proof and
   description work.
4. Fix every actionable item in one pass. Read the file at the cited line, understand the
   comment in context, make the change.
5. If code changed, run the gate command again. Do not push a red gate.
6. If code changed, commit and push. Commit message names the iteration, for example
   `Address review feedback (review-loop iteration 2)`.
7. Reply and resolve. See "Human threads" and "Bot threads". A reply goes on the thread that
   raised the point, not in a new top-level comment.
8. Re-request review once per push. A reply without a push does not require another request.
   See "Greptile specifics" and "Devin specifics". Wait for the results with a bounded poll.
9. Check the target. For `review-clean` or `merge-ready`, require zero unresolved threads
   across every reviewer and, when Greptile is installed, a 5/5 score from its latest summary.
   For `open-for-review`, require a non-draft PR and focused proof. Automated review may
   remain pending.

If the cap is reached with threads still open, stop and report them; do not start another
iteration.

## Fetching everything

Fetch all three comment sources on every iteration; a reviewer can use any of them.

```bash
# Inline review threads with resolution state (GraphQL; paginate on endCursor)
gh api graphql -f query='...' # see references/graphql-queries.md

# Reviews (approve, request changes, comment) with bodies
gh api --paginate "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews?per_page=100"

# Issue comments on the PR conversation tab (Greptile summaries, Devin notes, humans)
gh api --paginate "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<PR_NUMBER>/comments?per_page=100"
```

A thread is open when `isResolved` is false. A review body or issue comment is a thread when it
asks for a change or a reply; treat it as open until it is answered. Bot summaries that edit in
place (Greptile does this) must be read by `updated_at`, not `created_at`.

## Human threads

- Reply on the thread with what was done and why, citing the commit. When nothing was
  changed, say what was considered and why the code stays as is.
- Never resolve a thread a human opened without replying first. Prefer to leave resolution of
  human threads to the human unless the repository's policy says the author resolves.
- Never dismiss a human review. A "changes requested" review is cleared by the reviewer
  re-reviewing, and re-requesting review is the only action the loop takes on it.

## Bot threads

Resolve a bot thread after its item is fixed or answered. Use the GraphQL
`resolveReviewThread` mutation, batched with aliases, and assert the result:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  t1: resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "ID1"}) { thread { isResolved } }
  t2: resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "ID2"}) { thread { isResolved } }
}'
```

Every alias in the response must report `isResolved: true`. If one does not, re-fetch the
thread and treat it as still open; do not count it as resolved. Batch up to 20 aliases per
request. Full queries are in `references/graphql-queries.md`.

Resolving is only the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation. A REST reply (the
`pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies` endpoint) answers a thread but never resolves it, and a
replied-but-unresolved thread still fails the zero-unresolved exit criterion. Always resolve
through GraphQL, never assume a reply resolved anything.

## Greptile specifics

- Before posting a trigger comment, check for a run already in progress. Look at
  `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --json name,state` and at
  `repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<HEAD_SHA>/check-runs` for a check whose name matches
  `greptile` (case-insensitive). If its state is `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`, do not post; wait
  for it.
- The trigger comment text is configurable; the default is `@greptile-apps review`. Post it at
  most once per push. Keep it to the mention: the reason for the re-review belongs in the
  thread replies, which Greptile reads, not in the trigger. A trigger must be a new comment;
  do not rely on an edited comment to start a review.
- After the triggered review finishes (the summary's `updated_at` is later than the trigger),
  collapse the earlier trigger comments by the caller's agent identities with the GraphQL
  `minimizeComment` mutation, classifier `OUTDATED`. A trigger is any such comment that
  mentions `@greptile-apps`, including older prose triggers. Never collapse the latest
  trigger or a human's comment, and never delete a trigger. See
  `references/graphql-queries.md`.
- Poll the check run at 10-second intervals for up to 10 minutes. A check run that has only
  just appeared but is still `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS` is not a result: wait for a terminal
  `conclusion` AND for the summary comment's `updated_at` to move past the trigger time before
  reading a score. A freshly-appeared check run beside an unchanged summary means Greptile has
  started but not finished, and reading the old summary then records a stale score.
- On large PRs the tagged review may never create a check run for the new head; Greptile instead
  edits its existing summary comment. If no check run appears after a few attempts, poll the most
  recently updated Greptile issue comment and stop when its `updated_at` is later than the trigger
  comment and its body carries a score.
- Read the score from three places and use the most recently updated one: the most recently
  updated Greptile-authored issue comment (it edits in place, so sort by `updated_at`), the PR
  body, and the latest review from `greptile-apps[bot]` or `greptile-apps-staging[bot]`. The
  score looks like `3/5`, `5/5`, or `Confidence: 3/5`.
- Freshness gate: a score counts only for the current head. Resolve the commit it was produced
  for (the Greptile check run's `head_sha`, or a summary whose `updated_at` post-dates the head
  commit) and compare it to the PR's current head SHA. A score from an earlier commit is stale:
  re-trigger, wait, and never record it as the exit criterion.
- Carry forward the items under "Prompt to fix all with AI" in the Greptile summary comment,
  even when the inline comment endpoint returns zero unresolved comments. They count as open
  until fixed or answered.
- For `review-clean` or `merge-ready`, Greptile requires `5/5` and zero unresolved
  Greptile threads.

## Devin specifics

- Devin reviews when the PR becomes ready for review. A draft PR never gets a Devin review.
  If the PR is a draft and the caller wants Devin's review, mark it ready (`gh pr ready`) and
  say so in the report.
- Devin posts inline threads and a summary issue comment. Triage them like any other thread;
  reply and resolve through the same GraphQL path.
- Devin may report more issues than it posts ("N issues, M not posted by your settings"). The
  flags hidden by GitHub settings are not fetchable through the API and are not review threads:
  do not count them toward unresolved threads. Record them in the report as "M Devin flags not
  visible via API (see the Devin dashboard)" for a human, but the exit criterion is over the
  threads that actually exist on the PR.
- Re-requesting Devin is a push; there is no trigger comment.

## Stop on timeout

If a poll for review results times out, stop the loop and report the timeout. Never continue
with stale or missing review results, and never count a thread as resolved because the reviewer
did not answer.

## Report

End with this table. Print it even when the loop stops early.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository / PR | `owner/repo#N` |
| Iterations | N of max M |
| Threads found (per reviewer) | Greptile N, Devin N, humans N |
| Resolved this run | N |
| Replied, left open for a human | N |
| Remaining | N, then one line each: `path:line` and a short quote |
| Final Greptile score | X/5, or "not installed" |
| Stop reason | exit criterion met, max iterations, timeout, red gate, auth failure |

The report goes to the caller. Do not post it as a new PR comment. A caller that wants it on
the PR edits one comment marked `<!-- agent-sticky:review-loop -->` in place, using the upsert
recipe in `references/graphql-queries.md`.

Write the report and every reply through `unslop` before posting.
