## Critical thresholds

- **Breach notification to PDPC: 3 calendar days** after assessing as notifiable (s26D(1)). Days, not business days.
- **Significant scale threshold:** ≥ 500 affected individuals (PDP Notification of Data Breaches Regulations 2021).
- **Maximum financial penalty cap (s48J(3)):**
  - SGD 1M for organisations with Singapore turnover ≤ SGD 10M
  - 10% of Singapore turnover for organisations above SGD 10M
- **Individual criminal liability** (s48D / s48E / s48F): SGD 5,000 fine and/or 2 years imprisonment per offence

## Obligations covered

The obligation files in `obligations/` map the active parts of the Act to the universal layers in `../../layers/`:

| [02-consent.md](obligations/02-consent.md) | Part 4 Div 1 (s13–17) | Consent collection, withdrawal, deemed consent, exceptions |
| [03-purpose.md](obligations/03-purpose.md) | Part 4 Div 2 (s18–20) | Purpose limitation, notification of purpose |
| [04-access-correction.md](obligations/04-access-correction.md) | Part 5 (s21–22A) | Access right, correction right, preservation duty |
| [05-care.md](obligations/05-care.md) | Part 6 (s23–26) | Accuracy, protection, retention, transfer outside Singapore |

## What's intentionally not covered

The following are within the Act but not relevant to most consumer applications and are excluded from this skill to keep the surface focused:

- Part 9 (Do Not Call Registry) — applies to telemarketing-style messages to Singapore phone numbers; out of scope for app-style products that don't make outbound marketing calls.
- Parts 9C–9D (Enforcement, Appeals) — procedural; relevant during an active enforcement action, not for ongoing compliance.
- First/Second Schedule items irrelevant to a consumer app (debt collection, credit bureau operations, employment-context exemptions).

If your application uses outbound voice / SMS marketing to Singapore users, you'll need the Do Not Call sections in addition to this skill.

## Mental model: what makes Singapore PDPA distinctive

If you've worked with GDPR or another framework, the things to recalibrate:

- **Lawful bases are simpler.** Consent is the default; the "legitimate interest"-style alternatives (s17 + 1st/2nd Schedule) are an enumerated list of cases, not a balancing test.
- **Breach notification looks tighter than it is.** The s26D(1) window is 3 calendar days, but the clock starts at **assessment**, not awareness — and the assessment itself only has to be "reasonable and expeditious". Against the awareness-based 72-hour clocks in MY / TH / ID, SG is therefore operationally *looser*, not stricter. If you run multiple jurisdictions, do not treat the SG clock as the binding one.
- **Individual criminal liability** (s48D/E/F) is unusual — not just civil penalties on the org, but personal criminal exposure for staff who knowingly misuse data. Reflect this in the staff AUP (see [layer 01](../../layers/01-non-technical.md)).
- **Accountability ("demonstrable compliance")** is structural: regulators expect the org to show its work — DPO, policies, training records, audit logs, breach assessments.
