# Usage: gather-context.sh <diff.json> [prev_manifest.json]
# For each added/renamed/updated member in the diff, collects the cheap, high-signal
# surface a curator needs to route: README (head), the top-level tree, workflow
# trigger lines, and the commit log since the last curated sha. Emits a JSON bundle
# to stdout. Intentionally skips 'removed' members (nothing to read) but lists them
# so the curator can prune their playbook entries.
