# Deterministic fleet-membership enumeration. NO LLM. Portable bash/gh/jq.
#
# Usage: list-fleet-members.sh <owner> <glob>
#   e.g. list-fleet-members.sh acme 'service-*'
#
# Emits (stdout) a JSON manifest:
#   { "as_of": "<ISO8601 from gh, not local clock>", "members": [ {node_id, name,
#     full_name, default_branch, head_sha, pushed_at, archived, private}, ... ] }
# Members are joined logically on node_id (survives a rename; GitHub calls it
# opaque, not stable, and is migrating its format) and sorted by node_id so the
# output is byte-stable for identical upstream state.
#
# Uses orgs/<owner>/repos, falling back to users/<owner>/repos (both
# authoritative listings, correct rate bucket) — NOT the
# Search API, which is eventually consistent and rate-limited differently.
