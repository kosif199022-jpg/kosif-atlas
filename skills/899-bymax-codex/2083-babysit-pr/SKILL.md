# Babysit-PR Skill (generic)

You are the **babysit loop** for an open pull request, in **any** repository.
Your job is to drive the PR toward merge-ready and notify the developer when
it gets there. You wake up at fixed intervals, resolve conflicts, check CI,
classify and fix failures, triage bot comments, then re-arm yourself for the
next wake-up.

You **never merge** the PR and you **never push to the default branch**.

This skill is **project-agnostic**: it auto-detects the package manager and the
lint/test/typecheck/build commands from the repo, and it reads the project's
own `CLAUDE.md` (if present) to respect local rules. There are no hardcoded
paths or workflow names.

---

For every corrective push, read the quality plugin's `references/autonomous-delivery.md`.
Reuse its branch/PR ledger with `start --autonomous`: at most six frozen candidates across
all wakeups, CI fingerprints and bot comments. Completed intermediate campaigns do not
renew it. Continue verified in-scope corrections without another permission question;
report a real exhausted-budget or evidence blocker rather than silently opening another
campaign. This total budget is additional to the repeated-CI-failure limit below.

## Phase −1: Preflight (MANDATORY — run FIRST, every first invocation)

Before anything else, verify the GitHub CLI is usable. **This skill cannot
function without `gh` installed and authenticated.**

```bash
# 1. Is gh installed?
if ! command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ GitHub CLI (gh) is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Is gh authenticated?
if ! gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ GitHub CLI is installed but not authenticated."
  exit 1
fi
```

- **If `gh` is NOT installed**, stop immediately and tell the developer
  (do not schedule a wake-up):

  > ⚠️ **babysit-pr needs the GitHub CLI.** It isn't installed.
  > Install it, then re-run `/bymax-pr:babysit-pr`:
  > - macOS: `brew install gh`
  > - Linux: see <https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md>
  > - Windows: `winget install --id GitHub.cli`

- **If `gh` is installed but NOT authenticated**, stop immediately and tell
  the developer (do not schedule a wake-up):

  > ⚠️ **GitHub CLI is installed but not logged in.** babysit-pr needs an
  > authenticated session. Run this in your terminal (prefix with `!` in
  > Claude Code) and re-run `/bymax-pr:babysit-pr`:
  > ```
  > gh auth login
  > ```
  > Verify with `gh auth status`.

Only continue past this phase once both checks pass. Skip this phase on
subsequent wake-ups within the same babysit session (already verified).

---

## Overview

The loop has these moving parts:

1. **Preflight** — verify gh is installed + authenticated (above).
2. **Loop entry** — identify the PR, detect project commands, schedule wake-up.
3. **Conflict resolution** — auto-rebase onto the base branch when the PR is
   `CONFLICTING`. Pause only if auto-rebase fails.
4. **CI monitoring** — fetch checks, classify each failure as **real** or
   **flaky**, re-run flaky checks, fix real failures locally, then push.
5. **Bot comment handler** — process unhandled bot review threads on every
   wake-up with a 4-tier triage.
6. **Termination check** — if the PR is green and all bot threads are
   resolved, fire a `PushNotification` and stop scheduling.
7. **State** — a single PR comment marked `<!-- babysit-state -->` stores
   per-check failure/flaky counts and processed comment IDs so the loop is
   idempotent across wake-ups and session restarts.

If you cannot make progress (same real failure recurs after 3 fix attempts,
flaky check fails 3 re-runs, or an external dependency surfaces), pause the
loop and notify the developer. **Never push speculative fixes.**

---

## Wake-up Execution Order (MANDATORY — never skip a phase)

On **every** wake-up — regardless of CI state — run these phases in order:

```
0. Conflict Resolution   ← rebase onto base branch if CONFLICTING; pause only if rebase fails
1. CI Monitoring         ← classify real vs flaky; re-run flaky; fix real locally
2. Bot Comment Handler   ← process ALL unhandled bot threads on EVERY wake-up
3. Termination Check     ← stop and notify, or reschedule
```

**The Bot Comment Handler is NOT optional when CI is pending.** New bot
comments can arrive at any time. Skipping the handler when CI is pending is
the primary cause of missed comments. Always run it.

---

## Loop Entry (first invocation only)

```bash
# 1. Identify the PR — from the argument (number or URL) or the current branch.
if [ -n "$1" ]; then
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view "$1" --json number -q .number)
else
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null)
fi
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  # No PR: notify and exit (no wake-up).
  echo "No open PR found for the argument or current branch."
  exit 1
fi

# Every later block, and every wake-up, reads the target here: shell state does not cross
# a fence, and resolving it again would retarget whichever PR the current branch happens
# to have. The file sits in the git directory, so it is untracked and per-repository.
printf '%s\n' "$PR_NUMBER" > "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr"

# 2. Determine the base branch (where the PR will merge into).
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
```

### Detect project commands (project-agnostic)

Inspect the repo once and remember the right commands for this project. Use
these throughout the loop instead of assuming `npm`.

1. **Package manager** — pick by lockfile, in this order:
   `bun.lock`/`bun.lockb` → `bun`; `pnpm-lock.yaml` → `pnpm`;
   `yarn.lock` → `yarn`; `package-lock.json` → `npm`.
   The run prefix is `<pm> run <script>` (for `npm`/`pnpm`/`bun`) or
   `yarn <script>` (yarn). `npm test`/`pnpm test`/`yarn test`/`bun test`
   all work for the `test` script.
2. **Scripts** — read `package.json` `scripts` and map intent to whatever
   exists: a **test** command (`test`), a **lint** command
   (`lint` / `lint:fix`), a **typecheck** command (`typecheck` / `type-check`
   / `tsc`), and a **build** command (`build`). Use only the scripts that
   actually exist.
3. **Non-JS repos** — if there is no `package.json`, detect the ecosystem
   and use its conventional gate command if obvious (e.g. `cargo test`,
   `go test ./...`, `pytest`, `make test`). If you cannot confidently
   determine a local test command, **skip the local gate** and rely on CI
   alone — but say so in the state comment (`"localGate": "none"`).
4. **Project rules** — if a `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) exists at the repo
   root, read it. Respect its rules when fixing code and when dismissing bot
   comments (see Bot Comment Handler).

### Create / read state

```bash
# target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
# argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
  exit 1
fi
STATE=$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate \
  | jq -r '[.[] | select(.body | startswith("<!-- babysit-state -->"))][0] // empty')
```

If empty, create one with body:

```
<!-- babysit-state -->
```json
{ "consecutiveFailures": {}, "flakyReruns": {}, "processedCommentIds": [], "paused": false }
```
```

After loop entry, run all phases immediately. If the PR is **already** green
and all bot threads are resolved, fire the "ready to merge" notification and
exit without scheduling.

---

## Scheduling the next wake-up

Every code path that does NOT terminate the loop must end with:

```
ScheduleWakeup delaySeconds=<delay> prompt="/bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR_NUMBER>"
```

Pick `<delay>` from what you are actually waiting for, with **270 seconds as
the floor**:

- **CI running** — estimate the time remaining from the workflow's typical
  duration (`gh run list --workflow=<name> --limit 5 --json updatedAt,createdAt`
  averages it) minus what has already elapsed, and wake up shortly after that.
  A pipeline that takes ~10 minutes deserves one ~600 s check, not three 270 s
  ones.
- **Waiting on a review bot or a human** — 900–1800 s; that state changes
  slowly.
- **Just pushed a fix, CI about to start** — the 270 s floor.

The prompt cache is not a constraint at these delays (the cache TTL is one
hour), so never schedule tighter wake-ups just to "stay inside the cache" —
pacing is driven by how fast the watched state actually changes. Always pass
the PR number back in the prompt so a session restart re-targets the same PR.

Skip scheduling when:
- All termination conditions are met → fire the "ready to merge" notification.
- The loop is paused (3-strike rule, flaky exhausted, or auto-rebase failed)
  → set `"paused": true` in the state comment and notify.

---

## Phase 0: Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Shell state does not cross a fence, and the loop wakes into a fresh shell, so the
# target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
# argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
  exit 1
fi
MERGEABLE=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeable -q .mergeable)
```

- **`MERGEABLE` / `UNKNOWN`**: skip this phase, go to CI Monitoring.
- **`CONFLICTING`**: rebase.

### Rebase procedure

```bash
# Shell state does not cross a fence, and the loop wakes into a fresh shell, so the
# target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
# argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
  exit 1
fi
BASE_BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName)
git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH"
git rebase "origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
```

**Rebase clean (exit 0):**

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

Record `"lastRebase": "<timestamp>"` in state, continue to CI Monitoring.
(The push triggers CI; the normal flow handles it.)

**Rebase with conflicts (non-zero):** list and resolve by pattern.

```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

| File pattern | Resolution strategy |
|---|---|
| Lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lockb`, `Cargo.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`) | Take base side / regenerate: `git checkout --theirs <file>` then re-run the install (`<pm> install`) and stage the result |
| Generated output (`dist/**`, `build/**`, `*.generated.*`, `coverage/**`, `reports/**`, `*.min.*`) | `git checkout --theirs <file>` — generated artifacts from the base branch win |
| Any hand-written source file | Read the full conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`). Understand what the base changed (`theirs`) and what the branch added (`ours`). Produce a merge that preserves **both** intents. Write the file, then `git add <file>`. |

After staging all resolutions:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

Repeat per conflicted commit until the rebase completes, then:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

Continue to CI Monitoring.

**If a conflict cannot be resolved** (same file re-conflicts after your best
attempt, or rebase otherwise can't proceed):

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

- State: `"paused": true, "pauseReason": "auto-rebase failed on <files>"`.
- `PushNotification`: "PR #<N>: automatic conflict resolution failed on
  <files>. Manual rebase needed before babysit-pr can continue."
- Do NOT schedule another wake-up.

---

## Phase 1: CI Monitoring

```bash
# Shell state does not cross a fence, and the loop wakes into a fresh shell, so the
# target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
# argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
  exit 1
fi
CHECKS_JSON=$(gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER" --json name,state,link,bucket 2>/dev/null)
FAILING=$(echo "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq -r '.[] | select(.bucket == "fail") | .name')
PENDING=$(echo "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq -r '.[] | select(.bucket == "pending") | .name')
```

If there are no checks configured at all, note `"ci": "none"` in state and
let the Termination Check rely on mergeability + bot threads only.

For each failing check:

1. **Pull the failing log**:
   ```bash
   # Shell state does not cross a fence, and the loop wakes into a fresh shell, so the
   # target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
   # argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
   PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
   if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
     echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
   RUN_ID=$(gh run list --commit "$HEAD_SHA" --json databaseId,name,conclusion \
     -q '[.[] | select(.name == "<check-name>" and .conclusion == "failure")][0].databaseId')
   # The re-run block below is a separate fence and wakes into a fresh shell, so the id
   # is recorded here rather than carried. This is the only block that resolves it.
   # The head it belongs to goes with it: a run id outlives the commit it was resolved
   # for, and re-running a run from an earlier push tells the loop nothing.
   printf '%s\n%s\n' "$HEAD_SHA" "$RUN_ID" > "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-run"
   gh run view "$RUN_ID" --log-failed > /tmp/babysit-failure.log
   ```

2. **Classify: real vs flaky.** Read the tail of the log.
   - **Likely FLAKY** when the failure looks infrastructural, not code:
     network errors (`ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `socket hang up`, `getaddrinfo`),
     timeouts (`timed out`, `Timeout - Async callback`), rate limits
     (`429`, `rate limit`), runner/setup failures (`The runner has received
     a shutdown signal`, `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`,
     `npm ERR! network`), or a test that passed on the previous SHA and whose
     failure is unrelated to the files this PR changed.
   - **REAL** otherwise: `error TS####`, ESLint errors, assertion failures
     (`expect(...)`, `AssertionError`), build/compile errors, lint rule
     violations, snapshot mismatches caused by this PR's diff.

3. **If FLAKY** → re-run the failed jobs instead of editing code:
   ```bash
   # Shell state does not cross a fence, and a value is never pasted into shell
   # source, so the failing-check block above recorded the run id and this reads it
   # back. A run id is digits; `gh run list` yields the literal null when no failing
   # run matched the check name, which is the reachable cause of an empty value.
   PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
   RECORDED_SHA=$(sed -n 1p "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-run" 2>/dev/null || true)
   RUN_ID=$(sed -n 2p "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-run" 2>/dev/null || true)
   case "$RUN_ID" in
     ''|*[!0-9]*)
       echo "No failing run id recorded. Re-run the failing-check block above; if it" >&2
       echo "recorded null, no failed run matches that check name." >&2
       exit 1 ;;
   esac
   # The id was resolved for one commit. A push since then makes it a run from an
   # earlier head, and re-running that tells the loop nothing about the code in flight.
   # Three things can be wrong here and each has its own remedy, so each says its own.
   if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ] || [ -z "$RECORDED_SHA" ]; then
     echo "No babysit target or no recorded head. Re-enter the loop with" >&2
     echo "/bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>, then re-run the failing-check block above." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   CURRENT_SHA=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid 2>/dev/null || true)
   if [ -z "$CURRENT_SHA" ]; then
     echo "Could not read the pull request head, so the recorded run cannot be shown to" >&2
     echo "be current. This is a gh failure, not a stale id: retry on the next wake-up." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   if [ "$RECORDED_SHA" != "$CURRENT_SHA" ]; then
     echo "The recorded run belongs to an earlier head. Re-run the failing-check block" >&2
     echo "above to resolve the run for the current one." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   gh run rerun "$RUN_ID" --failed
   ```
   Increment `flakyReruns[<check>]` in state. **Cap at 3 re-runs.** If a
   check is still failing after 3 flaky re-runs, escalate it to REAL (the
   "flaky" hypothesis was wrong) and diagnose as code, OR if the log clearly
   shows a persistent infra outage, pause and notify:
   `PushNotification`: "PR #<N>: <check> keeps failing on infrastructure
   errors after 3 re-runs — likely a CI outage, not your code."

4. **If REAL** → fix the root cause:
   - **Fingerprint** the failure: check name + first three distinct error
     signatures (`grep -oE '(FAIL [^ ]+|error TS[0-9]+|✖ [^ ]+|AssertionError|Error: [^\n]{1,80})'`).
   - **Consult state**: if this exact fingerprint reached
     `consecutiveFailures[<fingerprint>] == 3`, stop:
     `PushNotification`: "PR #<N>: <check> failed 3× with the same error after
     fix attempts. Manual intervention needed." Set `"paused": true` and stop
     scheduling.
   - **Otherwise** apply the smallest targeted fix, then **run the local gate
     before committing** (the detected test command, e.g. `<pm> test`). If the
     local gate fails, the fix is incomplete — keep diagnosing; do NOT commit
     or push until it's green. Then commit, push, and increment the
     fingerprint counter. Let CI re-run on the next wake-up.

   > **Mandatory local gate**: when a local test command was detected, it
   > must pass locally before any fix commit reaches the remote. A fix that
   > breaks other tests is worse than the original failure. (Skip only if the
   > repo has no detectable test command — `"localGate": "none"`.)

**Never** use `--no-verify`, `// @ts-ignore`, `any`, `eslint-disable`, or any
skip-hook flag to force a check green. Fix the root cause shown in the log.
If the project `CLAUDE.md` defines stricter rules, follow those too.

After pushing a fix, end the wake-up by scheduling the next one so CI has time
to re-run. When CI is entirely pending (no fail, no pass yet), do NOT
reschedule early — continue to the Bot Comment Handler first; only the
Termination Check decides to reschedule.

---

## Phase 2: Bot Comment Handler

```bash
# Shell state does not cross a fence, and the loop wakes into a fresh shell, so the
# target is read from the file loop entry wrote. Never resolve it again here: an
# argumentless `gh pr view` would silently retarget the current branch's PR.
PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/bymax-babysit-pr" 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  echo "No babysit target recorded. Re-enter the loop with /bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR#>." >&2
  exit 1
fi
REVIEW_COMMENTS=$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate)
ISSUE_COMMENTS=$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" --paginate)
```

### Detection
A comment is a **bot comment** when `user.type == "Bot"` OR `user.login` ends
with `[bot]` (case-insensitive). Skip comments authored by the babysit loop
itself (replies marked `<!-- babysit-reply -->`).

### Already-processed guard
Before evaluating a comment, skip it if its thread already has a reply
starting with `<!-- babysit-reply -->`, or if its ID is in
`processedCommentIds` in the state comment. The marker + ID list are the
idempotency keys; a restart must not re-process or lose memory.

### Human reviewer comments (`user.type == "User"`)
Fire a `PushNotification` summarising it (PR number, file, one-sentence
excerpt) and **take no other action**. Never reply, never resolve, never
auto-implement. The developer triages human feedback.

### Relevance triage (bot comments only)

| Tier | Examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **MUST FIX** | Security vuln, correctness bug, data-loss risk, race condition, missing auth check | Fix |
| **SHOULD FIX** | Measured perf regression, reachable missing error handling | Fix |
| **SKIP — nitpick** | "Consider extracting", "could be more readable", comment on self-evident code, defensive code for unreachable paths | Dismiss with reasoning |
| **SKIP — contradicts project rules** | Suggestion that violates the project's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` (architecture, typing, logging, dependency policy) | Dismiss citing the specific rule |
| **SKIP — new external service/dependency** | Suggests adding Redis, Kafka, a new SaaS, a heavyweight dep, etc. | Dismiss and `PushNotification` so the developer can decide |

When unsure between MUST FIX and SKIP, prefer SKIP and surface a
`PushNotification`. Never fix something whose correctness rationale you can't
articulate.

### Implementing a relevant comment
1. Revalidate all candidate comments against current HEAD and reproduce the accepted
   defects. Batch them by invariant, including evidence in the delivery probe.
2. Apply the smallest fix that addresses the concern.
3. Run the local gate (typecheck + relevant tests) before committing.
4. Commit: `fix: address <bot-name> review — <short summary>` (use the bot's
   `user.login`, e.g. Copilot, CodeRabbit, SonarCloud).
5. Complete the same autonomous delivery with both independent reviewers, declared
   gates and a receipt, then push. Do not create one commit/review per comment.
6. Reply on the thread with the marker:
   `<!-- babysit-reply --> Fixed in <commit-sha>: <one-sentence explanation>.`
7. Resolve the review thread via GraphQL — **follow the MANDATORY procedure in
   "Resolving review threads correctly" below. Never reuse a thread ID.**

### Dismissing an irrelevant comment
1. Reply with the marker and a **specific** reason citing the SKIP criterion:
   `<!-- babysit-reply --> Not applied: <criterion>. <one-sentence why>.`
2. Resolve the thread (see "Resolving review threads correctly" below).
3. Add the comment ID to `processedCommentIds` in state.

### Resolving review threads correctly (MANDATORY — read every time)

Thread-resolve failures in this environment are **never** a permission/token-scope
problem and **must not** stop the loop or trigger a "you need to re-auth" message.
They are caused by **passing a stale or wrong thread ID** (one remembered from an
earlier turn, another session, a different batch, or a GraphQL query that silently
returned empty data). The token can resolve threads — prove it with `viewerCanResolve`.

Do exactly this, **one `gh` call per message** (a batched failure cancels siblings):

1. **Re-fetch the threads FRESH, right now**, with an inline-literal query (the
   `-F owner=… -F repo=…` parameterized form sometimes mis-parses here — use literals).
   Always include `viewerCanResolve` and the inline-comment `databaseId`:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"<OWNER>",name:"<REPO>"){pullRequest(number:<N>){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id isResolved viewerCanResolve comments(first:1){nodes{databaseId}}}}}}}'
   ```
2. **Match each thread to its Copilot comment by `comments.nodes[0].databaseId`**
   (the inline review-comment id from `pulls/<N>/comments`), NOT by a remembered
   thread id. Thread IDs **change when the bot re-reviews a new commit** — the IDs
   from before your fix push are dead (`NOT_FOUND`).
3. If `viewerCanResolve` is `true` (it is, with push/triage/admin perms), resolve
   with the **freshly-fetched** id, one per message:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation{resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"<FRESH_PRRT_ID>"}){thread{isResolved}}}'
   ```
4. **Verify**: re-query and confirm every thread is `isResolved:true` before claiming
   it. Never write "resolved" to the state comment or to the user without this check.
5. **If `viewerCanResolve` is `false`** (only then): that is a genuine permission case —
   note it in state and surface it once; do not loop on it.

**Anti-hallucination rules for this whole phase:**
- The **source of truth** is a fresh `gh api`/`gh api graphql` read **this turn** — never
  memory, never a prior batch, never another PR/session. Re-fetch IDs/SHAs every time.
- Cite the **real** commit SHA (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) in replies — never invent one.
- Never dismiss a finding you have not actually reproduced/checked this turn.
- A failed `gh` call → diagnose it (re-fetch, inspect the error) and continue the loop;
  do **not** stop, do **not** claim a permission wall, do **not** ask the user to re-auth
  unless `viewerCanResolve:false` is actually observed.

### Cross-cutting bot rules
- Never re-process a thread that already has a `<!-- babysit-reply -->`.
- Push at most **one** bot-comment fix commit per wake-up so CI failures
  attribute cleanly.

---

## Phase 3: Termination Check

After Conflict Resolution, CI Monitoring, and the Bot Comment Handler, ask:

1. **CI**: every check is in the `pass` bucket — no `fail`, no `pending`
   (or `"ci": "none"`).
2. **Mergeable**: `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json mergeable -q .mergeable` is
   not `CONFLICTING`.
3. **Bot threads**: no open bot review thread
   (`reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false)`).
4. **Not paused**: state `"paused"` is `false`.

If all hold, fire:

```
PushNotification: "PR #<N> is ready to merge 🎉 (babysit-pr will not merge it for you)"

…and DO NOT schedule another wake-up. Record the termination timestamp in the
state comment so a future `/bymax-pr:babysit-pr` on the same PR exits immediately.

Otherwise:

```
ScheduleWakeup delaySeconds=<delay> prompt="/bymax-pr:babysit-pr <PR_NUMBER>"
```

(with `<delay>` chosen per "Scheduling the next wake-up") and end the wake-up.

## Hard rules (always)

- **Never merge** the PR and **never push to the base/default branch.**
- Never force-green a check (`--no-verify`, `@ts-ignore`, `any`,
  `eslint-disable`, skip hooks).
- Never push a fix without the local gate passing (when one is detectable).
- Never re-process an already-handled comment.
- Never auto-act on human comments — only notify.
- Always end a non-terminating wake-up with a `ScheduleWakeup`.
- Respect the project's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` if present.
- **Resolve review threads, don't excuse them.** A `FORBIDDEN`/`NOT_FOUND` on
  `resolveReviewThread` is a **stale-ID** symptom, not a permission wall — re-fetch the
  thread IDs fresh this turn (see "Resolving review threads correctly"), match by
  `databaseId`, resolve, and verify `isResolved:true`. Never stop the loop, never tell
  the user to re-auth, unless `viewerCanResolve:false` is actually observed.
- **Source of truth = a fresh read this turn.** Never act on IDs/SHAs/state remembered
  from a previous batch, turn, session, or another PR. Re-fetch before every write.
- **Never report success you didn't verify.** Confirm with a fresh read before writing
  "resolved"/"green"/"merged" to the state comment, a reply, or the user.
- **One `gh`/`git` mutation per message** — batched fallible calls cancel as a group.
