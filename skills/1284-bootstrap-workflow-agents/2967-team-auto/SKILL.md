# /team-auto — Approved plan to pull request

Read `../shared/workflow-contract.md` and `../shared/cross-model-review.md` first.

Never auto-trigger. The user must invoke `/team-auto`, with implementation authority for the scope recorded in
`docs/specs/<feature>/plan.md`. Ground it in the existing conversation; a new factual or test-detail
revision does not require ceremonial reapproval.

## Sentinel

Use `docs/specs/<feature>/.team-auto-active`.

1. If it exists and its modification time is less than two hours old, stop: another run may be
   active.
2. If it is at least two hours stale, record the stale recovery in `run.md`, remove it, and start.
3. Create it at start. Refresh its modification time at every stage transition and immediately
   before and after a command expected to exceed ten minutes.
4. Remove it on success, review failure, tool failure, degraded review, or deliberate stop. A hard
   process kill recovers through the stale rule.

The sentinel is only a concurrency guard. It is not approval or workflow state.

## State machine

1. **Preflight:** read the approved plan, repository instructions, git state, and `run.md`. Confirm
   no missing product, scope, trust or irreversible decision.
2. **Build:** invoke `/team-build` against that plan. Refresh the sentinel. Stop on an ungrounded
   scope/trust/irreversibility decision or a safety control.
3. **Review:** invoke `/team-review --implementation`. Apply consequential review gates and honor explicit review requests.
4. **Correct within budget:** return verified MUST-FIX to the retained owner. Use the shared maximum
   of 3 corrective rounds across build/test/review, including one reconsideration on a repeated
   failure signature. Re-run only affected checks; reuse valid exact evidence.
5. **Ship what is safe:** if clear, remove the sentinel and invoke `/team-ship`. It lands everything
   that passes readiness itself — commit, push, PR, and the merge once CI, review and the
   repository's required checks are green — then posts an FYI. It holds for a human only on the
   second tier (scheduled production release, irreversible data, credentials, external publishing,
   spend, direction). Do not stop here and report "ready to ship".

If the budget is exhausted, progress stops, workflow-created obstruction repeats, or a required
reviewer is unavailable without explicit accepted coverage, record the concrete blocker in `run.md`,
remove the sentinel, and stop. A second productive failure alone does not stop the run.

`/team-auto` stops at the second tier of `/team-ship` and cannot silently widen it.

## Authority

Grounded implementation judgment inside the approved plan is allowed and recorded. Stop for a
decision that changes product intent, scope, a hard constraint, a trust or correctness invariant,
or irreversible behavior. Never bypass destructive/protected-file/email/self-approval controls.
