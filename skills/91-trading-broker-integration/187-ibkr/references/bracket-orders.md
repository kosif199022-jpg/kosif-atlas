# Bracket Orders

The logic, the variants, the configuration surface, and the places the documentation stops.

A bracket looks like the simplest complex order in the API and is the one that produces the most
production incidents. The reason is that its behaviour is decided in four different places: your order
objects, the attached-order mechanism, the OCA relationship between the children, and the terminal's own
presets. Three of those four are invisible in your code.

## What a bracket actually is

Verbatim from IBKR: bracket orders "make use of the TWS API's **Attaching Orders** mechanism". A bracket
is not a distinct order type. It is:

- a **parent** order, plus
- **child** orders carrying `parentId = parent.orderId`, which the venue holds until the parent's
  condition is met, plus
- an **OCA relationship between the children**, so that one executing removes the other.

Everything else is configuration. Understanding it as "attached orders plus OCA" is what makes the
exceptions predictable instead of surprising.

The canonical structure: a BUY parent is bracketed by a high-side SELL limit (take profit) and a
low-side SELL stop (stop loss). A SELL parent by a low-side BUY limit and a high-side BUY stop.

## The transmit staging protocol

Three orders are sent as three separate `placeOrder` calls, which creates a window where the parent
could fill before its protections exist. IBKR's answer is `Order.transmit`:

- Parent and all children except the last: `transmit = False`. TWS receives them and holds them.
- **Last child**: `transmit = True`. TWS transmits it *and* all its predecessors.

Consequences that are not obvious:

- **The order of `placeOrder` calls matters.** The parent must be sent before children referencing it.
- **A failure mid-stage leaves untransmitted orders parked in TWS.** They are not live and not visible
  as working, but they exist. Reconcile with `reqOpenOrders()` rather than assuming a failed sequence
  left nothing behind.
- **A staged child shows a transient `Cancelled` before `PreSubmitted`.** This is an artifact of
  staging, not a venue cancellation. Emitting a real cancellation event on it corrupts your lifecycle.
  Confirm against `reqOpenOrders()` before believing it.
- **A validation failure on the parent kills the whole stage.** The classic sequence is `110` on the
  parent (price not conforming to the minimum increment), followed by a `135` ("Can't find order
  with ID") for each child, because their parent no longer exists *(observed behaviour: IBKR's
  published note for 135 documents failed cancels, not this cascade)*. Read the first error, not the
  loudest.

## IBKR's published sample is not a production recipe

The official sample sets `orderType`, `totalQuantity`, prices, `parentId` and `transmit`. It **does not
set `tif` on any leg**. An unset TIF means `DAY`.

That produces stop-loss and take-profit children that **expire at the session close**, leaving an open
position with no protections overnight. Copying the sample verbatim into a system that holds positions
across sessions is how naked overnight exposure gets shipped.

**Value the TIF explicitly on every leg.** Not because the default is wrong in every case, but because
an unvalued field is indistinguishable from an intent you never formed. The usual production shape is
`GTC` on the protective children, so the protections live exactly as long as the position can.

## TIF per leg: the decisions

| Leg | Common choice | Why, and what it costs |
|---|---|---|
| Parent | `DAY` | The entry opportunity is usually session-scoped. A `GTC` parent means an unfilled entry crosses session boundaries and can fill on a day whose thesis has expired |
| Parent | `GTC` | Chosen when the entry level is structural rather than intraday. Requires the session-boundary behaviour below to be understood |
| Children | `GTC` | Protections outlive the session. This is the safe default for anything held overnight |
| Children | `DAY` | Only correct for strictly intraday systems that flatten before the close, and only if the flattening is guaranteed |

**The GTC session-boundary caveat.** Where GTC is not native to the venue, IB simulates it: the order is
deactivated at session close and re-armed at the next open, described as transparent to the client.
What the order reports as while deactivated, and whether a periodic open-order reconciliation classifies
it as working during that window, is **not documented**. If your system reconciles on a timer and can
act on "this order is gone", measure this before trusting it. See `venue-questions-and-probes.md`.

**Terminal presets can override the TIF you set.** Error `10349` ("Order TIF was set to DAY based on
order preset") is the observable form. Related: `10233` ("Defaults were inherited from CASH preset
during the creation of this order"). The preset lives in the terminal GUI, not in your repository, and
it applies to API orders. Audit the presets of every terminal your bots connect to, and re-audit after
terminal upgrades.

## OCA: what the children actually do to each other

The children of a bracket are an OCA group. OCA semantics are documented and worth knowing exactly,
because they are frequently misapplied to problems they do not solve.

| `ocaType` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cancel all remaining orders, **with block** |
| 2 | Remaining orders **proportionately reduced in size**, with block |
| 3 | Remaining orders proportionately reduced in size, **no block** |

**"With block" is overfill protection**: only one order in the group is routed at a time, removing the
possibility of an overfill. That is a real safety property and the reason to prefer types 1 or 2 over 3.
Note that the terminal's API precautions include a "Bypass No Overfill Protection precaution for
destinations where implied natively" checkbox, so this interacts with the terminal layer too.

**Multiple OCA types cannot be used in a single OCA group.** Mixing them is a configuration error.

**Partial completion re-balances the group.** Verbatim: "Completion of one piece of the group order
causes cancellation of the remaining group orders while partial completion causes the group to
re-balance."

**The trap**: this is a *sibling* mechanism. It describes what happens among members of the OCA group
when one of *them* fills. It is not a parent-to-child mechanism, and the OCA documentation never
mentions `parentId`. Reaching for `ocaType` 2 or 3 to make children track a partially filled *parent*
does not address that problem. See the documented silences below.

## Trigger methods: the stop child can be built so it never fires

`Order.triggerMethod` decides what price event fires a simulated stop. It is compatible with some
security types and not others, and IBKR states the consequence plainly: **"If an incompatible
triggerMethod and secType are used in your API order, the order may never trigger."** No error, no
rejection, a protective leg that silently does not exist.

| Value | Method |
|---|---|
| 0 | Default for the instrument |
| 1 | Double bid/ask |
| 2 | Last |
| 3 | Double last |
| 4 | Bid/ask |
| 7 | Last or bid/ask |
| 8 | Mid-point |

| secType | Bid/ask-driven (1, 4, 8) | Last-driven (2, 3) | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| STK | yes | yes | Last (double bid/ask for OTC) |
| CFD | yes | yes | Last |
| CFD on index | yes | **n/a** | n/a |
| OPT | yes | yes | US: double bid/ask. Other: Last |
| FOP | yes | yes | Last |
| FUT | yes | yes | Last |
| COMBO | yes | yes | Last |
| CASH (spot FX) | yes | **n/a** | Bid/ask |
| CMDTY | yes | **n/a** | Last |
| WAR | yes | yes | Last |
| IOPT | yes | yes | Last |
| IND | **n/a** | yes | Conditions only |

(Method 7 is used only in iBot alerts.) Read the `n/a` cells as landmines. A last-driven trigger method on a spot FX or commodity stop is an
incompatible combination, and the documented outcome is an order that may never trigger.

**These methods apply only to stops IB simulates.** Where a stop variant is handled natively by the
venue, the specified trigger method is ignored. So the same setting can matter on one instrument and be
inert on another.

## Variants of the bracket

**1. Manual three-leg (`parentId` + `transmit`).** The canonical form above. Full control, full
responsibility. Use this for automation.

**2. Preset-driven attachment (`ptOrderType` / `slOrderType` = `"PRESET"`).** IBKR supports attaching a
profit taker and a stop loss by setting `ptOrderId`/`ptOrderType` and `slOrderId`/`slOrderType` to
`"PRESET"` on a single order object, with the child parameters taken from the terminal's Presets.

```python
# ibapi (raw TWS API) Order fields. NOT serialized by ib_async: there the
# assignment succeeds silently, nothing is transmitted, and the order goes
# out with no protective legs and no error.
order.ptOrderType = "PRESET"; order.ptOrderId = 10001
order.slOrderType = "PRESET"; order.slOrderId = 10002
```

**Do not use this in an automated system.** (And note it is an `ibapi` mechanism: `ib_async` does not
carry these fields, so under `ib_async` the assignments above are silently ignored, which is worse.) It moves the definition of your protective legs into
unversioned terminal configuration. The protection levels of a live strategy would then depend on a GUI
setting on one machine, changeable without a commit, invisible in review, and silently different across
environments.

**3. Explicit OCA on the children.** Assign `ocaGroup` and `ocaType` to the children yourself to choose
the reduction and block behaviour, rather than accepting whatever the implicit grouping does.

**4. Attached orders generally.** `parentId` is not limited to TP and SL. Any order can be attached to
any parent, including hedging legs and additional scaling exits. The bracket is one shape of a general
mechanism.

**4b. Hedging orders are the same mechanism under another name.** IBKR describes them as "similar to
Bracket Orders", with the same activation rule: "a child order is submitted only on execution of the
parent". Three shapes are documented, "an attached forex trade, Beta hedge, or Pair Trade", and the FX
case is the one an automated system meets first: buying a contract denominated outside your base
currency, with an attached FX order to convert enough base currency to cover it. The refusal codes are
their own family (`10007` invalid hedge type, `10009` invalid hedge ratio, `10010` invalid delta hedge
order, plus `377`-`380` and `393` for delta hedges), so a malformed hedge fails distinctly rather than
silently.

**4c. Adjustable stops modify the parent instead of transmitting a child.** Documented for "stop, stop
limit, trailing stop and trailing stop limit orders": "you set a trigger price that triggers a
modification of the original (or parent) order, instead of triggering order transmission". The fields
are `triggerPrice`, `adjustedOrderType`, and then whichever of `adjustedStopPrice`,
`adjustedStopLimitPrice`, `adjustedTrailingAmount` / `adjustableTrailingUnit` the target type needs.
This is a stop that upgrades itself, not a second order, so nothing new appears in your open-order
list when it fires: reconcile on the parent's changed fields.

**5. Trailing protective leg.** A `TRAIL` or `TRAILLMT` child instead of `STP`. The trail is maintained
server-side, so it survives your process dying, which is an argument for it and a reason to reconcile
its state rather than model it locally.

**6. AON brackets.** Constrained and documented: `10236` "Child has to be AON if parent order is AON",
and `10237` "All or None ticket can route entire unfilled size only". Whether AON is accepted at all is
per contract: check the `AON` token in `ContractDetails.orderTypes` before probing. See
`order-types-and-attributes.md`.

## The parent must exist before the child names it

IBKR documents a timing race in attached-order submission that has nothing to do with the transmit
flag: "in some cases it will be necessary to include a small delay of 50 ms or less after placing the
parent order for processing, before placing the child order. Otherwise the error '10006: Missing
parent order' will be triggered."

Two consequences for a staging sequence that fires all three legs in a tight loop:

- **`10006` is a staging-race symptom, not a configuration error.** Read it as "the child arrived
  before its parent was known", and retry that leg rather than rebuilding the bracket from scratch.
- **A partially staged bracket is the dangerous outcome.** The parent may be held while a child has
  been refused, so the recovery path is the same as for any mid-sequence failure: reconcile against
  `reqOpenOrders()` and cancel what you did not intend to leave behind. What IBKR does *not* document
  is the atomicity of the final transmitting leg being rejected, so do not assume the venue rolls the
  batch back for you.

## What the documentation does not say

Two questions, both load-bearing for correctness. The API reference answers neither; the bracket
page was checked directly rather than inferred from a search result, and its silence is real. An
IBKR staff answer settles the first at documentation grade (below); the second stays open.

**Do children activate on a partial parent fill?** If children become live at nominal size while the
parent is only partly filled, the protective legs can be larger than the position they protect, and an
execution on them opens a position in the opposite direction rather than closing one.

**Does TWS resize children to the parent's cumulative fill?** If it does not, the client must, on the
fill event path, accepting a race between the fill and the correction.

Both are settled by the same measurement: drive a paper bracket parent to a partial fill and read the
children's status and quantity. Partial fills are hard to provoke deliberately on paper, so the
practical route is to log `filled` and `remaining` on every fill event and read the children's state
against the next real partial fill. Until measured, treat the hazard as open and record which of your
decisions depend on the answer.

**Do not resolve this from a forum post.** Community answers on this question contradict each other,
and at least one widely repeated claim cannot be located on the page it is attributed to.

## Protecting a position when partial fills are possible and AON is not

Some contract classes refuse every native all-or-none mechanism. FX CFDs are the measured example
(EUR.USD CFD, paper, what-if per shape, each with a same-session US-stock contrast, 2026-08-13;
availability boxes retrieved the same day from the interactivebrokers.co.uk order-type pages):

- `allOrNone` is refused with the undocumented `10257` ("The 'All or None' order attribute may not
  be specified for this order") on every order type, while the same shapes are accepted on AAPL.
  IBKR's availability box agrees: AON is Stocks, ETFs, Options, Bonds, EFPs, US products only.
- `tif=FOK` is refused with `201` ("The time-in-force FOK is invalid for this combination of
  exchange and security type"), and AAPL receives the identical refusal. IBKR documents FOK as
  **Options Only, US Products Only**: the restriction is the product matrix, not the CFD class.
- `minQty=totalQuantity`, the one other attribute whose semantics forbid a partial, is refused with
  the undocumented `10256` ("The 'Minimum Quantity' order attribute may not be specified for this
  order") on the FX CFD and on AAPL alike.
- `tif=IOC` is **accepted**, despite being absent from the declared `orderTypes` (the declaration
  under-reports TIFs; see `order-types-and-attributes.md`). IOC is not protection: IBKR's own
  worked example fills 400 of 1,000 and cancels the rest. It bounds the remainder's lifetime, not
  the fill's divisibility.

On those classes there is **no order attribute that forbids partial fills**, so the protection has
to live in your code.

The two possible venue behaviours on a partially filled parent are both hazardous, which is the
useful realisation: whichever turns out true for your account, the same component is required.

| If children... | A 40%-filled parent means... | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| activate immediately at nominal size | protective legs larger than the position | a triggered leg over-closes and, on a non-reduce-only class, opens the difference in the opposite direction |
| are held until the parent fills completely | a real position with no resting protection | partially naked exposure until the parent completes or dies |

What the documentation actually supports, assembled from the IBKR Mobile users' guide and from an
IBKR staff answer on the Campus "Placing Complex Orders" API lesson (the API reference pages
themselves say nothing):

- *"The order will be created, but will not be submitted until the parent order fills."* (both the
  profit taker and the stop loss)
- *"Once the parent order fills, the opposite side profit taker and stop loss orders are triggered."*
- Stated outright by IBKR support on the Campus API lesson (comment reply, 2023-10-11, on
  `campus/trading-lessons/python-complex-orders/`): *"the system will keep the child order 'on hold'
  until its parent fills. Once the parent order is completely filled, its children will
  automatically become active."*
- The children use *"the same order quantity as the parent"*.
- And a linguistic tell worth its own bullet: in the very same documents, wherever IBKR means to
  include partial fills it says so explicitly ("if the first leg fills **or partially fills**" for
  LMT+MKT; "if an order is **partially filled**" for OCA). The bracket sections say only "fills".

The reading, no longer an inference: children stay unsubmitted until the parent fills
**completely**, at nominal size, which is then exactly the position's size. The support answer
states it; the guide's wording and the linguistic tell corroborate it. Under that reading the
mis-sized-children hazard largely dissolves, and the real hazards move elsewhere:

- **the unprotected window**: a partially filled parent is a real position with no resting
  protection until the remainder fills;
- **the dying parent**: if a partially filled parent is cancelled or expires (a `DAY` parent at the
  close), its attached children are cancelled with it, leaving the partial position permanently
  naked with no order resting anywhere.

The statement lives in a dated support answer rather than in the API reference, and nothing anywhere
states whether children are ever resized, so grade the reading `DOCUMENTED (support-stated)` and
still measure it for your account: log `filled`/`remaining` on every fill event and read the
children's live quantity against the next real partial. The measurement decides what the handler
below does; the handler itself is required under every reading.

The design:

1. **A handler on the parent's fill events** (`execDetails` is authoritative): on every increase of
   the filled quantity, ensure protection matches the real position size: resize resting children
   (a `placeOrder` with the **same `orderId`** and the new `totalQuantity`, the documented modify
   semantics; already-filled portions cannot be modified), or, if children turn out to be held until
   the complete fill, place protection for the filled portion. On a parent that dies with
   `filled > 0` (cancel, expiry), place protection immediately: its children die with it.
2. **Idempotence from the venue position, never from accumulated events**: recompute the children's
   target size from the signed venue position each time, so a lost or duplicated event cannot corrupt
   the correction.
3. **The race window is declared, not denied**: between the partial fill and the modify, the children
   are mis-sized for a sub-second window. Damage requires price to touch a protective leg inside that
   window, i.e. a violent gap. Without an AON-class attribute this window is irreducible; document it
   as an accepted risk rather than pretending it away.
4. **Periodic reconciliation as the net**: compare resting children against the position on a timer;
   divergence triggers correction. This covers a dead handler, a lost race, and restarts.
5. **The sibling direction is IBKR's job**: between SL and TP, re-balancing on a partial fill of one
   child is documented OCA behaviour ("partial completion causes the group to re-balance"). Your
   handler only owns the parent-to-children direction.
6. **Probability is a mitigation, not a substitute**: against deep underlying liquidity, retail-size
   orders rarely fill partially; large sizes and thin sessions change that. Sizing policy reduces the
   frequency; only the handler bounds the damage.

## Failure modes to design against

- **Naked overnight positions**: `DAY` children expiring at the session close while the position lives
  on. Fixed by valuing TIF explicitly.
- **Orphaned protective legs**: the position closes by some other path (manual intervention, an
  opposing signal, a partial close), and the children rest on a flat contract. Fixed by a
  **residual-child reaper**: on a position-closed event for a now-flat contract, cancel any bracket
  children still working. Protections must live exactly as long as the position.
- **Orphaned children on a position that never opened**: if a preset mutates the children and they
  transmit while the parent never fills, GTC children rest for a position that does not exist. A reaper
  hooked on position-closed cannot collect them, because no position was ever opened. Reconcile working
  orders against positions, not only against closes.
- **Netted accounts and the not-reduce-only rule**: IBKR CFD orders are not reduce-only, and positions
  net per contract at the account level. A protective leg firing on a netted account with no position
  opens a new one in the opposite direction. Never derive a closing side from the sign of an
  absolute-valued quantity.
- **Partial closes on a shared `conId`** emit a position-modified event rather than position-closed, so
  a reaper keyed only on close events does not run.
- **Price collapse between legs**: rounding a stop and an entry to the same price, or to prices less
  than one increment apart. Round protective legs *away* from the entry and force at least one
  increment of clearance.

## Bracket checklist

- [ ] TIF valued explicitly on every leg, never left to default
- [ ] Protective children `GTC` if the position can survive a session
- [ ] Every price snapped to the increment in force at that price band, from the **order** contract's
      market rule, not to `minTick` alone
- [ ] Protective legs at least one increment clear of the entry, rounded away from it
- [ ] `triggerMethod` compatible with the instrument's `secType`, or left at 0
- [ ] `AON` presence confirmed in `ContractDetails.orderTypes` before it is set
- [ ] `ocaType` chosen deliberately, with block unless there is a reason not to
- [ ] Transient `Cancelled` during staging not treated as a real cancellation
- [ ] The staging sequence reconciled against `reqOpenOrders()` after any mid-sequence failure, and
      `10006` on a child treated as a retryable staging race rather than a broken bracket
- [ ] Residual-child reaper on position-closed, plus a working-orders-versus-positions reconciliation
      for children whose position never opened
- [ ] Terminal presets audited for every terminal the system connects to, and after upgrades
- [ ] Behaviour on partial parent fill measured for your account, or explicitly recorded as unmeasured
      with the decisions that depend on it
