description: >-
  Audits CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/SKILL.md instruction files against current repo state, catches claims that have gone stale (a renamed path, a dropped command, a policy that changed) before they get trusted or acted on, and resolves contradictions between layered instruction files (root vs nested, SKILL.md vs its parent AGENTS.md) down to one explicit kept version instead of leaving both to stand. Use before trusting or propagating any instruction-file claim you haven't personally re-checked, whenever onboarding a repo's docs for the first time, right after a refactor/rename/policy change that could invalidate what's documented, or whenever two instruction files (or an instruction file and the actual repo) say different things about the same fact. Trigger phrases: 'audit the docs', 'is AGENTS.md still accurate', 'clean up CLAUDE.md', 'these instructions contradict each other', 'refactor the AGENTS.md files'.

# docs-hygiene

## Invariant

A claim in an instruction file (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/SKILL.md) is NEVER trusted or propagated forward without being re-verified against current repo state first. When a checked claim is UNAMBIGUOUS — source and doc plainly disagree on a checkable fact — the instruction file is FIXED IN PLACE, in the same pass: edit the file itself. Do not merely flag it, and do not convert it into a question for the user to answer instead of acting. Flagging instead of fixing is reserved for the genuinely ambiguous case (see "Fixing what you find" below) — it is a fallback, not an equal alternative. When two or more layered instruction files disagree with each other, the audit ALWAYS resolves the disagreement to one explicit kept version — it NEVER leaves the contradiction standing for the next reader (human or agent) to trip over and silently pick a side.

<!-- MEASURED, one-armed probe (the control agent errored out, so this is not
     a controlled A/B — treat it as a strong signal, not a proof): given a
     repo whose CLAUDE.md contradicted its own source on two clearly
     checkable facts (claimed x-api-key auth / no integration suite; the
     source used JWT bearer / an integration suite existed), the unaided
     model read the source, caught BOTH contradictions, and tabled them for
     the user in the same pass — genuinely good triage. What it did NOT do
     is edit CLAUDE.md. It held a principled prior against touching an
     instruction file during a docs task and said so explicitly. So
     "flagging" a contradiction is already the base-model default — a
     future contributor does not need to add more prose telling the model
     to flag things; it already will. What earns this plugin its slot is
     the opposite instruction: FIX unambiguous contradictions in place,
     don't just flag them. Don't re-inflate the "or explicitly flag" half
     back to parity with fixing — that regresses toward what the unaided
     model already does for free. -->

Everything below exists to keep that true.

## Why this matters

For an AI agent that reads instruction files on every request, stale information doesn't just mislead once the way a stale doc misleads a skimming human — it actively **poisons the context**, because the agent has no built-in skepticism toward a file that's checked into the repo and formatted like every other doc. A human skimming CLAUDE.md brings background doubt ("is this still true?"); an agent treats every claim in an instruction file as authoritative on every single read, so one stale sentence misleads on every subsequent turn until something forces a re-check.

This is the exact same failure shape as a GitOps controller that stays green — `Ready: True` — while quietly reconciling against a stale artifact, because the controller never re-diffs its own claim of freshness against what's actually live. An instruction file fails the same way: it sits there looking authoritative — present, well-formatted, checked in — while the fact it asserts has silently diverged from reality. **Present and well-formatted is not evidence of current.** That gap is exactly why this audit exists as its own repeatable step instead of a one-time write nobody revisits.

Two real, in-repo instances of this exact failure, not hypotheticals — one of them git-verifiable history rather than present-tense (a present-tense claim about a table that gets rebuilt every time a plugin ships is exactly the kind of claim guaranteed to go stale again, so this cites the fixed incident, not the live table):

- This marketplace's own root `README.md`, historically: right before the fix commit `1d6d73f`, its plugin table named only 2 of the 11 plugins then registered in `marketplace.json` (`graveyard` and `tailscale-wif`) — present, well-formatted, and quietly wrong since roughly the third plugin was added, with nothing re-checking the README's claim against the manifest it was describing. The fix commit `1d6d73f` caught it, rebuilt the table from `marketplace.json`, and added a permanent regression guard (`evals/cheap/run.sh`, the "README documents every registered plugin" check) so every plugin registered in `marketplace.json` must be named in `README.md` or the cheap tier fails closed. That fix landed *before this plugin existed* — verify it yourself with `git show 1d6d73f^:README.md` vs `git show 1d6d73f^:.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- `plugins/fleet-playbook-curator/README.md` asserted a "Freshly scaffolded... intentionally RED" status long after its evals were written and green across all three tiers — stale status text asserting something demonstrably false, in a plugin whose entire purpose is refusing to assert uncited claims. (That plugin's README now records the correction in place rather than quietly editing it away — a worked example of the "explicitly flagged" half of this skill's invariant.)

## When to use this

- Before trusting or acting on any instruction-file claim you have not personally re-checked this session — a path, a command, a policy statement.
- Reading a repo's instruction files for the first time (onboarding).
- Right after any refactor, rename, move, or policy change that could invalidate something documented.
- Whenever two instruction files in the same repo could plausibly disagree — a root `AGENTS.md` vs a nested per-package/per-plugin `AGENTS.md`, a `SKILL.md` vs the `AGENTS.md` above it, or `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` symlink targets that have drifted from what they point at.
- On explicit request: "audit," "clean up," "refactor," or "is this still true" applied to any instruction file.

## Staleness-detection heuristic

This is a per-claim checklist applied the moment a claim is about to be trusted or propagated — a fast triage, not a multi-step workflow.

1. **Does the claim have a checkable target at all?** A pure policy/judgment statement ("PRs require review") or an invariant ("X must never happen") isn't "stale" in this sense unless it asserts a *fact about current repo state* — "PRs require review, enforced by branch protection" IS checkable, because of that enforcement clause. Skip verification for claims with no checkable target; staleness detection is for factual/structural claims, not policy or judgment.

2. **Tier by drift risk, check in this order, stop once satisfied:**
   - **Paths** (highest risk — a rename or move breaks these silently and completely): does the named file/directory exist, right now, at that exact path? One `ls`/`rg`/`find` call. If a claim says "X lives in `path/to/file`," confirm the path resolves before trusting anything built on top of it.
   - **Commands** (second-highest): does the named command actually exist and do what's claimed — check the real script/Makefile target/CLI entry, not just whether the words sound plausible. `grep '"scriptname"' package.json`, `which`, or reading the actual script.
   - **Behavior/architecture claims** ("X always happens when Y"): spot-check against the real code path with one grep/read — verify against the code, never against the doc's own restatement of itself.
   - **Domain-concept/vocabulary claims** ("we call it a 'workspace,' not an 'org'"): lowest drift risk, but check when something else already smells off — e.g. the code visibly uses different terminology than the doc.

3. **Freshness cross-check:** when available cheaply, compare the instruction file's last-touched date/commit against the code path it describes — `git log -1 --format=%ai -- <doc>` vs `git log -1 --format=%ai -- <path it names>`. If the code changed more recently than the paragraph describing it, treat that paragraph as suspect by default — verify it explicitly rather than extending it good faith.

## Fixing what you find

This ties directly back to the invariant's "fix it in place" clause. The two cases below are NOT equal alternatives — unambiguous is the default outcome for most claims this audit finds; ambiguous is the narrow exception.

- **Unambiguous fix** (the default) — source and doc plainly disagree on a checkable fact, and there's one obvious current replacement: the old path/command literally doesn't exist, or the actual code states the real behavior (the real auth scheme, the real test suite that exists) in a way that flatly contradicts the doc. **Edit the instruction file in place, in the same pass — this includes CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/SKILL.md themselves.** Editing those files is this plugin's whole job, not something to route around by writing the correction somewhere else instead. Do not merely flag it in a table, a comment, or a "known issues" note. Do not convert it into a question for the user ("should I fix this?") — that's a way of deferring an unambiguous fix, not surfacing a real ambiguity, and a flagged-but-unfixed stale claim is still a stale claim on the next read.
- **Ambiguous fix** (the narrow exception — flagging instead of fixing is appropriate ONLY here) — unclear which of several candidates is correct, or it's a genuine judgment call about intent that no grep or read settles: do not guess, and do not edit. Surface it explicitly — name the specific claim, the specific contradiction with observed reality, and ask which is correct — rather than silently picking one or leaving it untouched "for later."

## Resolving contradictions across layered instruction files

This is a **separate, heavier procedure** from the single-claim staleness-checking above, because it means comparing multiple files against each other, not just one file against the repo. Load [`references/refactoring-workflow.md`](references/refactoring-workflow.md) **only when this audit finds — or is asked to find — two or more instruction files that could conflict**: a root `AGENTS.md` plus one or more nested `AGENTS.md`/`SKILL.md` files, or `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` that have drifted apart from what they symlink to. For a single-file, single-claim staleness check, the inline heuristic above is sufficient — don't load the reference file for that case.

## What this isn't

- **Not fleet-playbook-curator.** That plugin builds and automatically maintains a new, separate, cron-driven index repo describing a *glob of other repos* from the outside, via `repo@sha:path` citations, and explicitly declares `source-of-truth: false` — a router that says "go check the real repo," and it never edits the fleet members' own instruction files. docs-hygiene is the inverse: it audits and edits the actual `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`SKILL.md` files that already live *inside* one target repo, in place, on demand — a human or agent invokes it in the moment, no cron, no separate repo, no citation-ledger schema. Its whole point is to make those files themselves trustworthy — the opposite of fleet-playbook-curator, which is designed to never be mistaken for the source of truth in the first place. Want a standing, automated, cross-repo index that watches a fleet and stays current on its own? That's fleet-playbook-curator. Want the instruction files already sitting in this one repo fixed, de-duplicated, and de-contradicted right now? That's this skill. Asked to do this across many repos, docs-hygiene runs as N independent per-repo passes — it has no glob/fleet discovery, no cron, no citation schema, and doesn't try to grow one.
- **Not plugin-factory.** plugin-factory generates a brand-new plugin's `SKILL.md`/`AGENTS.md` skeleton at scaffold time, scoped to this one marketplace repo. docs-hygiene audits *existing* instruction files, at any later time, in any repo — general-purpose, not authoring-time, not marketplace-specific. It is not "the thing that fixes what plugin-factory generated" — it fixes any instruction file, generated by anything, any time after it's written.

## Keep it portable

The procedure above is prose, grep, and `git log` judgment — no harness-specific mechanism. It works identically whether invoked as a Claude Code skill, run by hand, or run under any other agent harness that can read a repo and run shell commands.
