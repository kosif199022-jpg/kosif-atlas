# Executive Self-Monitoring Skill

## In short

- Before working, open the artifact that defines the work - the plan, the
  ticket, the spec, the ADR, the agreement the request refers to - and read
  it. Do not work from memory or from the request's paraphrase of it.
- Quote the gate from it: the line that says what done means.
- Anything that does not serve that gate - a fix noticed on the way, a
  teammate's "while you are in there" - is out of this change. Name it and
  leave it.
- Write the `[PLAN CHECK]` block: Plan, Gate, Drift, Decision.

**Purpose:** A short, honest self-check that keeps effort aligned with what the
**plan** actually asks for. It does **not** force a decision or block work — the
plan defines the work; this is just a moment to notice when you're about to
invest time in something the plan didn't ask for.

**Key idea:** the check is not "reflect harder." It's **go read the plan.** Drift
is only visible against an external artifact, so every activation touches one.

## When to Activate

Not on every task — reserve it for where drift actually happens:
- Long or multi-step tasks, and loop iterations (ReAct / Reflexion / agent loops)
- Before opening a new line of investigation, tuning, or "quick optimization"
- Whenever a result tempts you to chase a number instead of the objective

## Core Protocol (artifact-anchored)

1. **Name the plan.** State which artifact defines the active work — a plan doc
   (e.g. `PLAN-*.md`), a roadmap entry, an issue/ticket, a task spec, or the
   user's original request. If you can't name it, that is itself the finding —
   stop and find it before continuing.
2. **Quote the objective + the gate.** Copy the one line that states the goal and
   the specific gate — the test, metric, acceptance criterion, or condition that
   defines success. Success is defined *outside* your own judgment — anchor to
   it, don't paraphrase from memory.
3. **Compare.** Do your last few actions serve that objective and move toward
   that gate? Name any tangent, attractive optimization, or secondary
   exploration pulling away from it.
4. **Calibrate effort.** Does the depth match what the gate needs — would a quick
   check settle it, or is exhaustive work genuinely required?
5. **Decide, don't force.** Continue, gently refocus, or adjust course. The plan
   is the authority; if the plan and your instinct disagree, the plan wins or the
   plan gets explicitly revised — not silently drifted from.

## Common drift signatures

Patterns that reliably pull work away from the plan, regardless of domain:
- **Chasing a proxy instead of the gate** — a passing smoke test, a green build,
  or a better-looking number is not the objective unless the plan says it is.
  Measure the thing the change actually affects.
- **Restoring something that was reverted** because it once produced a better
  result — the reason it was reverted still applies until shown otherwise.
- **Declaring done on an unverified assumption** — closing on "this should
  work" or on a zero/no-op result without checking empirically.
- **Re-litigating a documented dead end** — if the project keeps a decision log,
  dead-ends ledger, or ADRs, check it before reopening a settled question.
- **"While I'm here" scope creep** — refactors, cleanups, or improvements the
  plan didn't ask for, however cheap they look.
- **Scope shrink** — the mirror image: delivering the tractable subset of what
  the plan asks and reporting it as done. The coverage-self-monitoring skill
  tracks the parts; here the check is that the gate you quote is the plan's,
  not a smaller one you substituted.
- **Investigation without an exit condition** — digging into a curiosity with no
  stated question the plan needs answered.

Projects can extend this list with their own recurring patterns (a `CLAUDE.md`
note or a project rule is a good place).

## Integration

Insert naturally — a brief internal executive voice, not a mechanical
checklist. Write it as a markdown list in the message, **not inside a fenced
code block**. Fences do not wrap. No blank line inside the block. The marker,
field names and decision stay in English (hooks parse them); the rest is in
the language of the turn.

**Write the block. Do not announce writing it.** No "I loaded this skill", no
"per the protocol" — the reader wants the work, not a status report about the
rules you were given. And the `[PLAN CHECK]` line opens the block, always: four
fields with no marker above them are prose, and they read as a turn that never
re-opened the plan.

[PLAN CHECK]
- Plan: <the artifact that defines the active work, named>
- Gate: <the line from it that defines success, quoted>
- Drift: none | <what is pulling away from that gate>
- Decision: continue | refocus | revise-plan

`Plan` names an artifact, not a memory — if you cannot name one, that is the
finding, and the decision is to go find it. `Gate` is quoted from that artifact
rather than paraphrased. `Drift: none` and `Decision: continue` go together: if
nothing is pulling away, there is nothing to correct.

Then continue normal work. Keep it short and honest — the value is the re-read,
not the ritual. If you find yourself writing "✓ still aligned" without opening
the plan, you have skipped the only step that matters.
