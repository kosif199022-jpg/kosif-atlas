# Memory Guide

Where a fact BELONGS, how to compress it, and what never gets written at all. Cited by every `/memory-sync`
batch agent in Phase 2, before it edits anything.

Prompting-quality problems (role framing, duplicate reminders, scattered CAPS, vague adjectives) are a separate
axis, run in the same Phase 2 pass - see `references/prompting-guide.md`.

## Memory itself - five rules ABOVE the layers

Applied BEFORE the routing below: a row deleted under rule 1 or 2 is never merged, moved or compressed.

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1. Context OUTRANKS memory, always | Auto-loaded context - the CLAUDE.md family, rule files, an agent's own definition, a skill body - is AUTHORITATIVE over every memory row. A memory restating any of it is DELETED, not reworded: the context loads regardless, so the copy is only a second place to go stale. PROOF OF DUPLICATION IS A QUOTED LINE from the auto-loaded file; a guess is not proof, and an unproven duplicate STAYS. Memory CONTRADICTS context -> context wins, the memory goes; if the memory looks the more current of the two, that is a finding about the CONTEXT - report it, never keep both |
| 2. Memory holds FACTS, never EVENTS | An event - what a run did, what a session decided, something measured on a date, a status, a run id, a branch name, a task's state - has a shelf life of about a DAY. Within that day it is either PROMOTED into a durable fact (what the event TAUGHT, written so it applies to work nobody has met yet) or DELETED. A row still reading as a NARRATIVE of something that happened is deleted whatever its age. Durable = outlives the task that produced it: a rule, a trap, a contract, a threshold with its reason. Promotion keeps the lesson and drops the chronology - an incident is identified by WHAT happened and WHERE, never by WHEN. Dates otherwise: the project's own date convention governs, cited; never invent a second one |
| 3. ONE subject, ONE memory | Two rows about the same SUBJECT - matched on subject, not on similar wording - merge into one. After a merge the directory's index file is REWRITTEN and every `[[link]]` pointing at the merged-away file is REPOINTED; a dangling link is exactly the rot this sweep exists to remove |
| 4. The two memory KINDS | A SESSION/PROJECT memory dir loads for the main session; a PER-AGENT store loads ONLY when that agent runs. So a fact EVERYONE needs does not belong in one agent's store - it belongs in a rule, and the sweep REPORTS that promotion rather than performing it (it is a responsibility change). A fact sitting in TWO agents' stores is a rule candidate by the same argument - REPORT it. Both kinds get the same treatment, and each directory's index is rewritten to match exactly what survives |
| 5. A per-agent store is born where the SESSION ran | Per-agent memory resolves against the SESSION'S CWD, not the repo root, so a whole new store appears wherever a session was started - a subdirectory run silently grows one nobody reads. So every run ENUMERATES the stores across the WHOLE tree, never from a roster, and CLASSIFIES each with its evidence. ORPHAN is PROVEN, never guessed: the store sits inside a tree the project itself declares REGENERABLE RUNTIME or ARCHIVED - one of its own excluded/runtime paths, the set the sweep already lists as EXCLUDED - so nothing reads it and its whole tree is disposable; an EMPTY store directory is an orphan on sight. A directory that IS or COULD BE a working root - a live task workspace, a module root, anything a session would plausibly `cd` into - is LIVE, swept like any other store and NEVER removed. UNDECIDED is a legitimate verdict and it means REPORT, not delete: an unswept store costs disk, a wrongly deleted one costs knowledge. SALVAGE BEFORE REMOVAL - every row in a doomed store is judged by the same bar as the rest of memory (rules 1-4); a survivor MOVES into the LIVE store of the SAME agent, MERGED with any row on that subject (rule 3) instead of added beside it, and that store's index is rewritten; everything else dies with the store. Then remove the STORE DIRECTORY ONLY - never its parent, never a sibling, never the workspace, report or archive that contains it |

## The layers

Ordered BROAD-to-NARROW: the first rows reach every project, the last only one file. A fact lives in exactly ONE
of them, and dedup picks the NARROWEST layer that still covers every consumer - the LAST matching row, not the first.

| Layer | What belongs here | What NEVER belongs here |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Global CLAUDE.md (user-level) | Preferences that hold across EVERY project: tone, delegation style, universal safety rules. OUT OF SCOPE for this flow - a fact that belongs here is REPORTED to the user, never written | Anything naming this repo, its paths, stacks or agents |
| Global rules dir (user-level) | Cross-project prohibitions and practices, one table row each. OUT OF SCOPE for this flow - REPORT it to the user, never edit `~/.claude/**` | Project-specific facts, however true |
| Project root CLAUDE.md (also `CLAUDE.local.md`, root `AGENTS.md`) | Repo-wide orientation: what this project IS, its structure, its commands, its cross-cutting decisions. Machine-local or personal variants go to `CLAUDE.local.md` | Details that hold only inside one subtree; anything a rule file owns; task state |
| Nested CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (any depth) | Facts true ONLY inside that subtree - its build, its conventions, its entry points. Wins over the root for its own subtree | Repo-wide facts (they belong at the root); a copy of what the root already says |
| Project rules | An always-on constraint with a scoped `paths:` glob: prohibitions, house practices, numbered and citable | Narrative, tutorials, anything unscoped that should be repo-wide orientation |
| Conventions | Stable house STYLE and reference patterns - how things are shaped here | Constraints that must fire on every edit (those are rules); public documentation |
| Memory dir (session/project) | Cross-session facts a future session would otherwise re-derive: environment quirks, failure history | Events and task state (rule 2); anything the auto-loaded context already states (rule 1) |
| Agent memory store (per-agent) | Cross-run facts only THAT agent re-derives, one line with its cause - it loads only when the agent runs | A fact any other seat needs: that is a rule candidate, REPORTED not moved (rule 4) |
| Agent file | What THIS agent owns, its boundary, its output shape, its handoffs | Project rules restated; another agent's surface; a procedure a skill owns |
| Skill file | A named multi-step PROCEDURE and its phases | Standing constraints (rules own those); facts the agents already carry |

Not memory at all - never edited by this flow: source code (read-only evidence), public docs (owned by a doc
flow), operational task state (changes hourly), secrets, build output, git-ignored scratch.

## Routing a new fact

```
Is it an EVENT - session/task state, a run, a decision, a measurement (rule 2)?
  -> promote to the durable fact it taught, else DO NOT SAVE; delete it if found in memory.
Is it true in every project, not just this one?
  -> always-on constraint  -> global rules dir (user-level: REPORT to the user, never edit)
  -> preference or style   -> global CLAUDE.md (user-level: REPORT to the user, never edit)
Is it a constraint that must fire on every relevant edit?
  -> scoped to a path subset -> project rules, with the narrowest paths: glob
  -> genuinely repo-wide     -> project rules with no glob
Is it about ONE subtree only?
  -> that subtree's nested CLAUDE.md (or its AGENTS.md, where the repo uses that family)
Is it about how one AGENT behaves or what it owns?
  -> that agent file
Is it a named multi-step procedure a human invokes?
  -> that skill file
Is it a repo-wide orientation fact (structure, command, decision)?
  -> project root CLAUDE.md; machine-local / personal -> CLAUDE.local.md; root AGENTS.md where the repo uses it
Is it a quirk or failure a future session would re-discover the hard way?
  -> memory dir, one line, with its cause; needed by ONE agent only -> that agent's memory store (rule 4)
Otherwise
  -> it is not worth a line. Drop it.
```

## Dedup - one canonical home, never two copies

A fact repeated in two layers is a future contradiction: one copy gets updated, the other becomes a lie that
still loads.

| Step | Rule |
|------|------|
| 1. Detect | Same fact, exact or paraphrased, in more than one file. A paraphrase counts |
| 2. Choose the canonical home | NARROWEST layer that still covers every consumer: a subtree fact goes to that subtree's file, not the root. Tie -> the more AUTHORITATIVE layer, total order: rule > CLAUDE.md > convention > agent/skill file > memory dir |
| 3. Replace | The copy becomes a POINTER: `canonical: <file> - <section>`. Never a shortened restatement |
| 4. Cross-batch | Canonical home in another batch's file -> REPORT it, do not edit a foreign file |

| IS a duplicate | NOT a duplicate |
|----------------|-----------------|
| The same rule stated again, in any wording | A narrower fact adding real detail the canonical version lacks |
| A pointer that also repeats the content it points at | A documented EXCEPTION to a general rule, stated where the exception applies |
| Two files both listing the same commands or paths | A subtree overriding the repo-wide default for itself |

---

## Compression patterns

| Pattern | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Prose -> imperative one-liner | "When you add a new service you also have to remember to register it in the compose file CI uses, otherwise the integration tests will silently not pick it up" | "New service -> register in the CI compose file, or ITs skip it" |
| Prose -> table row | "Avoid X. Do Y instead. Because Z." | `\| X \| Y \| Z \|` |
| Merge entries | Three paragraphs about the same subject in three sections | One table, one row each |
| Drop rationale, keep the rule | "Because the schema is shared across parallel workers and a per-method reset would race, the DB is reset per class" | "Test DB resets per CLASS - parallel tests share the schema" |
| Drop filler | "It is important to note that the build must pass before merging" | "Build must pass before merge" |
| Example -> reference | 15 lines of inlined sample code | "pattern: `<path>`" |

Rationale survives only when it CHANGES a decision at the edge (when to break the rule). Rationale that merely
explains why the rule is sensible is filler.

## Never added vs wanted

The DELETE classes (generic knowledge) and the KEEP classes (domain facts only this repo can tell) are owned by
`references/hard-sync.md`, Pass B, with the per-line discriminator. Not restated here.

Add gate - a new line enters ONLY if ALL hold: non-obvious for a competent model, specific to this project,
verified against a real source, and its absence costs a real failure. It must EARN its line by displacing another.

---

## Line-budget discipline

Owned by the skill's own `## NON-GROWTH` section - baseline, DELETE-before-ADD order, longest-first,
traceability, authority on conflict, Edit-only bottom-up. Read it there; it is not restated here.
