# Agent and Skill Re-Audit

Every `/memory-sync` run audits every agent and skill at every scope/depth. The emitted agents and skills
batches cite this standing best-practice audit; fact-checking alone is insufficient.

**Project-specific checks live in the emitted SKILL.md's own check tables.** This file carries only what holds in
any repo; do not restate the project tables here, and do not weaken them with a generic equivalent.

Agent bodies are ALSO checked against `references/prompting-guide.md`'s rule table (role-first framing, duplicate
reminders, scattered CAPS, vague adjectives, ...) - see AGENT check 13 below; the rule table itself is not
restated here.

## Procedure - per file, before any edit

| # | Step |
|---|------|
| 1 | Read the WHOLE file. A frontmatter-only pass cannot judge tool minimality, scope fit or rule restatement |
| 2 | List what the body actually DOES: which tools it invokes, which paths it claims, which agents it names |
| 3 | Run the checks below against that list - evidence from the repo, never from the file's own claims |
| 4 | Split findings into MECHANICAL (fix now) and RESPONSIBILITY (report only) - see the last section |
| 5 | Apply mechanical fixes as targeted `Edit` diffs, bottom-up by line number, within the non-growth budget |

Evidence is gathered read-only, and from the FILESYSTEM: `git ls-files` is blind to git-ignored trees (in a repo
whose `.gitignore` carries `.claude/` it returns 0 rows and every agent reads as dead), and a git pathspec `*`
crosses `/` while a Claude Code glob does not - so a git probe cannot judge glob correctness either.

```bash
ls .claude/agents/*.md .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md .claude/skills/*/references/*.md 2>/dev/null || true  # roster
grep -n '^tools:\|^allowed-tools:\|^name:\|^model:' "<file>"  # declared contract
grep -oE 'mcp__[a-z0-9_]+__' "<file>" | sort -u               # MCP servers claimed
ls -d "<owned glob>" 2>/dev/null | head -3                    # ownership glob resolves (filesystem, not git)
```

A **runtime seat** is an agent a PROGRAM spawns rather than a human invoking it: a workflow file, an
orchestrator script, or a skill naming a `subagent_type`. Its instructions arrive from FOUR sources, and checks
14-15 hold only once all four have been read: the agent body; the prompt text each call site passes; the
constant blocks the caller splices into that prompt; every OTHER call site of the same seat. Find them first:

```bash
grep -rn "<seat-name>" --include='*.js' --include='*.mjs' --include='*.py' --include='*.md' . | grep -vF "<agent file>"
grep -rnE 'subagent_type|agent\(' --include='*.js' --include='*.mjs' . | grep "<seat-name>"
```

Which seats THIS project has is not listed here - the emitted SKILL.md's runtime-seat roster table names them.

## AGENT files (`.claude/agents/*.md`)

| # | Check | PASS criterion | FAIL action |
|---|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | `name:` vs filename | `name:` equals the filename without `.md` | Fix the frontmatter, never the filename - other files reference the path |
| 2 | `description:` shape | ROLE FIRST in the opening clause, then a concrete trigger list a router can match on | Rewrite role-first; add the real triggers used at the agent's call-sites (skills, CLAUDE.md, other agents) |
| 3 | Trigger concreteness | Triggers are phrases a user would actually type, not a restatement of the role | Replace vague triggers with the phrases the skill/agent is really called by |
| 4 | `tools:` minimality | Exactly the tools the BODY uses - nothing aspirational | Remove a tool used NOWHERE in the body; a read-only recon agent carrying `Write` / `Edit` is a defect, not a convenience. Use IMPLIED by the prose but never named (`Agent`, `Skill`, `WebFetch`) -> REPORT, never strip |
| 5 | Search capability | Search tools the body names are declared and available; native `Grep`/`Glob` availability is runtime-specific, not OS-wide | Keep available native tools; add `Bash` only when the body needs a shell fallback (`rg`/`find`, or installed `ugrep`/`bfs`) |
| 6 | `model:` | Present only when a non-default model is justified by the work (deep reasoning vs mechanical edits) | Drop an unjustified override; state the justification in one clause where it stays |
| 7 | Ownership globs | Every path or glob the body claims to own resolves to something real today | Repoint at the moved path; the owned surface is gone -> the agent may be dead, REPORT it |
| 8 | MCP tool prefixes | Every `mcp__<server>__*` names a CONFIGURED server in this project's MCP inventory | Remove or repoint the prefix. Tool names WITHIN a live server are not checkable offline - never claim they are |
| 9 | Handoff pointers | Every "hand off to X" / "not mine, see X" names an agent that EXISTS | Repoint at the real owner, or delete the pointer |
| 10 | Scope fit | The body states what the agent does NOT own, and the boundary matches the neighbouring agents' claims | Add the exclusion; overlapping claims between two agents -> REPORT, do not arbitrate silently |
| 11 | Output discipline | The body specifies the shape the agent returns to its caller | Add the return shape; an agent whose output shape is unstated produces unusable results |
| 12 | No rule restatement | The body does not repeat what a rule or convention file already says | DEDUP finding: delete the copy, leave a pointer naming the canonical file and section |
| 13 | Prompting quality | Body carries no open row from `references/prompting-guide.md`'s rule table, or the survivor is REPORTED as uncertain | Apply the rewrite the guide's row specifies; never restate the rule table here - cite the row number |
| 14 | Runtime seat sources | For an agent a PROGRAM spawns (a workflow file, an orchestrator script, a skill naming a `subagent_type`) every instruction source was read before the edit: the agent body, the prompt text each call site passes, the constant blocks the caller splices in, and every OTHER call site of the same seat | Read the missing sources and redo the judgement. The edit stands only once all four agree |
| 15 | Runtime seat contradiction | No instruction in the agent body contradicts what a call site passes it, and no contract line the caller depends on was compressed away - a return-schema field, a tool name, a command, an id, a threshold, a status string | Quote BOTH texts and REPORT. Reconcile silently only when one side names something that no longer exists, and then say which side you fixed |

## SKILL files (`.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` and their `references/*.md`)

| # | Check | PASS criterion | FAIL action |
|---|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | `name:` vs directory | `name:` equals the skill's DIRECTORY name | Fix the frontmatter - the directory name is what the invocation resolves |
| 2 | `description:` shape | ONE line, action-first ("Generates...", "Syncs..."), trigger-rich | Rewrite; a multi-line or noun-first description loses the router |
| 3 | `allowed-tools:` | Only tools the body actually uses: no agent-spawn tool if it never spawns, no `Write` / `Edit` if it never writes, no `Bash` if it runs nothing | Trim to actual use |
| 4 | `argument-hint:` | Lists exactly the modes / scopes the body IMPLEMENTS | Sync the hint to the body; a hinted mode with no implementation is a broken promise |
| 5 | Paths in body | Every path and file the body names EXISTS | Repoint or delete; a dead path makes a phase silently unrunnable |
| 6 | Commands in body | Every command runs in this repo today (the binary exists, the script exists, the manifest exists) | Replace with the real command; unverifiable here (a CI-only binary, another machine's path) -> REPORT it, never delete the step |
| 7 | Agent names in body | Every spawned `subagent_type` resolves to a real project agent or a built-in (`Explore` / `Plan` / `general-purpose`) | Replace with a real name - an invented one fails at first run |
| 8 | References, both directions | Every cited `references/*.md` EXISTS, and every existing sibling reference is still CITED | Missing file -> fix the citation. Uncited orphan -> cite it or REPORT it as dead weight |
| 9 | Reference content | Each reference is read by a phase that names it, with a stated reason | An orphaned or never-read reference is context that costs tokens at generation and buys nothing |
| 10 | Placeholder hygiene | A generated skill carries no unresolved generation-time placeholder. EXEMPT: tokens the skill itself documents as resolved at RUN time (its own scope / depth / count / list slots) | REPORT it - a leftover generation-time slot means the generator run did not finish |

---

## Frontmatter drift - verify, never memorize

The agent and skill frontmatter contract CHANGES between Claude Code versions: keys are added, renamed and
retired. Do not audit against a remembered key set.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Source of truth | The project's OWN current spec / authoring docs, or the keys the working files in this repo actually carry |
| Unknown key | REPORT it, never strip it - it may be newer than your knowledge. Equally, never ADD a key you cannot point at in the spec or in a sibling file |
| Missing key | Add only if the project's other files of the same kind carry it. A key present in 1 of 20 files is a candidate for DELETION, not for propagation |
| Consistency | Where a key is a house invariant (a date stamp, a doc-type marker), it must be present and current in every file of that kind |

---

## Fix vs report

| Class | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| MECHANICAL - apply the fix | `name:` mismatch (agent-1, skill-1), role-first description with concrete triggers (agent-2, agent-3), unjustified `model:` override (agent-6), dead path or glob (agent-7, skill-5), a tool entry used NOWHERE in the body (agent-4), undeclared search tool required by the body (agent-5), dead MCP server prefix (agent-8), broken reference citation and uncited orphan reference (skill-8, skill-9), restated rule replaced by a pointer (agent-12), a prompting-guide rewrite where its lossless guard allows it (agent-13), date stamp, wording compressed |
| RESPONSIBILITY - report only | Anything that changes WHAT an agent owns or does: widening or narrowing its scope, retargeting its ownership globs to a different subsystem, merging or splitting agents, deleting an agent whose surface is gone, resolving two agents that claim the same seam, ADDING a missing output shape (agent-11 - authoring, and it spends the non-growth budget), stripping a tool whose use is implied in prose but never named, a contradiction between a runtime seat's body and one of its call sites (agent-15 - quote BOTH texts) |

A responsibility change is a design decision. State the finding, the evidence, and the proposed change in the
report, and let the user decide. Silently rewriting an agent's role removes a capability nobody knows is gone.

Check 14 belongs to neither class: it is a PRECONDITION on any edit to a runtime-seat file, not a finding.
The edit does not start until all four instruction sources have been read; an unread source is a reason to
stop, not a row in the report.

Every audit finding, fixed or reported, names the FILE and the CHECK number above, so a Phase 3 checker can
re-run exactly that check without re-deriving the judgement.

## Reporting shape

Returned alongside the batch's normal per-file JSON:

```
"<path>": {
  "audit_fixed":    [ {"check": "agent-5", "was": "<text>", "now": "<text>"} ],
  "audit_reported": [ {"check": "agent-10", "finding": "<text>", "evidence": "<command or path>"} ]
}
```

An empty `audit_fixed` and `audit_reported` on every file means the roster is clean - state that explicitly in
the report. A silent audit section reads as an audit that never ran.
