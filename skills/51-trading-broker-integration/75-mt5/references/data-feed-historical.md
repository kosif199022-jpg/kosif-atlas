# Data Feed: Functions, Depth, and Data Quality

The `copy_rates_*` and `copy_ticks_*` family pulls bars and ticks from the MT5 terminal's local cache (downloaded from the broker on demand). All return numpy structured arrays. No rate limits in the local IPC - the bottleneck is the broker download for data not yet cached.

## When to use

Pulling historical OHLCV or ticks for backtesting, indicator computation, or as the bootstrap step of a live data feed. For market depth (Level 2) and live tick subscription (which is also polling), see the bottom of this file.

## Function choice (the only thing to memorize)

| Function | Selects by | Use case |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `copy_rates_from_pos(symbol, tf, start_pos, count)` | Relative index (0 = current) | Live trading: "last 200 bars" |
| `copy_rates_from(symbol, tf, date_from, count)` | N bars going back from a date | Fixed-size historical windows |
| `copy_rates_range(symbol, tf, date_from, date_to)` | All bars in a calendar interval | Bulk historical download (variable N) |

Tick equivalents: `copy_ticks_from()` and `copy_ticks_range()`. Tick flags: `COPY_TICKS_ALL`, `COPY_TICKS_INFO` (bid/ask only), `COPY_TICKS_TRADE` (last/volume only).

Returned numpy fields: bars = `time, open, high, low, close, tick_volume, spread, real_volume`; ticks = `time, bid, ask, last, volume, time_msc, flags, volume_real`.

## Gotchas

- **MT5 is UTC internally. Naive datetimes silently break things.** The single most common cause of missing/wrong data:
  ```python
  import pytz
  utc = pytz.timezone("Etc/UTC")
  dt = datetime(2024, 1, 1, tzinfo=utc)   # always tz-aware UTC
  ```
- **`real_volume` is always 0 for OTC forex.** Only exchange-traded instruments populate it. Use `tick_volume` for forex (counts ticks, not contracts) and never benchmark forex liquidity by `real_volume`.
- **`tick_volume` varies between brokers** for the same instrument. ECN brokers report more ticks; market makers may filter/aggregate. Don't assume cross-broker comparability.
- **`spread` field = spread at bar close**, not the average. Useful as a sanity gauge, useless as a trading signal on its own.
- **Tick depth is broker-dependent**: from a few days to 1-2 years. EURUSD generates ~200k+ ticks/day - requesting months produces tens of millions of rows. Cache aggressively.
- **"Max bars in chart" defaults to 100,000.** Set to **Unlimited** in MT5 → Tools → Options → Charts, otherwise large historical pulls return truncated arrays with no error.
- **MT5 builds intraday timeframes from M1.** No M1 cache = no derived intraday data. Weekends/holidays have no bars (no placeholder rows inserted).
- **Tick data quality matters more than bar data.** ECN brokers ≫ market makers for tick fidelity. If you're tick-driven, broker selection is part of your strategy.
- **`market_book_*` (Level 2) is also polling** - there are no push notifications for depth updates either.

## Bootstrap + incremental cache (the production pattern)

Parquet with Zstandard compression is the community choice - ~5-10x compression, type preservation, fast reads via pandas/pyarrow. Tick data: partition by day or month.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Initial bootstrap
rates = mt5.copy_rates_range("EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_M1, start, end)
df = pd.DataFrame(rates)
df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'], unit='s', utc=True)
df.to_parquet("eurusd_m1.parquet", compression="zstd")

# Incremental update (every run after bootstrap)
existing = pd.read_parquet("eurusd_m1.parquet")
last_time = existing['time'].max()
new_rates = mt5.copy_rates_from("EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_M1, last_time, 10000)
if new_rates is not None and len(new_rates) > 0:
    new_df = pd.DataFrame(new_rates)
    new_df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(new_df['time'], unit='s', utc=True)
    combined = (pd.concat([existing, new_df])
                  .drop_duplicates(subset='time')
                  .sort_values('time'))
    combined.to_parquet("eurusd_m1.parquet", compression="zstd")
```

## Market depth (Level 2)

```python
mt5.market_book_add("EURUSD")
book = mt5.market_book_get("EURUSD")
if book:
    for entry in book:
        side = 'BUY' if entry.type == 1 else 'SELL'
        print(f"{side} {entry.volume} @ {entry.price}")
mt5.market_book_release("EURUSD")
```

Polling-based; you call `market_book_get()` repeatedly to detect changes.

## Typical depth available (broker-dependent)

| Timeframe | Typical depth |
|-----------|---------------|
| D1 | 20-30+ years |
| H1 | 10-15+ years |
| M1 | Weeks to ~2 years |
| Ticks | Days to 1-2 years |

## MT5 vs IBKR for data (one-line summary)

MT5 has no rate limits and includes data with the account, but quality is broker-dependent. IBKR has strict pacing and per-exchange paid subscriptions for most instruments (spot FX is an exception and needs no subscription), but data is exchange-sourced and consistent. Forex/CFD = MT5 wins on convenience; equity/futures with real volume = IBKR wins on quality. One IBKR-specific trap has no MT5 equivalent: its historical responses include the currently-forming bar as the last row, and its FX responses carry session-anchored stub bars, so code ported from MT5 must drop both.
