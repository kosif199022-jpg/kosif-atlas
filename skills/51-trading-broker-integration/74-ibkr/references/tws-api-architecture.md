# TWS API Architecture and ib_async

The TWS API is a local TCP socket protocol (Protocol Buffers encoding in recent 10.x versions) between Python and TWS or IB Gateway. Current production version: **10.49** (August 2026), the release that also **open-sourced the TWS API under the GPL**. Version 10.47 removed `reqFundamentalData` and its protobuf variants entirely. Use `ib_async` (the maintained successor to ib_insync) for all new code unless you have a specific reason to use the official ibapi.

This file is the only place in this skill that states the TWS API version number. Everywhere else stays version-free on purpose; update it here.

## When to use

Building a Python algotrading system that talks to Interactive Brokers. For account management or reporting in cloud contexts (without active trading), the IBKR Web API + OAuth is a separate path -- not this file.

## TWS vs IB Gateway (the only choice that matters)

**Use IB Gateway in production** -- lighter RAM/CPU footprint than TWS, smaller attack surface, API enabled by default. TWS is for development when you want the GUI alongside.

| Aspect | TWS | IB Gateway |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Default ports (live/paper) | 7496 / 7497 | 4001 / 4002 |
| API enabled by default | No (manual toggle) | **Yes** |
| Auto-update | Yes | Offline version only |

Both: max 32 simultaneous connections, manual login required (use IBC for automation, see `gateway-automation.md`), use the **offline/standalone build in production** -- the auto-updater silently breaks bots.

## Gotchas

- **Never `time.sleep()` in a TWS API callback.** It blocks the entire event loop and freezes message processing. Use `ib.sleep(seconds)` or `asyncio.sleep()`. CPU work in callbacks goes through `loop.run_in_executor()`.
- **The sync API twins are a trap inside async code.** Every `IB.x()` has an `IB.xAsync()` counterpart; the sync form calls `run_until_complete` internally and raises `RuntimeError: This event loop is already running` when invoked from a coroutine. The failure shape is an order-preparation path that crashes on a sync call such as `IB.accountSummary()` and never sends the order. Inside any async context, only the `*Async` forms are safe.
- **`clientId=0` is special** -- it merges with manual TWS trading and sees orders placed by hand. Bots should use dedicated non-zero IDs (1=data, 2=orders, 3=monitoring). Configure a Master Client ID in TWS to receive updates from all clients: the master receives `orderStatus`/`openOrder` for every API client, clientId 0 receives its own plus manual TWS orders, and a master set to 0 receives TWS, FIX and all API orders together. `reqAutoOpenOrders` (auto-binding of new manual orders) works **only** on clientId 0, and binding assigns the manual order an API id (negative by default, per the "Use negative numbers to bind automatic orders" setting).
- **One brokerage session per username, across all IBKR products.** A second login (TWS, Gateway, Client Portal, mobile) can take the session; the losing side is disconnected, and IBKR's own note for error 1100 lists "a competing session" among its causes. Automation needs a dedicated username (additional usernames per account are supported); two processes sharing one username steal the session from each other indefinitely.
- **Do not reuse a bot's username in Client Portal.** Documented consequences, easy to hit while "just checking the account" in a browser: that TWS/Gateway session loses the ability to auto-reconnect after the next disconnection, and a paper session sharing the live user's market data stops receiving data entirely.
- **Error 326 = "clientId already in use."** Restart-safe IDs require a dedicated assignment scheme. A half-open socket left behind by a cancelled connect attempt can also collide with the next attempt (see `reconnection-resilience.md`).
- **The IBKR Web API's limits are per endpoint, and that is what disqualifies it as a trading plane.** The documented global limit is **50 requests per second per authenticated username**, not the 10/sec this file previously claimed: 10 req/s is the specific limit on `/iserver/marketdata/snapshot`. The endpoints an order-state loop would live on are far tighter: `/iserver/trades`, `/iserver/orders` and several portfolio routes are documented at **1 request per 5 seconds**, scanners at 1/sec, and `/pa/*` performance routes at **1 request per 15 minutes**. Breaching returns `429 Too Many Requests`, with violator IPs put in a 10-minute penalty box and repeat violators "permanently blocked until the issue is resolved". A socket that pushes order and tick events is a different category of thing; use the TWS API for execution and state, and reserve the Web API for account lifecycle, funding and reporting work, which is the scope IBKR markets it for. IBKR is merging Client Portal Web API, Digital Account Management, and Flex into one "Web API" brand; older docs use both names for the same product.
- **`ib_insync` is archived** (March 2024, after the author's passing). Migration to `ib_async` is nearly drop-in: `from ib_async import *`.
- **Pin `ib_async` with an upper bound** (`ib_async<3.0.0`) and record why: the library forked from ib_insync in 2024, and a future major could change the `errorEvent` signature or `placeOrder` semantics. A pin forces an explicit upgrade decision instead of passive drift.
- **ib_async's event layer is `aeventkit`**, the ib-api-reloaded fork of eventkit (the original package's PyPI publishing is blocked). The import name and logger names remain `eventkit.*`, so existing logging routing keeps working; only the installed distribution name changed.
- **ib_async normalizes sizes to `float`** (verified on 2.1.0: every `Ticker` size field is typed `float`), while ibapi 10.44+ migrates size fields to `Decimal` on the wire. Sub-share precision can be lost in the client layer; never echo a ticker-derived price or size back into an order without snapping to the market rule and size increment first.
- **Silent-empty is the default failure shape** (verified on 2.1.0): `IB.RaiseRequestErrors` defaults to `False`, so a failed request returns an empty result instead of raising, and `IB.RequestTimeout` defaults to `0`, waiting indefinitely, while `reqHistoricalData` alone carries its own 60 s timeout that returns an empty series. Decide per system, explicitly, which of the three behaviours you want.
- **PyPI `ibapi` is frozen, not merely lagging.** The package is IBKR-authored (author "IBG LLC") but its last upload is 9.81.1.post1 from December 2020 (verified against PyPI metadata 2026-08-13). The current client ships only inside the TWS API download; `ibapi-latest` / `ibapi-stable` on PyPI are unofficial community re-packagers of that source, updated automatically and not IBKR-endorsed. Either build the wheel from the official zip or pin an exact mirror version knowingly.
- **Threading vs asyncio**: ib_async (asyncio) is more robust for production. When integrating with sync frameworks (Flask, Django), put IB work in a dedicated thread with its own asyncio loop and communicate via queues -- mixing event loops cross-thread will eventually deadlock.

## Connection skeleton

```python
from ib_async import *

async def main():
    ib = IB()
    await ib.connectAsync('127.0.0.1', 4001, clientId=1)
    contract = Stock('AAPL', 'SMART', 'USD')
    await ib.qualifyContractsAsync(contract)
    # ...
    ib.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Three event-loop styles: `ib.run()` (sync, simplest standalone bots), `asyncio.run()` with `*Async` methods (max control), `util.startLoop()` (Jupyter via nest_asyncio).
