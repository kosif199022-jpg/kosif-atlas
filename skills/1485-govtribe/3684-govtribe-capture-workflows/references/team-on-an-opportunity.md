# Team On An Opportunity

Use this reference when the user wants to discover, create, or coordinate a teaming interest on a specific federal opportunity.

## Goal
- Discover which other GovTribe users have already created a teaming interest on the opportunity, create the user's own teaming interest when they want to participate, and coordinate matches between the user and partners.
- For teaming as a sub-input of a broader pursuit assessment, hand off to [Bid/No-Bid Review](./conduct-bid-no-bid-review.md) and use `Search_Teaming_Interests` as the teaming-needs enrichment step.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the opportunity first
- Resolve the opportunity from the user's prompt. If you cannot, route through [Relevant Opportunities](./relevant-opportunities.md); if it still cannot be identified, ask one focused question and stop.

### 2. Discover who has already created a teaming interest
- Lead with `Search_Teaming_Interests` filtered by the opportunity.
- Discovered teaming interests are anonymized cross-user. The agent sees the AI-generated name, summary, intent, descriptions, accolades, dates, and the posting user's identity — but NOT the counterparty's vendor, intake answers, or current status. Do not infer or claim vendor identity for a discovered interest; vendor reveals only at the moment a match is accepted.
- For named-vendor asks ("I want to team with [Company X]" or "[Company X] wants to partner with us"), the agent cannot match a vendor name to a discovered interest. If the user has the partner's `govtribe_url` or `teaming_interest_id`, target that directly; otherwise the partner must create their own teaming interest first so the user can engage through discovery — external invitation is the user's step.
- For named-vendor capability or competitor analysis (which works from historical award data where vendor identity is preserved), hand off to [Likely Bidders](./likely-bidders.md) or [Past Performance Match](./past-performance-match.md).

### 3. Create the user's own teaming interest only when they want to participate
- Confirm which vendor the user is representing. Find the vendor with `Search_Vendors`. If the vendor is not on GovTribe, tell the user to claim or create the vendor profile first and stop until they do.
- Ask the user the intent-specific intake questions before calling:
  - Prime: `capture_stage` AND `sub_workshare_expectations`.
  - Sub: `role_and_workshare` AND `relevant_experience`. Optional: `socioeconomic_value`, `clearance_and_location`, `partner_preferences`, `staffing_capacity`.
- Call `Create_Teaming_Interest`.

### 4. Engage with a partner who has already created a teaming interest
- If the user has not yet created their own teaming interest, call `Create_Interest_And_Request_Match`.
- If the user has already created a teaming interest on this opportunity, call `Request_Teaming_Match`.

### 5. Respond to an inbound match when the user is the recipient
- Find inbound requests with `Search_Teaming_Matches` filtered by `my_pending_inbound=true`.
- Read the conversation with `Get_Teaming_Messages`. The user can send clarifying questions via `Send_Teaming_Message` before deciding.
- Accept or decline with `Respond_To_Teaming_Match`. Decline is permanent — the same requester cannot re-request, so confirm the user's intent before calling.

### 6. Draft messages in the match conversation
- Opening (after requesting a match) → 3–5 sentences: vendor + proposed role, 1–2 specifics, the gap, a next step. The recipient already sees the sender's abbreviated personal name (FirstName L.) via `author_name`; lead with vendor name and value prop, not a first-name introduction.
- Clarifying (on an inbound match, before deciding) → 2–4 specific questions: proposed role, workshare expectation, vehicle access, past performance on the relevant scope.
- Decline → 1–2 sentences: acknowledge, general reason, thank.
- Post-acceptance → single-topic, 2–6 sentences each: workshare split, role boundaries, proposal timeline, RFP coordination.
- Hub (post-lock-in) → team-level single-topic: kickoffs, role/scope confirmations, status updates, deliverable check-ins, decisions needing team buy-in.

### 7. Manage the user's interest or team after creation
- Hide the user's own interest from discovery without cancelling existing matches → `Hide_Teaming_Interest`. Put it back into discovery → `Reopen_Teaming_Interest`.
- Withdraw the user's own interest entirely (cancels pending matches against it) → `Withdraw_Teaming_Interest`. If the user is ambiguous between hide and withdraw, surface the distinction (hide preserves pending matches; withdraw cancels them) and let the user choose.
- Cancel a single match the user initiated → `Withdraw_Teaming_Match`.
- Prime-only: `Lock_In_Teaming_Team` forms the team and auto-withdraws the prime's other still-pending inbound match requests — confirm the chosen accepted subs and the to-be-withdrawn count with the user before calling. `Disband_Teaming_Team` ends the locked team for everyone — confirm before calling.

## Output contract
- After each tool call, clearly and simply tell the user what just happened — what the tool changed (or returned), and what they can do next.
- In the web UI the other party appears anonymously ("Looking for subcontractors" / "Looking for prime contractors" + blurred avatar) until first acceptance — both sides see real vendor identity at the moment either accepts.
