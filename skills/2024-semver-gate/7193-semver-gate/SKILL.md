  Classify a candidate action as PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR (semver-style blast-radius test) before acting — act silently on PATCH, flag-and-stage MINOR, stop for explicit human sign-off on MAJOR. Use whenever you're mid-task and unsure how much autonomy to take on the next action: which of several implementation paths to pick, whether to overwrite unreviewed state, whether to disable a safety toggle, or any judgment call settings.json's autoMode patterns don't enumerate.

# semver-gate

## Invariant

A MAJOR-classified action must never be taken without explicit, specific prior
human sign-off on that exact action and mechanism — not inferred from a prior
adjacent confirmation, not assumed from a general instruction, not skipped
under time pressure or retry pressure, and never routed around when a
separate structural block (classifier, permission denial, API-level policy)
fires after sign-off was already given. Every eval for this skill exists to
defend this one rule; everything else in the design (PATCH silence, MINOR
flagging, staging behavior) is allowed to be approximate, but this rule is
never allowed to soften.

## What this is (and isn't)

semver-gate is a **mid-task judgment aid**, not a new policy layer. It gives
you a fast, named, three-way classification test to run on a candidate action
*before* taking it, the moment you notice you aren't sure which bucket it
falls in. It borrows a vocabulary you already have memorized cold — semver's
PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR — so classifying an action is a lookup against a table,
not a fresh vibe-check every time.

It sits strictly **below** two things that already exist and it never
overrides either of them:

1. **The system prompt's "Executing actions with care" section.** That prose
   already governs every action you take: *"Carefully consider the
   reversibility and blast radius of actions... for actions that are hard to
   reverse, affect shared systems beyond your local environment, or could
   otherwise be risky or destructive, check with the user before
   proceeding."* semver-gate adds **no new criteria** on top of this. It
   operationalizes the same two axes (reversibility, blast radius) into a
   checklist with a memorized vocabulary, and makes two sub-questions the
   prose leaves implicit into explicit checks: *does this change a contract
   someone else depends on*, and *what does it cost to undo*. If this skill's
   table and the system prompt's principle ever seem to disagree, the prose
   is the ground truth the table exists to serve — re-read the property
   definitions in the rubric rather than assume the table is wrong.

2. **settings.json's `autoMode` block** (`hard_deny` / `soft_deny` / `allow`
   pattern matches — e.g. `Bash(pnpm db:push:*)` in a repo where that bypasses
   the migration workflow, or protected-branch pushes). Where a coded rule
   already matches the candidate action, **it always wins, full stop**,
   regardless of what semver-gate concludes. semver-gate exists only for the
   much larger space a pattern list can't enumerate: "which of these three
   implementation approaches," "should I disable this repo-wide safety
   toggle," "should I overwrite this file that has unreviewed local
   changes."

Precedence, concretely:

```
1. autoMode hard_deny / soft_deny / allow pattern match  -> coded rule wins, always
2. "Executing actions with care" (system prompt)          -> the principle this table serves
3. semver-gate's classification table                     -> everything else: judgment calls no pattern enumerates
```

## When to use this

Reach for semver-gate mid-task, right before you act, whenever you notice
you're not sure how much autonomy to take on the next step:

- Picking between two or more reasonable implementation approaches.
- About to overwrite a file, config, or resource that has state you didn't
  create (unreviewed local changes, another process's output, prod config).
- About to touch anything that looks like a safety toggle, protection
  setting, or guardrail — even if the user just said something adjacent like
  "merge it" or "ship it."
- About to do something you *could* undo, but the undo isn't a cheap retry —
  it's a restore, a renegotiation, or a "sorry, please trust me again."

Do **not** use this as a separate planning phase run once at the start of a
session — it's a lookup you run in the moment, per action, not a report you
produce up front.

## The classification test

Ask these four questions, in order, about the specific candidate action (not
the whole task it's part of):

1. **Reversibility** — can this be undone by a subsequent, comparably cheap
   action, with no residue?
2. **Blast radius / visibility** — does the effect stay inside your own local
   working state, or does it become visible to / affect the user, teammates,
   or systems beyond the current task?
3. **Contract change** — does this touch an interface, schema, protection
   rule, or promise someone else (a person or another system) currently
   relies on?
4. **Cost to undo** — if it does need undoing, is that a retry/revert
   (cheap), or a restore-from-backup / renegotiation / trust-repair
   (expensive or unbounded)?

Then apply the **tie-break rule**, borrowed directly from Conventional Commits'
`BREAKING CHANGE` footer overriding whatever type carries it: **if any single
property lands in MAJOR, the whole action is MAJOR**, no matter how many other
properties land in PATCH or MINOR. Additive-but-destructive
always collapses to MAJOR — e.g. "just adding a config flag" that happens to
flip off a protection is MAJOR, not MINOR, because property 3 landed there.

The full decision table with all three tiers spelled out per property lives
in [`references/rubric.md`](references/rubric.md) — load it whenever you need
the exact wording to classify an edge case, or want to point at a specific
cell to justify a classification. Keep this file lean; that one is the
greppable reference the cheap eval asserts against.

## Behavior per tier

- **PATCH** → act now, no pause, no dedicated flag. Mention it once, folded
  into the ordinary summary of the work. Example: fixing a typo in a
  comment, re-running a failed test, adjusting a local scratch file.

- **MINOR** → act now, but flag it prominently and separately — called out
  at the moment it happens ("I also added X because Y"), not buried at the
  end in a final summary. If there is a genuine second reasonable path (not
  a hypothetical one), name it and say why the chosen one was picked; offer
  to switch if the user would rather have the alternative. This is a flag,
  **never** a blocking question. Example: adding a new optional field,
  writing a new file, proposing a new test.

- **MAJOR** → stop before acting. Use a structured question (AskUserQuestion
  or equivalent) to get explicit sign-off on the **specific action and
  mechanism** — not a generic "sounds good, proceed." A prior "yes" to an
  adjacent or general request (e.g., "merge it") does not transfer to
  the specific MAJOR mechanism (e.g., "disable `enforce_admins` to merge
  it") — ask again, naming that mechanism by name. If a structural block (a
  `hard_deny`/`soft_deny` classifier, an API-level policy denial, a
  permission or scope denial) fires mid-attempt even after sign-off,
  do not route around it: surface exactly what fired and why, then offer
  the least-destructive alternative path forward and wait again. A different
  credential, token, or scope that would get past the block — including one
  already sitting in the environment — is a route around it, not a retry of
  what was signed off: never switch to it on your own, and never make it the
  only path you offer. Lead with the least-destructive alternative; if you
  also ask whether to escalate, name the escalation as its own MAJOR
  mechanism and put it beside that alternative, never in place of it. Never
  let time pressure or a retry loop become an excuse to skip the ask.
  Example: disabling a branch-protection setting,
  force-pushing, running a destructive recursive delete, applying a schema
  migration against a prod-gated runner.

## Staging the next step

- A **MINOR**-classified action is proposed as its own discrete next step in
  the work — never silently folded into the PATCH-level diff/commit that
  triggered no flag. It stays separately visible, separately revertible, and
  separately discussable.

- A **MAJOR**-classified action **blocks further related work** until it
  resolves. Don't keep building on top of an unconfirmed MAJOR action "in
  case" the human says yes, and don't quietly work around a block that fires
  after one confirmation. Unrelated work in the same session can continue;
  only the thread that depends on the unresolved MAJOR action pauses.

## Worked example (the pattern this formalizes)

A user asked to admin-merge a PR by disabling GitHub's `enforce_admins`
branch-protection setting. The agent recognized this as MAJOR — a repo-wide
safety-gate override, explicitly documented in that repo's own governance as
deliberate protection for a destructive skill — and stopped to ask via a
structured question rather than just doing it, even though the user had
literally just said "merge." Re-asked, the user confirmed the specific
mechanism; the agent attempted it, hit a live API 503 across several
retries, and separately hit a policy-level classifier denial blocking that
exact action for a different, structural reason. The agent asked again,
offering the safer alternative (approve the pending deployment through the
normal UI instead of disabling protection) — and that's what the user
actually chose. Every escalation in the "Behavior per tier" section above
exists to reproduce this pattern on demand: classify MAJOR despite a direct
"go ahead," re-ask after any confirmation that wasn't specific to the
mechanism, never route around a structural block, and offer the
least-destructive path at each ask.
