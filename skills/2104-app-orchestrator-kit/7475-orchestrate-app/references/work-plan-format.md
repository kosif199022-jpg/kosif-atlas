# Work-plan format — `work-plan.md`

**Written by**: `scripts/analyze-capabilities.mjs` (Station 2a) and the `orchestrate-app` skill
(track/task status updates).
**Read by**: `orchestrate-app` on every invocation (Station 0).
**Location**: `.spec/app/work-plan.md` when the spec lives under `.spec/spec/`. Legacy specs keep it beside `spec.md`.

Hybrid YAML front matter + append-only Markdown `## Log`.

`work-plan-version` is `"1.1"` when the plan was derived from a spec 2.0 delivery plan (tasks
carry `slice-ref` and `depends-on`, one `B-*` per slice) and `"1.0"` for a 1.x spec (one `B-*`
per entity). See `track-decomposition.md`.

Frontend `T-*` tasks live in `task-checklist.md` (frontend-orchestrator-kit). This file only
lists `B-*` and `A-*` increment tasks plus track-level frontend status.

## Status lifecycle

Same as the frontend checklist: `pending` → `in-progress` → `done` / `pending` (abort) /
`blocked` (error, including `blocked-reason: stale-agent`) / leave `in-progress` (missing
envelope; a stale pulse rebuilds once, then blocks). Only a human writes `skipped`.
