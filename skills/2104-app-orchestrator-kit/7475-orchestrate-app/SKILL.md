name: orchestrate-app
description: Runs the full-stack app-dev-kit dispatcher — spec-dev-kit to author a spec, html-generator-kit to prototype it, then analyzes those outputs and calls backend-dev-kit, agent-dev-kit, and frontend-orchestrator-kit only when needed — tracked against a persisted, resumable work-plan. Use when starting or resuming a whole app/domain build that may include API, AI agents, and React screens. For a frontend-only screen-task loop use /orchestrate-frontend. For a single feature use /feature-dev. Cross-kit handoff is file paths and kit-result.json envelopes, never inlined spec or prototype bodies.

# Orchestrate App

**Entry point for**: the app-dev-kit family as a whole (spec → prototype → backend / agent / frontend)
**Delegates to**: `spec-dev-kit:generate-spec`, `html-generator-kit:generate-html`,
`backend-dev-kit:backend-dev`, `agent-dev-kit:agent-dev`,
`frontend-orchestrator-kit:orchestrate-frontend`
**State file**: `.spec/app/work-plan.md` (pointer: `.spec/app/current.json`)
**Handoff**: `references/result-envelope.md` + `references/context-budget.md`

This skill runs in the **main conversation**. It owns every `AskUserQuestion` call **of its own**.
Delegated kits own theirs. After a callee returns, Read its `kit-result.json`.

`disable-model-invocation: true` — only a human types `/orchestrate-app`. Callees stay invokable.

## Resolve KIT_DIR (do this first)

`KIT_DIR` is the **plugin root** (the directory that contains `skills/`). Resolve in this order;
use the first that exists:

1. Parent of this skill folder — `{this SKILL.md directory}/../..` (Claude: if
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is set, `KIT_DIR` is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`).
2. `app-dev-kit/app-orchestrator-kit` relative to the workspace root.
3. `.spec/app-orchestrator-kit`.

All script and reference paths are `{KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-app/…`.

Resolve `PULSE_SCRIPT` in this order; use the first that exists:

1. `{KIT_DIR}/../frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs`
2. `app-dev-kit/frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs` under the workspace root.

Pass that path as `PULSE_SCRIPT` on every delegated skill. `WATCH` is `.spec/app/watch/current.json`. After a callee returns, run the post-return check in `agent-liveness.md` (sibling `frontend-orchestrator-kit`) before trusting the envelope. `reason: stale-agent` sets the task or track `blocked` with `blocked-reason: stale-agent`, asks once, and does not start the next task. A missing envelope whose pulse exits 3, 4, or 5 rebuilds that call once, then blocks the same way.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check | If missing |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Delegated plugins installed | Skill names resolve | STOP — install the plugin |
| `.spec/context/*.md` (new run, no approved spec) | `Glob(".spec/context/*.md")` | STOP |
| Clean git tree before each increment spawn | `git status --porcelain` | Ask: commit, stash, or abort |

Do not pre-install callee dependencies. Track order is backend → agent → frontend.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `[app-name or existing spec/work-plan slug]` | Optional | Matches `slug` in `.spec/app/current.json` to resume. |

```
/orchestrate-app
/orchestrate-app demo-app
/orchestrate-app "a review tool for profiles"
```

## Steps

Read `references/pipeline-flow.md` and `references/context-budget.md` before starting.

### Station 0 — Resume

Read `.spec/app/current.json` and `.spec/app/work-plan.md`. If the argument matches `slug`:

- Read YAML only (track/task id/status/paths).
- `SPEC_PATH` = `spec-ref`. If missing or spec `status` is not `approved`, STOP.
- If `spec.md` is newer than `updated`, or analysis would change tracks: `AskUserQuestion` —
  **Re-derive work-plan** · **Resume as-is** · **Abort**.
- Else jump to the first track whose `status` is not `done` or `skipped` (and, for backend/agent,
  the first unfinished `B-*` / `A-*` task).
- Report: `"Resuming {slug} — tracks {done}/{needed}."`

Otherwise continue to Station 1.

### Station 1 — Spec

Read `.spec/app/current.json`. If `spec_path` exists and that spec's `status` is `approved`, set
`SPEC_PATH` and skip to Station 2. Do not glob for a newer spec folder.

If none:

1. Empty `.spec/context/` → STOP without invoking generate-spec.
2. Invoke `spec-dev-kit:generate-spec` with the slug/app name only, plus:

   ```
   WATCH:        .spec/app/watch/current.json
   PULSE_SCRIPT: {PULSE_SCRIPT}
   ```

3. After it returns, run the post-return check in `agent-liveness.md` on the pulse in `.spec/app/watch/current.json`. Then read `.spec/app/current.json`. `spec_path` set and the envelope `approved` → `SPEC_PATH` = that path. Envelope `error` with `reason: stale-agent`, or a missing envelope whose pulse is still exit 3, 4, or 5 after one rebuild → STOP. Ask once. Else if the pointer is missing or the envelope is `aborted` / `error` → STOP.

Do not Read `spec.md` body.

### Station 2 — Prototype (optional)

`AskUserQuestion` — generate a clickable HTML prototype? **Yes** / **Skip**.

On **Yes**: invoke `html-generator-kit:generate-html` with:

```
SPEC_PATH:    {SPEC_PATH}
PULSE:        {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/watch/html-orchestrator.json
PULSE_SCRIPT: {PULSE_SCRIPT}
WATCH:        .spec/app/watch/current.json
```

After return, run the post-return check in `agent-liveness.md`, then Read `{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/html-kit-result.json`. `approved` → `PROTOTYPE_REF` = `prototype_ref`. `error` with `reason: stale-agent`, or a missing envelope whose pulse is still exit 3, 4, or 5 after one rebuild → ask once: **Continue without prototype** or **Stop**. Do not treat a stale run as a finished prototype. Other `aborted` / `error` / missing → `PROTOTYPE_REF = ""`.

On **Skip**: `PROTOTYPE_REF = ""`. Never Read prototype HTML.

### Station 2a — Analyze (this skill owns this gate)

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-app/scripts/analyze-capabilities.mjs {SPEC_PATH} --prototype-ref "{PROTOTYPE_REF}"
```

If `{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/artifacts/changes.json` exists, add `--changes` with that path.

Exit 1 — no needed tracks — report and stop. Exit 2 — parse failure — stop.

Read `work-plan.md` YAML `tracks[]` (id, needed, confidence, task counts). Present one
`AskUserQuestion`: **Approve as-is** · **Skip a track** (human names it → `status: skipped`) ·
**Abort**. A `confidence: low` agent track **must** be confirmed, not silently kept.

### Station 3 — Backend loop

Skip if track `backend` is not `needed` or is `skipped`/`done`.

For each `tasks[]` with `track: backend` that is not `done`/`skipped`, in work-plan order (a 1.1
work-plan follows the spec's delivery slices; a task's `depends-on` ids must be `done` first —
otherwise ask once whether to build the dependency first or skip):

1. Dirty tree → commit / stash / abort-task. Never spawn dirty.
2. Set task `in-progress`. Set track `in-progress`.
3. Invoke `backend-dev-kit:backend-dev`:

   ```
   REQUEST:        Backend-task {id} ({slug-hint}). Read UPSTREAM_SPEC.
   UPSTREAM_SPEC:  {SPEC_PATH}
   TASK_ID:        {id}
   SLICE_REF:      {slice-ref, or omit on a 1.0 work-plan}
   ENTITY_REFS:    {entity-refs}
   API_REFS:       {api-refs}
   STORY_REFS:     {story-refs}
   AC_REFS:        {ac-refs}
   PROTOTYPE_REF:  {PROTOTYPE_REF}
   SLUG_HINT:      {slug-hint}
   CHANGE:         remove
   RESULT_OUT:     .spec/app/results/{id}.json
   PULSE:          .spec/backend/{slug-hint}.context/pulse.json
   PULSE_SCRIPT:   {PULSE_SCRIPT}
   WATCH:          .spec/app/watch/current.json
   ```

   Pass `CHANGE=remove` only when the task `change` is `remove`. Station 4 does the same.

4. Run the post-return check in `agent-liveness.md` on `.spec/backend/{slug-hint}.context/pulse.json` (the callee rewrites `WATCH` when the real slug differs). Then Read `RESULT_OUT` (fallback `.spec/backend/{slug}.kit-result.json`). Apply the outcome table in `result-envelope.md`. `reason: stale-agent` blocks this task and does not start the next one.
5. If tasks remain: continue / pause / abort. Never auto-run the next increment.

When all `B-*` tasks are `done` or `skipped`, set track `done` and `result` to the last envelope
(or `.spec/app/results/` if mixed).

### Station 4 — Agent loop

Same as Station 3 for `track: agent` → `agent-dev-kit:agent-dev`.

Also pass `AGENT_REF: {agent-ref}` (and `SLICE_REF`, as in Station 3), plus:

```
PULSE:         .spec/agents/{slug-hint}.context/pulse.json
PULSE_SCRIPT:  {PULSE_SCRIPT}
WATCH:         .spec/app/watch/current.json
```

The callee writes that watch pointer with `--station 4`. After return, run the same post-return check as Station 3 on this pulse. `reason: stale-agent` blocks this task and does not start the next one.

If a task’s `embed` (from the spec, which the callee reads) is `backend-route` and
`src/http/create-app.ts` is missing, the callee STOPs. Do not invent a second HTTP stack;
offer to run the backend track first or skip embed.

### Station 5 — Frontend

Skip if track `frontend` is not `needed` or is `skipped`/`done`.

Dirty tree → commit / stash / abort-track.

Invoke `frontend-orchestrator-kit:orchestrate-frontend`:

```
SPEC_PATH:      {SPEC_PATH}
PROTOTYPE_REF:  {PROTOTYPE_REF}
SKIP_UPSTREAM:  true
RESULT_OUT:     .spec/app/results/frontend.json
PULSE_SCRIPT:   {PULSE_SCRIPT}
WATCH:          .spec/app/watch/current.json
```

That kit owns its own pulse files and the post-return check. After it returns, a frontend envelope `reason: stale-agent` blocks the frontend track. Ask once. Do not mark the track `done`.

Read `{dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/frontend-kit-result.json` (or `RESULT_OUT`). Apply the outcome table
to the **frontend track** (not individual `T-*` rows — that kit owns `task-checklist.md`).

### Station 6 — Report

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/orchestrate-app/scripts/write-kit-result.mjs \
  --out {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/app-kit-result.json \
  --kit orchestrate-app \
  --outcome approved \
  --spec-path {SPEC_PATH} \
  --prototype-ref "{PROTOTYPE_REF}" \
  --work-plan .spec/app/work-plan.md \
  --slug {slug} \
  --run-dir {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}
```

Report paths and counts only:

```
✅ App pipeline run for {slug}
Spec:       {SPEC_PATH}
Prototype:  {PROTOTYPE_REF or "skipped"}
Work plan:  .spec/app/work-plan.md
Tracks:     backend {status}, agent {status}, frontend {status}
Envelope:   {dirname(SPEC_PATH)}/app-kit-result.json
```

Remind `/create-pr` stays human-typed.

## Non-negotiables

1. Never bypass a delegated kit’s gate.
2. Progress lives in `work-plan.md` + `kit-result.json`.
3. Paths, not blobs.
4. One increment at a time (backend/agent). One frontend-orchestrator invocation.
5. Automation never ships.
