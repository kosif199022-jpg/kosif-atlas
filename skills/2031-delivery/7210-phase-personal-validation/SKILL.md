# Phase: Personal Validation — The Review Handoff

Open the reply with `delivery@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

Reusable **Personal Validation** handoff shared by every `flow-*` flow. It answers one
question for the person the run hands back to: *what do I open, and what am I looking for?*

**This skill presents; it never decides.** It brings the app up, publishes the links, and
writes the check list. The approve / revise / decline gate that follows it belongs to the
`flow-runner` agent and to `resources/flow-phases.md`, which is where the recorded decision,
the commit rule, and the unattended-run behaviour live. Nothing here can approve, skip, or
soften that gate.

## When To Run

- **Every tier**, after Validation for code-modifying flows and after the flow's own
  stages for documentation/config flows.
- **Again on every revise round.** A revised change set is a new thing to look at: re-run
  this whole skill rather than pointing back at the previous handback. The gate re-opens with
  `approval: "pending"` either way.
- **Inline, in the owner session.** No agent and no model — the links have to be clickable in
  the conversation the person is reading, and a sub-agent has no user turn to hand back to.

## Step 1 — Make Sure It Is Actually Running

A link to a process that is not listening is worse than no link.

- **Reuse the instance Validation left running** when there is one. Start a second only
  after confirming the first is gone.
- **Otherwise start it** with the `app.start` service — invoking the `run` skill when
  that is the provider — or the command QA proved this run. **Never hand the person a
  command to run themselves** — starting it is
  this phase's job, and stopping at a command list is a failed handback, not a shortcut.
- **Confirm health before publishing anything**, against the repository's
  `## Healthy` signals: the resources that must reach running, the health endpoints,
  the log lines that mean ready. Do not report its declared benign warnings as failures.
- **On a repeat pass, refresh over restart** where the repository's startup mode supports it,
  per **Revalidation After Requested Changes** in `skills/phase-validation/SKILL.md`.
  Record which one happened, and re-check the URLs — they move on a restart.
- **Startup failure blocks the phase.** Report the actual error and the recovery command;
  never hand back a review the person cannot perform.
- **Nothing to start** — a documentation/config flow, or a repository binding
  `extensions.app.start` to `null` — skips the startup and the links, says so in one line,
  and goes to Step 3 over the changed files.

## Step 2 — Publish The Links

- **Both places, every time.** Pass them as `links` on the stage so the surface renders
  buttons, **and** write them as clickable URLs in the conversation. A surface is never a
  dependency, and the person is reading the session either way.
- **Deep-link to what changed.** The route, page, or endpoint the change set touches — not
  the site root, which makes the person navigate to find it.
- **Then the supporting ones:** the runtime dashboard, the health endpoint, and any second
  surface the change reaches (an admin view, an API doc page, a queue UI).
- **Label each one** with what it is for, in the person's terms. A bare URL list is a
  navigation puzzle.
- **Publish nothing unconfirmed.** Every URL here was reachable in Step 1.

## Step 3 — Say What To Check

When the `show-me` skill is available, write this step and Step 4 per that skill.

The part no automated stage produces. A short numbered list, each item naming **where to
look, what to do, and what should happen.**

- **Derive it from the run's acceptance criteria and change set**, not from what QA already
  drove. QA's result is presented in Step 4; repeating it as homework wastes the one review a
  person actually performs.
- **Lead with what QA cannot judge** — layout, copy, spacing, tone, whether the thing is
  usable at all. Assertions are the suite's job; judgement is why this gate exists.
- **Name the non-obvious blast radius**: a migration that ran, a changed default, a shared
  component this change touched that another screen also uses.
- **Keep it to what fits in a few minutes.** A twenty-item list gets skimmed and approved.
  If it will not fit, the rest belongs in the automated suite, not in this list.
- **For a documentation/config flow**, list the chapters by path and the specific claim in
  each one to read for.

## Step 4 — Present The Reviews

- **The code review** of the change set, for the person to read.
- **The recorded QA review** when Validation ran: the scenarios in order, each with its
  pass/fail and its evidence, then the monitoring findings. When it was skipped, say so and
  why — never imply a result that was not produced.
- **Show image evidence; never only list it.** Display every screenshot, and every frame of a
  per-step sequence, inline in the conversation directly under its scenario's pass/fail,
  using whatever file or image display the host offers. Reading an image into your own
  context shows the person nothing — it has to reach their view. Only when the host cannot
  display images, give each path as a clickable link and say once why. Non-image evidence — a
  video, a trace, a log extract — stays a clickable path. Validation's sub-agent still returns
  paths only; this session is where the images are shown.

Then stop. Hand control back and wait. The decision, its recording, and everything downstream
of it are the gate's, in `resources/flow-phases.md`.

## Inputs

- The change set, the run's scope and acceptance criteria, and the change kind.
- The QA result and evidence from `phase-validation`, when that phase ran.
- The `app.start` result — base URLs and health verdict — and the path of the repository's
  `run` recipe when the flow-runner found one.

## Outputs

- A running application with confirmed health, or a `blocked` result naming the startup
  failure and the recovery command, or a recorded reason there was nothing to start.
- The labelled review links, in the stage's `links` and in the conversation.
- The what-to-check list, the code review, and the QA review.

## Dashboard Reporting

- Report as the `Personal Validation` stage via the shared **Reporting Contract** in
  `resources/surface-contract.md`, passing `links` for the started application and every
  review target. The flow-runner owns the `approval` values recorded with `set_run_context`.

## Agents

- **None.** This phase uses no agent and no model. Do not delegate it, and do not let a
  provider perform it on the run's behalf.
