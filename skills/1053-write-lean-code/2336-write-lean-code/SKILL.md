  Apply Lean 4 and Mathlib conventions whenever Lean is the subject: writing,
  reading, reviewing, naming, or proofs. For tests, use write-lean-tests.

# Write Lean Code

## Core Principles

1. **Type-driven development**: let the type system guide implementation; express invariants in types
1. **Leverage Mathlib**: use existing theorems, definitions, and tactics before building from scratch
1. **Tactic proofs for incremental feedback**: prefer tactic mode for complex proofs; use the VS Code infoview for step-by-step development
1. **Clarity and composability**: write small, focused lemmas; name them to be discoverable via `exact?` and `apply?`

## Skill dependencies

- **Required:** None
- **Optional:** `write-lean-tests`

## Workflow

1. In a fresh clone or worktree, run the project's documented bootstrap script before any direct `lake build`. Mathlib must come from `lake exe cache get` (prebuilt artifacts), not a local source compilation.
1. After bootstrap has succeeded in the current worktree, run `lake build <Module.Name>` to check compilation; run project linters if available.
1. **Update the tests in the same change as the proof code** if the project has a test suite that mirrors the proof code. Whenever you add, rename, restate, or delete anything on a module's public surface, update the matching test file in the same change. Treat the test suite as part of the proof code, not an optional extra. For the compile-time, `example`-based regression style those test modules typically use (import discipline, 1:1 naming mirror, composition per milestone, anti-patterns), invoke the `write-lean-tests` skill, the companion to this one. If it is not installed, update the matching tests directly and say that its conventions were not applied. `references/comprehensive/build-infrastructure.md` covers the `testDriver` / `defaultTargets` wiring side.
1. Before declaring a proof change finished, run the project's full local check (build + tests + any proof-boundary or lint checks the project defines).
1. Review against essential checklist: `references/essential/checklist.md`
1. For specific questions, consult: `references/comprehensive/{topic}.md`

## Project-Local Caveats

Each project using this skill should document its own bootstrap script, test-mirroring convention, namespace rules, and any vendored Lean dependencies that must be excluded from style searches. Read the invoking project's CLAUDE.md (or equivalent agent-config file) for those specifics before applying the generic guidance below.

**Vendored Lean dependencies are not style references.** When a project pulls in a third-party Lean library through `lake` (under `.lake/packages/<name>/` or the equivalent), that code is a build artifact, not a reference for Lean naming, proof style, tactic preferences, comment or docstring format, file structure, or math prose. Exclude such paths from grep-for-conventions searches. The invoking project's CLAUDE.md should name the specific packages to exclude.

Valid Lean references, in priority order: (1) the project's own code, (2) Mathlib under the project's Mathlib package path (search for both `theorem` and `lemma` declarations -- Mathlib uses both), (3) Lean core, and (4) the published documentation linked in the Sources section below.

**Mathlib build policy:** never use `lake build` as the first command in a clean worktree or clone. The supported bootstrap path runs `lake update`, downloads prebuilt Mathlib artifacts with `lake exe cache get`, verifies those artifacts exist, and only then builds the local libraries. If Mathlib artifacts are missing, rerun the project's bootstrap script rather than letting Lake compile Mathlib from source.

## Reference Navigation

**Quick reviews (default):**

- `references/essential/checklist.md`: condensed, actionable rules

**Deep dives by topic:**

- `references/comprehensive/naming.md`: identifiers, types, lemmas, files, Mathlib naming scheme
- `references/comprehensive/style-and-formatting.md`: indentation, imports, operators, sections
- `references/comprehensive/proof-style.md`: tactic vs term mode, structured proofs, automation, exploration tactics
- `references/comprehensive/mathlib.md`: documentation (module docstrings, tactic docs, citations, linting), variable conventions, API design, heartbeats
- `references/comprehensive/mathlib-api-discovery.md`: finding lemmas, navigating the module hierarchy, search strategies, common lookup patterns
- `references/comprehensive/general-programming.md`: type classes, monads, pattern matching, dependent types, IO, `lake`
- `references/comprehensive/build-infrastructure.md`: bootstrap script, Makefile target set, `lintDriver`, entrypoint manifest, `testDriver` vs `defaultTargets`, and test-library discipline for Mathlib-downstream projects
- `references/comprehensive/pfr-downstream.md`: finite-alphabet specialization, `noncomputable def` + `volume_tac`, measurability hygiene, and anonymous-constructor pair notation for projects built on PFR's entropy API
- `references/comprehensive/metaprogramming.md`: macros, custom tactics, syntax, elaboration, monad hierarchy

## Pull Request Review

When reviewing a pull request, apply `./references/review-checklist.md`: the rules of this guide that a reviewer can check in a diff, ranked as Important, Nits and Do not flag. The same checklist is installed into repositories for automated reviewers, so update it whenever a rule here changes.
