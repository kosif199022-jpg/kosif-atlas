Writes the engine keys only, never another component''s stamp, and never sets up a plugin this machine has not installed. Refused where .devbook/config.json already exists: run devbook-config:update.

# devbook-config init

Open the reply with `devbook-config@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

This file exceeds the 40-line body budget on purpose: it is one staged procedure — look, decide, write, validate, fan out — and a stage stated by half writes a config by half.

## Purpose

Turn a repository with no stack config into one the engine can run in. This runs **before any
component initializes itself**: the config is what a component's `init` reads to know what
it is installing into, so writing it first is the difference between a component asking the repository and a
component guessing.

This skill owns `id` and the four engine keys — `bindings`, `extensions`, `policy`, `gates` —
and nothing else. Every `components.<name>` entry belongs to that component's own `init` and
`update`, the only things that know what it materialized; writing one from here would
record work this skill did not do.

## Steps

1. **Look before writing.** Run `node scripts/report.mjs --root <repository>` from
   this plugin's root. If it reports a `.devbook/config.json` already present, or a
   `.github/ai-agent-stack.json` left from before the config moved, say "already
   initialized, run `devbook-config:update`" and stop — this skill is for the empty case.

2. **Decide which components this repository adopts.** Offer only what the report's scope
   table shows as `adoptable`, and `available` once the user enables it here. A plugin the
   report shows as not installed is never set up from here: say so in one line and move on.
   Installing it is the user's to do, and a stamp for a component this machine lacks would
   be `blocked` on the very next update. Ask; never impose a default shape.

3. **Write the config.** Set `id` to a name for the repository — lowercase, digits, hyphens;
   the repository name is usually right — and never rename it after: it is what a machine
   keys its own overlay for this repository on.

   The four engine keys are `delivery.*` settings and are written **only when `delivery` is
   among the components adopted in step 2**. Nothing else reads them, so a role or a point
   bound where no flow ever runs is a setting nobody maintains. Without delivery, the whole
   file is `{ "id": "<name>" }` plus step 4's grill binding; validate in step 5 only where
   delivery is installed, and skip step 6.

   With delivery: ask which roles, tracker, extension points, policy switches, and gates
   this repository really has a provider or a reason for. Bind a role only to a plugin the
   report shows installed and enabled, and an extension point only to a provider that
   exists here. An unset key takes the engine's documented default, which is almost always
   better than a binding nobody maintains. Start from the delivery plugin's
   `resources/config-template.json` — its checkout root is the report's catalog line, or the
   plugin's `installPath` from `--json` — and keep only the keys chosen. Read
   `resources/engine-contract.md` in that same plugin for what each point and gate means.
   Never put a model or a secret in this file.

4. **The change lane**, when `devbook-openspec` is among the components adopted in step 2.
   Ask its three questions, in this order:
   - **Is the OpenSpec CLI here?** Run `openspec --version`. Absent, print
     `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest` and wait until it answers; never run it
     yourself. Declined, the lane is not adopted and nothing below is written.
   - **Adopt the change lane?** A yes adds `changes` to what `devbook:init` adopts in step 7.
     With delivery adopted, write `"spec": "devbook-openspec:spec"` under
     `extensions` and `{ "provider": "devbook-openspec:tracker" }` as
     `bindings["delivery.tracker"]`, and offer the two optional gates in the bridge's
     README under *What the engine binds*.
   - **Grill an idea before proposing it?** Name the `plugin:skill` the person uses — it
     comes from another marketplace, so never propose one — and write it as
     `bindings["openspec.grill"]`, delivery or not. No answer is `null`.

5. **Validate.** Run that plugin's `tools/stack-config/check.mjs` against the file. An
   unknown key is an error, not a warning: a typo must never become a silently absent
   setting. Fix and re-run until it exits `0`.

   Write no overlay here: an overlay lives under the user's devbook config directory, is
   true of the person running this and of nobody they set a repository up for, and step 9
   offers `devbook-config:local`, which writes it.

6. **Declare the default MCP servers.** Every point left absent in step 3 takes the engine
   default — `microsoft-learn`, `aspire`, `playwright` — and a default is only a name until a
   host can start the server. The report's **MCP servers** lines say which of those ids
   `.mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, and `.github/mcp.json` already declare. When the
   repository has none of the three files, copy the delivery plugin's
   `resources/mcp-template.json` to `.mcp.json` and `resources/mcp-vscode-template.json` to
   `.vscode/mcp.json`; drop `aspire` and `playwright` when nothing here runs, and drop
   `microsoft-learn` when the stack is not Microsoft's. When a file exists, add only the
   missing ids in its own shape and change nothing else in it. These files are the
   repository's, unstamped, and never touched again by this plugin.

7. **Let each adopted component initialize itself.** For every component chosen in step 2,
   invoke that component's own `init` and let it materialize its payload and write its
   own stamp, in the order the report's reconcile list gives — `devbook:init` for the
   devbook folders, `devbook-derived:init` for the committed index, `devbook-openspec:init`
   for the change lane, `devbook-procedures:init`
   for the repository's `run`, `capture`, `diagnose`, `estimate`, and `prototype` skills,
   `delivery:init` for the engine's stamp, `delivery-schedule:init` for its schedules. Answer
   that one's adoption question from the engine keys just written: `extensions.app.start` of
   `null` drops `run` and `diagnose`; `policy.qa.depth` of `skipped` drops `capture`; no engine key answers `estimate` or `prototype`, so ask them. Do not copy a component's files
   by hand: a copy made here lands unstamped, and the next reconcile cannot tell it from a file someone deliberately customized.

8. **Verify.** Re-run the report and run `devbook-config:doctor`. An init that ends on a
   failing check is reported as failing, never as done.

9. **Offer `devbook-config:local`.** The report now says whether a user overlay and a
   model-selection file exist for the person running this. When neither does, say that the
   first flow here runs at the team's defaults, and offer to run `local` now. Their machine, their answer.

10. **Close on the setup report.** Fill [`../../resources/setup-report.md`](../../resources/setup-report.md)
    as the last thing in the reply: every component this run initialized under *This run*,
    with *Before* as `not adopted`, and what was deliberately left unbound, not installed and
    therefore not offered, or failing under *Still open*.

This skill is the empty case only. Everything about moving an already-configured repository
forward — version drift, migrations, the fan-out across components — belongs to
`devbook-config:update`, which runs the whole stack in one go.

## Do not

- Do not write, edit, or remove a `components.<name>` key. It is not yours.
- Do not set up, or ask about, a plugin the report shows as not installed. Report it; do not
  install it on the user's behalf.
- Do not write an engine key into a repository that is not adopting `delivery`. The grill
  binding is the change lane's, not the engine's, and is the one exception.
- Do not run `npm install`, or install the OpenSpec CLI any other way. Print the command.
- Do not write an overlay, at either of its layers. `devbook-config:local` does, for the
  person running it.
- Do not rewrite an existing MCP configuration file. Add a missing default id; never remove,
  rename, or reshape a server somebody declared.
- Do not invent a policy switch, an extension point, or a gate purpose. All three sets are
  closed and declared by the engine; configuration chooses among behaviour it already has.
- Do not remove a gate. Configuration may add one anywhere and may never take one away.
