# Finding Lifecycle

One entry per finding, carried by ID. The claim and falsifier are verbatim for the
whole run (R10).

## States

| State | Terminal | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| OPEN | no | raised, not yet answered |
| CHALLENGED | no | answered; the challenger has not yet replied or a closure was invalidated |
| RESOLVED_ACCEPT | yes | respondent accepted; becomes a concrete edit in the verdict |
| RESOLVED_REFUTE | yes | refuted with positive evidence satisfying the falsifier as stated |
| RESOLVED_WITHDRAWN | yes | challenger withdrew, naming the evidence that falsified it |
| STANDOFF | yes | both substantive positions survive the available evidence (R11) |
| UNTESTABLE | yes | falsifier inadmissible after one restatement (R9) |
| TRANSMISSION_ARTIFACT | yes | the finding attacks material absent from the source (R15) |
| CERTIFICATION_FAILED | yes | closure invalidated at certification, no round budget left (R12) |

STANDOFF is reserved for substantive survival. A procedural failure routes to
UNTESTABLE, TRANSMISSION_ARTIFACT, or CERTIFICATION_FAILED, never to STANDOFF.

## Transitions

- OPEN -> CHALLENGED: the respondent answers with ACCEPT, REFUTE, NEEDS-EVIDENCE, or
  DISAGREE, plus evidence at a locator for every non-ACCEPT verdict.
- CHALLENGED -> RESOLVED_*: the challenger concedes (naming the falsifying evidence)
  or the respondent accepts.
- CHALLENGED -> STANDOFF: evidence saturation, or the round cap, whenever the
  respondent's position is not a refutation (labeled saturation or cap-terminated).
- CHALLENGED -> CHALLENGED, proposed RESOLVED_REFUTE: evidence saturation, or the
  round cap, whenever the respondent's position is a refutation. Not STANDOFF: a
  surviving refutation is not both substantive positions surviving (R11). The
  finding is flagged saturated or cap-terminated and carries to certification, the
  only place RESOLVED_REFUTE is assigned (R12).
- any non-terminal -> UNTESTABLE: falsifier fails admissibility twice.
- any -> TRANSMISSION_ARTIFACT: the attacked material is absent from the source at
  the recorded digest.
- proposed RESOLVED_REFUTE -> CHALLENGED: substantiated MISREPRESENTED flag at
  certification. One corrective round if budget remains, else CERTIFICATION_FAILED.
- A withdrawal that names no falsifying evidence does not close the finding: it stays
  CHALLENGED and the verdict reports the unexplained withdrawal as a run weakness.

## Saturation test (mechanical, run per finding per round)

new evidence since previous round = NO on both sides
AND both positions unchanged
=> no further rounds for this finding. If the respondent's position is REFUTE, the
   finding stays CHALLENGED, flagged saturated, and carries to certification as a
   proposed refutation. Otherwise it becomes STANDOFF now (R11).
