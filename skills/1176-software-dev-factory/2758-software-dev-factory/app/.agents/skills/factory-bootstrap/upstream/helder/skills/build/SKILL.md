description: Implement one phase of a plan — reads the plan, finds the next incomplete phase, implements it with feedback loops, marks checkboxes, offers a commit (one phase per invocation). Use after /plan when a plan exists at `.specs/plans/<slug>.md`, or when the user asks to build or implement the next phase. Don't use for ad-hoc changes with no plan (use /tdd) or to check progress (use /test).

# Build Phase

Implement the next incomplete phase of a plan — one phase per invocation.

**Context window**: recommend `/clear` before starting to maximize token budget.

**Interactive prompts**: present options as a numbered list and wait for the user's choice.

## Input

The argument (if provided) is: $ARGUMENTS

Use argument as `<slug>`. If empty, list plans as numbered options and wait for the user's choice.

Accepts a slug or an `@path` reference — `@` means read that file directly as the plan (e.g. `/build @.specs/plans/dark-mode-support.md`).

## Workflow

### 1. Load the plan

Read `.specs/plans/<slug>.md`. If missing, list plans as numbered options and wait for the user's choice.

### 2. Find the next incomplete phase

Scan the plan for `## Phase N` headings. For each phase, count `- [ ]` and `- [x]` checkboxes.

The **next incomplete phase** is the first phase that has at least one unchecked `- [ ]` item.

If all phases are complete (zero unchecked items across all phases):

> All phases complete. Run `/test <slug>` to verify.

Stop here.

### 3. Present the phase

Show the phase title and its unchecked items:

```
Phase N — <title> (M remaining)
- [ ] First unchecked item
- [ ] Second unchecked item
```

### 4. Offer a feature branch

If on the default branch (main/master), ask:

> Create branch `feat/<slug>`?
>
> 1. Yes, create branch (Recommended)
> 2. No, stay on current branch

If accepted, create and switch to the branch.

If already on a feature branch, skip this step.

### 5. Implement the phase

Work through each unchecked item in order. For each item:

1. Read the plan's architectural decisions and the current item's context
2. Explore relevant code to understand existing patterns and conventions
3. Implement the change — follow the project's conventions (CLAUDE.md, linter config, test setup)
4. Write tests alongside implementation (follow the project's existing test patterns)

**Do not** impose coding rules, style, or conventions. Follow what the project already uses.

**Do not** implement items from other phases. Stay within the current phase boundary.

### 6. Run feedback loops

After implementing the phase, detect and run the project's checks — type check, tests, lint, format. Detect the toolchain from the manifest and prefer tasks the project already defines (see the detection table in [validate-code](../validate-code/SKILL.md)):

| Ecosystem | Manifest | Checks (run what exists) |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Node      | `package.json` scripts | `typecheck`/`tsc`, `test`, `lint`, `format:check` |
| Python    | `pyproject.toml`/`Makefile` | `mypy`, `pytest`, `ruff`, `black --check` |
| Go        | `go.mod` | `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, `go vet`, `gofmt -l` |
| Rust      | `Cargo.toml` | `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check` |

Run each detected check. If any fails:

1. Read the error output
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the failing script
4. Repeat until all pass (max 3 attempts per script)

If a script still fails after 3 attempts, treat it as a **blocker** — pause and ask the user for help:

> **Blocker**: `<script>` fails after 3 attempts.
> Last error: `<error summary>`
>
> How to proceed?
>
> 1. I'll fix it — pause and wait
> 2. Skip this check and continue
> 3. Abort this phase

Wait for the user's response before continuing.

### 7. Mark checkboxes

After all feedback loops pass, for each completed item change `- [ ]` → `- [x]` in `.specs/plans/<slug>.md`.

### 8. Offer commit

Present the changes and ask:

> Phase N complete — all checks pass. Commit?
>
> 1. Yes, commit
> 2. No, I'll review first

If the user chooses to commit:

1. Stage the implementation files (not `.specs/` artifacts unless the project commits its specs)
2. Create a commit with a message following the project's commit conventions
3. Confirm: "Committed. Run `/build <slug>` for Phase N+1, or `/test <slug>` to verify."

If the user chooses to review:

> Ready for review. Run `/build <slug>` again when ready to continue.

### 9. Blockers during implementation

If implementation requires something the agent cannot provide (API key, external service, manual setup, design decision):

> **Blocker**: <description of what's needed>
>
> How to proceed?
>
> 1. I've resolved it — continue
> 2. Skip this item for now
> 3. Abort this phase

Wait for the user's response. Never guess or work around a blocker silently.

## Rules

- **Never modify spec content** — the spec is read-only
- **Never modify plan content** beyond marking checkboxes `[x]`
- **Never impose conventions** — follow the project's existing setup
- **Do not push to remote** — only commit locally
