name: spec
effort: high
description: Create a spec (PRD) through user interview, codebase exploration, and module design. Use when starting a feature with unclear requirements, when the user asks to spec or define what to build, or says "write a spec" or "write a PRD". Don't use when requirements are crisp and a plan already exists (use /plan or /build).

# Spec

Skip satisfied steps. If argument provided, skip to Step 2.

**Interactive prompts**: present options as a numbered list and wait for the user's choice.

## Input

The argument is: $ARGUMENTS

If empty, go to Step 1; derive slug after gathering the idea. If provided, derive slug:

1. Take only the text before the first `—` or `–` (if present)
2. Strip leading command verbs: create, build, implement, add, update, fix, make, write, plan, get, show, support
3. Lowercase the text
4. Remove filler words: a, an, the, for, of, to, in, on, with, and, or, but, is, be
5. Take the first 4 remaining words (or fewer if less exist)
6. Join with hyphens → `<slug>`

Output: `.specs/specs/<slug>.md`. If file exists, present options and wait:

1. Overwrite existing (Recommended)
2. Pick a new name

## Workflow

### 1. Gather problem description

Ask the user for a detailed description of the problem and any solution ideas.

### 2. Explore codebase

Map current state: data models, services, API routes, frontend, tests. Note exists vs. must build.

**Research protocol**: codebase first, then docs. Unverifiable claims → flag as uncertain, never fabricate.

### 3. Interview

One question at a time. Lead with your recommended answer (mark it `(Recommended)` and list first). Explore code instead of asking when possible. Present 2–4 options for each question — structured choices are faster than free-text.

| Branch           | Key questions                           | Skip when                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Scope & Surface  | Where? New page or integrated? Roles?   | CLI/library, no new entry points |
| Data & Concepts  | Definitions, existing vs missing data   | Never skip                       |
| Behavior         | Interaction patterns, filtering, search | No user-facing behavior          |
| Display          | Numbers, tables, charts, exports        | No UI                            |
| Access & Privacy | Who sees what? Sensitive data?          | Single-user, no auth             |
| Boundaries       | Out of scope, deferred features         | Never skip                       |
| Integration      | Schema, services, external deps         | Self-contained change            |

### 3b. Gray areas

Surface ambiguities, contradictions, unstated assumptions. For each gray area, present proposed resolution options. Resolve all before continuing.

### 4. Design modules

Sketch modules. Favor **deep modules** — simple interface (1-3 entry points) hiding large implementation over shallow modules where interface ≈ implementation.

Shallow signals: many small 1:1 functions, callers compose multiple calls, feature changes require interface changes.

Present modules. Confirm which need tests.

### 5. Write spec

Save to `.specs/specs/<slug>.md` (create dir if missing).

```markdown
# Feature Name
```

Spec body structure. Omit empty sections. No file paths or code snippets.

```
## Problem Statement
## Current State (skip if greenfield)
## Solution (user experience, not architecture)
## User Stories (numbered, cover happy + edge + error)
## Implementation Decisions
### New Modules (name, purpose, interface signatures)
### Architectural Decisions (definitions, data flow, state)
### Schema Changes
### API Contracts
### Navigation
## Testing Decisions (behavior tests, key cases, prior art)
## Out of Scope (be specific)
```

Present options and wait for the user's choice:

1. Run `/plan <slug>` (Recommended)
2. Done for now
