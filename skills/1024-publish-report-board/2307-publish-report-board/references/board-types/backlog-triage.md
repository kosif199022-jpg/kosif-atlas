# Backlog Triage Board

A backlog triage board answers three questions about a repository's open issues: what to start now, what can run in parallel, and what is blocked and by what. It suits a backlog worked by several branches or sessions at once, where the binding constraint is less what matters most than what can proceed without colliding.

## Gather

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url,defaultBranchRef
git fetch --quiet --prune origin
git rev-parse origin/DEFAULT_BRANCH
gh issue list --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,body,labels,milestone,assignees,createdAt,updatedAt
gh api --paginate --slurp 'repos/OWNER/REPO/milestones?state=open&per_page=100' | jq 'add'
gh pr list --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,headRefName,closingIssuesReferences
git worktree list
git branch --list --format='%(refname:short)'
git branch --remotes --no-merged origin/DEFAULT_BRANCH
gh api user --jq '.login'
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
```

Every open issue goes on the board, and every open pull request can mark work in progress. If either list returns exactly as many items as `--limit` allows, raise the limit and run it again rather than working from a truncated list. The milestones call is paginated for the same reason: GitHub caps a page at 100 and returns only the first one otherwise, so `--slurp` gathers the pages and `add` flattens them into a single list.

The unmerged remote branches catch work pushed from another machine or session, which is why the fetch takes every branch and prunes the deleted ones. They are also what a branch blocker points at: a branch holding unmerged work with no pull request is often the reason an issue cannot finish.

Those names arrive carrying their remote, as `origin/feature`. Record a branch blocker as the branch alone, `feature`, because the page builds a compare link from it and `origin/feature` names no branch on GitHub.

## Analyze

Work through these steps in order; each one uses the results of the one before.

### 1. Work in Progress

Detect it the way the `suggest-next-issue` skill does. An issue is in progress when a branch or worktree name contains its number, when it carries an "in progress" label, or when it is assigned to the current user. An open pull request that closes it also counts. Set `inProgress` to what carries the work: a branch name, `PR #390`, or, when only a label or an assignment says so, that signal itself, such as `the in progress label` or `assigned to you`. Write a signal as a phrase rather than one word. The page links `PR #390` to its pull request and any single unspaced value to a branch comparison, so a bare `in-progress` is drawn as a branch that does not exist, while a phrase stays as text. Every issue the board counts as in progress needs the field, because the page and validation read nothing else.

### 2. Dependencies

Scan each body for references to other open issues, such as "blocked by #N", "depends on #N", "after #N", or "needs #N", and confirm that each is an ordering constraint rather than a passing mention. Record it as `waitingOn`, with `blockedBecause` saying what the blocker settles.

An issue can also wait on something that is not an open issue on this board: a pull request, a branch that has to merge, an issue in another repository, or anything else with a URL. Record each as a reference, as [References](#references) describes, rather than in a lane note, so the board counts the issue as blocked and links to what it waits on. Drop blockers that have closed or merged: a finished blocker is no longer a reason.

Some constraints are soft: an issue could start now, but starting it before another open issue lands would repeat work or force a rebase. Record those in `after` rather than `waitingOn`. It takes the same forms, so the thing to wait for can also be a pull request, a branch, or another repository's issue. The board shows the relation, counts the issue as queued rather than blocked, and never picks it to start now. Within a serial lane the listed order already says this, so `after` earns its place mostly across lanes.

### 3. Footprints and Contention

For each issue, work out what it will edit: plugins, packages, directories, or shared files, from the paths and names in its body. A component that two or more issues will edit is a claim, and each claim is a rebase waiting to happen.

List the claims under `contention.claims`, each naming the component and the issues that claim it, and set `contention.rowLabel` to what the components are, such as `Plugin` or `Package`. Leave out components only one issue claims, and files that nearly every change touches trivially, such as a changelog or a version tag; mention those in a lane note instead.

### 4. Lanes

Group the issues into lanes so that two issues in different lanes never edit the same component. Start from the claims: issues linked through shared components belong together. Every open issue goes in exactly one lane, including issues without a milestone and issues in progress, and validation rejects a board that leaves one out.

Give each lane a mode:

| Mode     | Meaning                                                                  | Use when                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serial` | One branch at a time: the first issue in the listed order that can start | Every issue edits something another issue in the lane also edits             |
| `head`   | The first issue alone, then everything it frees at once                  | One issue settles something the rest read, and after it they are independent |
| `any`    | Every issue that can start at once, so blocked and queued work waits     | Nothing in the lane shares a component                                       |

In a serial lane the listed order is the recommended sequence, with an issue already in progress first; an issue that cannot start yet is passed over for the next one that can. In a head lane the head comes first, and while it cannot start, nothing else in the lane does. In either, work already in progress holds the lane's single slot, including work on an issue riding another's branch. When more than one branch in such a lane is already in progress, the page shows each one running, so the overlap stays visible. In an any-order lane the order is only for reading.

When two issues should ship on one branch, usually because neither makes sense without the other, set `sameBranchAs` on one of them to the other. Both must sit in the same lane, and the page draws them as one unit.

Give each lane a short `key` (`L1`, `L2`, and so on), a `name` a reader recognizes, `owns` listing what it edits, and a `note` saying why its order is what it is.

### 5. Start Now

Pick the branches to open today: at most one per serial or head lane, and never an issue that is blocked, in progress, better after another open issue, or riding on another issue's branch. A serial or head lane whose single slot is held by an issue in progress gets no pick, and otherwise its pick is the issue the page runs there: a head lane's head, or a serial lane's first issue that can start. Prefer issues that unblock others, carry the most risk while they stay open, or head a contended lane, and use the signals the `suggest-next-issue` skill weighs to break ties: priority labels, dependencies, age from `createdAt`, and recent activity from `updatedAt`. Order the picks by value, and give each a `why` and a `touches` naming what it edits.

How many branches to start is a judgment, not a maximum. The header already shows how many could run at once; the picks say how many are worth starting. When the two differ, say why in `notes.startNow`.

### 6. Prose

Write `summary`, each lane's `note`, each `blockedBecause`, and any section notes following `./references/design-conventions.md`.

### References

Each `waitingOn` or `after` entry is an open issue number on this board, or an object naming exactly one of these:

| Form                                       | Waits on                                       | Links to                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `{ "pr": 390 }`                            | A pull request in this repository              | The pull request                           |
| `{ "branch": "fix/remove-floating-tags" }` | A branch in this repository that has to merge  | The branch compared with the synced branch |
| `{ "ref": "OWNER/REPO#17" }`               | An issue or pull request in another repository | That issue or pull request                 |
| `{ "url": "https://…", "label": "…" }`     | Anything else                                  | The URL, under the label                   |

Any form may add a `title`, which the Blocked section shows beside the link, and a `url` reference carries its required `label` as well. That section's "Freed from" column names the lane for an issue on the board, and the kind of reference otherwise. In `after`, the same forms name what an issue is better started after, and its lane row links each one.

| Start now         | Each pick with its reasons, lane, footprint, and milestone          | The issues that share its branch                                                                                                |
| Lanes             | A bar per lane with one segment per issue, then each lane in detail | Capacity from the mode; which segments can run now; "waits on", "unblocks", "better after", "eases", and "same branch as" links |
| Contention matrix | Claimed components down the side, milestones across                 | The columns, from the milestones of the claiming issues; the counts in the note                                                 |
| Blocked           | Each blocked issue, what it waits on, why, and what frees it        | The order, fewest blockers first; the freeing lane, or the kind of reference                                                    |
| Footer            | The sync line and counts                                            | The milestone count                                                                                                             |

Capacity follows the lane's mode: one branch at a time for a serial or head lane, and every unblocked issue at once for an any-order lane. A serial lane runs its first issue that can start, and a head lane only its head, so a head that cannot start holds its whole lane at zero. A head lane also shows how many issues its head frees. It shows that count while the head is running, whether the head is the pick or its branch is already in progress, and zero when the head is not running at all. What it counts is every issue in the lane that the head releases, and the lane itself is what holds the rest back until the head lands: an issue with no blockers of its own is therefore counted, while one that also waits on something outside the head's branch is not, because the head landing does not free it. A branch already in progress beside the head is running now rather than waiting on the head, so it is not counted. A rider kept back by a blocker of its own frees nothing either. "Branches at once" in the header is the sum across lanes. A branch carrying an issue that is better after another open issue counts as queued rather than runnable, so it adds nothing to capacity until its target lands, unless its work has already started.

When no open issue has a milestone, the page drops the milestone column and chips, heads the contention matrix's single column "Claimed by", and says so in the footer rather than counting zero milestones.

When nothing is blocked, the Blocked section shrinks to its heading and the words "Nothing is blocked." An empty `startNow` shrinks the Start now section the same way, to a line saying whether anything could have started. `notes.blocked` and `notes.startNow` replace either line when set.

## Validation

`report-board validate` rejects data that breaks any of these rules, and lists every problem at once:

- Every open issue sits in exactly one lane, and lanes list only issues on the board.
- `waitingOn` lists open issues on the board, never the issue itself, or well-formed references, and always comes with `blockedBecause`.
- `after` lists open issues on the board or well-formed references, never the issue itself, never an issue it already waits on or shares a branch with, and never forms a loop.
- `sameBranchAs` names an issue in the same lane that does not itself ship on another branch.
- A start pick is on the board, and is not blocked, not in progress (counting work on an issue riding its branch), not better after another open issue, and not riding on another issue's branch; nothing riding on its own branch is better after another open issue either.
- A serial or head lane gets at most one pick, none while work in progress holds its slot, and only the issue the page runs there: a head lane's head, or a serial lane's first issue that can start.
- `sync.at` falls on a real calendar date, `sync.commit` is a full SHA, and `sync.timeZone`, when set, is a zone the time zone database has, wherever one is installed.
- Required fields are present and well formed, including each issue's `milestone`, which is `null` when it has none. Issue numbers, lane keys, and claim names are unique, and every `mode` is `serial`, `head`, or `any`.
