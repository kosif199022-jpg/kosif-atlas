# Elenchus Protocol

Vet working context by dialectical antithesis before action: each suspect claim is met by a concrete challenge, and the user's own answer to it is what the context carries forward, resolving suspect context into vetted context. Type: `(ContextSuspect, User, VET, WorkingContext) → VettedContext`.

## Definition

**Elenchus** (ἔλεγχος): A dialogical act of cross-examination — from the Socratic refutation tradition meaning "testing by argument" — resolving suspect working context into vetted context through provenance challenge, counterfactual gap forecasting, cross-source consistency check, and inference-fallacy archetype scan before pre-execution sync. The protocol's lexical verb is `/sublate`. Each claim the pending action leans on is stated as it stands (thesis), met by what would shake it (antithesis), and then the person says what they make of it in light of that challenge (synthesis) — the Hegelian *Aufhebung*, preserve + negate + lift up, supplies the source vocabulary. The protocol exists to help that thinking reach its synthesis; the synthesis is the person's.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

structure Indicator where

/-- A claim under vetting: the turn that carries its source — by index, since the assistant's own
    earlier output can be a source — the claim that source is read as authority for, what makes
    it suspect, and the evidence for that. -/
structure Claim where
  source    : Nat
  claim     : ClaimRef
  suspicion : String
  evidence  : List Indicator

/-- **Your judgment**, made afresh on every pass: the claims the pending action leans on that
    warrant a challenge, read from the context as it now stands and from this run's invocation on.
    A working order that serves it: identify the sources that warrant a look — unusually
    load-bearing, older than the horizon for their origin, reached through a long provenance chain,
    in tension with another source about the same referent, or an inference used as a premise — then
    bind each to the claim it is read as authority for, and split a binding that bundles several
    distinct claims, one claim each; where the suspicion cannot be factored per claim, it was one
    claim after all. One claim standing on evidence in several places is one claim. Binding is
    total: a source whose claim you cannot settle still yields a claim, whose owner the
    certificate then finds unclear, so nothing selected is dropped silently. The person's words
    about what to vet are part of the context: a correction of the target moves it on the next
    pass. Whether a claim is the same one an earlier pass selected is your judgment too — changed
    wording alone does not make it new, and a claim that continues after a split is still that
    claim for whatever it owes. The list is the run's: a claim once selected in this run stays in
    it with whatever answered it, and a correction of the target adds what it points at beside
    the claims already there. What an earlier run or session selected is not this run's. -/

    vetting it here can carry it to a vetted context; a pass certifies admissibility here, not
    the absence of a claim anywhere else — where two protocols' scopes both reach, each one's own
    gate governs. Evidence that supports no claim, or several, leaves it unclear, and an unclear
    claim is put to the person like any other, never dropped. The person's words about whose a

    answer reaches the claim it covers: changed wording alone does not void it, while a
    materially changed claim, or a fresh antithesis, is not covered by an answer given before it.
    A correction of the target answers the claims it sets aside, in the person's words. Where the

A pass is the silent work: it judges afresh which claims warrant a challenge, whose each one is,
and how each stands; it makes the verification reads, and posits an antithesis for each claim that
waits on the person and has none its state has not outrun. The reads enter the context, then the
pass's record. Either a closure fires, or `respond` presents the round. Each person utterance is
fused, and the next pass reads it.

/-- `respond` presents the round. First the current list: every claim of this run, each with its
    source and how it stands — waiting on the person, answered with what they said, or handed on
    by the certificate with its fit and the command only as a hint. Then what this turn changed:
    what the person's turn answered, what is newly found or re-targeted, a claim challenged afresh
    because a condition the person set is now met. Then every open claim: its source and the
    claim verbatim, what makes it suspect, the evidence with its channel, what the pending action
    stakes on it, its tags, the antithesis with its basis, and the certificate's fit — for an
    unclear owner, that the evidence also supports the other deficits it names — then `actions`,
    each with its consequence; a few at a time where there are many, around four, so each is read.
    Wherever a person's earlier turn is read as the answer to a claim,

/-! ── LOOP ──
Every utterance opens a pass over the fused context: an answer, a correction of the target, a
question, a closing, read whole. Nothing counts rounds or batches; every pass judges the claims
against the whole context again, so what is open is whatever the context leaves open. A condition
the person set that the context now shows met leaves its claim open again, with a fresh
antithesis. The loop is dialogue: each round ends at a gate, and the person ends the run.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
Every closure is read where it fires and nowhere else. vetted: nothing open, and the person
closed — by answers of theirs in this run, read from any of their turns, or by saying the run is
done after seeing the list, which is the only way a run closes where nothing was found or every
claim was handed on by the certificate alone. stopped: what was open stays unanswered. routed: the
person named the next protocol. The vetted context claims no more than the claims this run
selected; an answer carries the person's words and no category the AI assigned to them.
Convergence evidence: for each claim an antithesis was put to, every antithesis in cycle order —
the claim it was put to → the antithesis with its basis → the answer that met it, quoted, with a
later answer that replaced it shown beside it — naming the source; apart from the trace, every
claim the certificate handed on, with its fit and hint; the conditions left unmet, reported open;
and the dissent attached to the closure. Demonstrated, not asserted.

## Mode Activation

`/sublate` is user-invoked over an existing working context before an action that depends on it is externalized or committed. Elenchus has no AI-guided activation: a model may answer an explicit invocation, but it does not initiate vetting from its own suspicion. Loaded safety boundaries, capability restrictions, and explicit user instructions continue to bind. The run begins at the invocation: what an earlier run or session selected, answered, or set as a condition belongs to that run, and the context carries it only as material.

## Source Identification Criteria

A source is worth a look when it is unusually load-bearing, older than the horizon appropriate to its origin, supported through a long provenance chain, in tension with another source about the same referent, or itself an inference being used as a premise — the assistant's own earlier output included. Thresholds and origin horizons remain working hypotheses; an emergent criterion may be used when it directly identifies suspect context.

## Antithesis Rendering

Render the pattern that directly challenges the claim:

- **Provenance**: test whether the source's verification path authorizes this claim. Freshness does not settle support-integrity when nothing couples the source to the behavior it asserts.
- **Counterfactual**: use a condition the user has put in play to show where the current conclusion could fail.
- **Cross-source**: compare separate sources only after their referent and claim-kind are compatible. Claims split from one source are not a source pair.
- **Inference**: test the reasoning that produced a conclusion. Time-invariance from a present observation, over-generalization, surviving-sample reasoning, base-rate neglect, and correlation-as-cause are recognition seeds rather than a closed catalog; an emergent archetype remains available.

Counterfactual rendering begins with the user's changed condition. Inference rendering reverse-derives the condition that would expose a reasoning flaw. Every antithesis is a concrete counter-claim, counter-condition, counter-source, or counter-inference with a cited basis.

## Protocol

The formal block defines execution. This section fixes the user-facing rendering.

### The round

Open every round with the current list: each claim under vetting, its source, and how it stands now — waiting on you, what you said about it, or handed to another protocol with why. Follow it with what this turn changed: what your last answer settled, what is newly found, what moved because you corrected the target, and any claim challenged again because a condition you set is now met.

Then present every open claim, a few at a time where there are many. For each, before the question: the source and the claim verbatim, what makes it suspect, the evidence and where it came from, what the pending action stakes on it, the provenance and freshness reading, and the antithesis with its basis. Where the owner is unclear, say which other kinds of problem the evidence also supports; the antithesis is then provisional.

The question asks what you make of each claim in light of its challenge. The options are concrete actions for that claim, each with what then happens — never category titles:

```
"The staging DB mirrors prod schema" — from the runbook (edited 2025-11)
  suspect   the migration you plan assumes it; the runbook predates two prod migrations
  challenge prod ran migrations 0412 and 0419 after that edit; nothing shows staging received them

What do you make of it?
1. Stop relying on the runbook for this — check the staging schema before migrating
2. Look again once 0419 is confirmed on staging — the claim is re-challenged then
3. It holds — say why, and the migration proceeds on it
```

Answer in your own words; one answer may cover several claims, or only some of them — what it leaves stays open for the next round. An answer is recorded in your words, instructions included. Saying the claim is another protocol's matter hands it there — with the command as a hint where this protocol names one, and as you named it otherwise; nothing is dispatched. Saying the target itself is wrong moves what is vetted on the next pass.

With nothing open, show what was searched and what was found — including every claim handed elsewhere, with why — and ask whether the run is done; an ordinary reply closes it, and you may name something to vet instead. Wherever an earlier answer of yours is read as covering a claim, or as what lets the run close, say which turn was read and what was taken from it, quoting your words — this disclosure stands in place of asking again.

## Rules

- **User-initiated only**: Activate only on the user's pre-execution vetting invocation over existing working context.
- **Antithesis before synthesis**: Every open claim is met by a concrete challenge — a counter-claim, counter-condition, counter-source, or counter-inference with its cited basis — shown before the user is asked what they make of it. Where no concrete challenge can be constructed, say so with the attempted pattern and basis, so the claim stays visible in the closing account.
- **The answer is the user's, in their words**: A claim is answered only by the user's turn, whatever its form, and that answer stands over anything the certificate read. It is recorded as said, with no category assigned to it; instructions, conditions, and orders it carries are read from those words.
- **Recognition over categories**: Offer actions concrete to the claim in front of the user, each with its consequence. Where one question covers several claims, each claim's actions open with one line stating that claim so it reads without the material above, and the actions are numbered once across the question, so each number in an answer reaches exactly one action. The user's own words settle what a category would have asked them to choose.
- **Round composition**: Compose each round so the reader can act on it without reassembling it — everyday language rather than this file's formal vocabulary, each judgment beside the evidence it rests on together with the differential implication that matters for the next move, and analytical context laid out before the question rather than inside it. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when a term's rendering has to hold across the session or wording has to be carried through unchanged, when some of what is in view belongs to a later round or a trace rather than this one, or when this protocol's own round bears on where a sentence sits relative to the question.
- **Judge afresh every pass**: Which claims are vetted, whose each one is, and which answer covers which claim are read from the whole context as it now stands. A correction of the target moves what is vetted; a condition the user set that is now met re-opens its claim with a fresh challenge; changed wording alone does not void an answer.
- **Source chain preservation**: The working context is read and never rewritten. An answer reaches its source only as authority for the claim it answered; other claims from the same source stand on their own answers.
- **Claim-relative provenance**: A provenance reading authorizes one claim. Same-referent comparison requires compatible claim kinds and separate sources; a source used for several claims yields separately answered claims.
- **Currency and support-integrity**: A current source still receives a provenance antithesis when no observable coupling ties it to the behavior its claim asserts.
- **Open inference archetypes**: The named reasoning flaws seed recognition without closing Pattern D to an emergent flaw condition.
- **Unclear owners are shown, never dropped**: A claim the certificate cannot place is presented with a provisional challenge and the other deficits its evidence supports; the user's answer places it. A claim the certificate alone places elsewhere is reported with its fit and the command only as a hint.
- **The user closes**: Nothing closes on the first pass. Where nothing was found, or every claim was handed elsewhere by the certificate alone, the run ends only when the user replies after seeing what was found. Contrary ground still held when the user answers over it is attached to the closure record.
- **Declared continuation relay**: A user-declared chain settles the protocol after Elenchus; this contract declares no outbound edge. Cite that source and preserve every Constitution gate inside both protocols.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request and carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
