description: Pre-push review mirroring CI code-review@v8 (+ Jev) so first push stays clean. Reviews correctness, security, performance, test coverage, doc accuracy, and tight assertions, then records push-review state. Use before pushing a feature branch, when asked to review before push, or when pr-babysit needs a reviewer. Explicit — does NOT auto-fire on edits.

# toolu-review:review

A pre-push reviewer tuned to what this repo's CI Toolu Code Review action
(`falconiere/toolu-ghactions/code-review@v8`, Jev-enabled; posts as
`github-actions[bot]`) flags — run it locally so the verdict is clean on the
first push instead of bouncing low/nit findings back as rework.

## What it reviews

Review `git diff <base>...HEAD` against these dimensions. Every finding blocks
(the gate requires zero) — fix in code, do not suppress:

1. **Correctness** — logic, edge cases, error handling (no swallowed errors, no
   `@ts-ignore`/`eslint-disable`/`#[allow]` papering over a real problem).
2. **Security** — input validation, injection, secrets, unsafe file/symlink ops.
3. **Performance** — hot paths (e.g. per-render/per-hook work), needless spawns.
4. **Test coverage for every NEW behavior** — a new code path without a colocated
   real-data test is a finding. Use a Bun test for TypeScript behavior; retain
   Bats coverage for legacy scripts until #279 removes them.
5. **Doc/comment accuracy** — comments must match behavior; e.g. no "one-time" on
   a block that runs every invocation; no stale paths after a move.
6. **Tight test assertions** — assert the full identity, not a loose suffix
   (`*/statusline/statusline.sh`, not `*/statusline.sh`).
7. **In-session migration WARNs** — a breaking change (moved path, removed symlink)
   must surface an actionable in-session hint, not a silent failure later.
8. **Convention adherence** — follow `AGENTS.md` / related convention files the CI
   action reads from the base ref (same bar as `code-review@v8`).

## How to run

**Commit the fix first, then review.** The gate binds `git diff <base>...HEAD` —
the *committed* diff. State recorded while a fix is still uncommitted describes
the pre-fix tree, so committing staleifies it and the push denies.

1. Resolve the diff: `git diff --no-color <base>...HEAD` (base = the push-review
   gate's base; the helper below resolves it the same way).
2. Review every changed hunk against the checklist. Read surrounding code and
   grep for usage before claiming a finding — no speculative nits.
3. Fix accepted findings in code, commit them, re-review until none remain.
4. Record the clean state for the push-review gate:

   ```bash
   # Codex
   TOOLU_HOST_OVERRIDE=codex \
     "${TOOLU_CONFIG_DIR:-${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}}/toolu-review/write-state.sh" \
     --findings-count 0 --reviewers '["toolu-review:review"]'

   # Claude Code
   TOOLU_HOST_OVERRIDE=claude \
     "${TOOLU_CONFIG_DIR:-${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}}/toolu-review/write-state.sh" \
     --findings-count 0 --reviewers '["toolu-review:review"]'
   ```

   Pass `--branch <name>` on a detached checkout — pr-babysit's
   `git worktree add --detach` + `git push origin HEAD:<name>` contract — so
   the state file is keyed to the branch the push targets; the push-review gate
   resolves that same branch from the refspec. Omitting it there fails with
   "not on a branch (detached HEAD?)".
   Pass `--repo <path>` when the reviewed checkout is not the session's cwd —
   a worktree, say. The gate reads the state file under the **pushed repo's own
   root**, so a file written anywhere else is invisible to it. `--repo` defaults
   to the cwd's repo root and the script fails with "not inside a git repo" when
   the path given is not one. `$STATE_DIR`, when set, overrides the directory for
   the writer and the gate alike.

   `write-state.sh` is published below the active host's explicit config root,
   as shown above, by the plugin's SessionStart hook. It is an executable Bun
   CLI: run the path itself (it needs `bun` on PATH), never `bash write-state.sh`.
   Always pass the matching host override in the same command: plugin-root
   variables are lifecycle context and are not reliable in ordinary shell calls.

   It computes the gate's exact `diff_sha`/`base`/`slug`, sets `review_round`
   (1 for a new `diff_sha`, +1 only when rewriting at the same one — the gate
   caps at 5 rounds on an unchanged diff), and writes
   the active host's `<repo root>/.claude/tmp/push-review/` or
   `<repo root>/.codex/tmp/push-review/` path atomically as
   schema `version: 2`, including `reviewed_files` — auto-computed from
   `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` (sorted, unique); pass
   `--reviewed-files a.ts,b.rs` only if the review genuinely covered a
   different path set than the one auto-detected. The gate denies unless
   `reviewed_files` matches the diff's changed paths exactly. Harmless no-op
   when the toolu push-review gate is not installed (the file goes unread).

If findings remain that you cannot fix (e.g. needs a human decision), record them
with `--findings-count <n> --findings '<json>'` instead of 0 — the gate will then
keep blocking the push, which is correct: open findings are not done.
