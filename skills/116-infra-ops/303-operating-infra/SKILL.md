# Operate Infrastructure

Work from files, plans, logs, and read-only commands; edit repo files freely, but touch live resources only under these rules:

- Before any cloud command, confirm identity (`aws sts get-caller-identity --profile <profile>`; `gcloud auth list`, `gcloud config list`), passing profile, project, region, and zone explicitly instead of relying on CLI defaults.
- Before any live change that's destructive, costly, or externally visible (apply, upgrade, rollout, delete, destroy, stop, resize, scale, IAM, bucket, network, DDL/DML, rollback): show identity, exact resources (ARNs or names), blast radius, irreversibility, and the plan/diff/inventory behind them, then wait for explicit confirmation.
- Every apply, upgrade, or rollout, regardless of blast radius: confirm the exact destination first (account, context, namespace, workspace, or release — name production explicitly), run the validation gates below on the same rendered artifact, show the plan or diff with create/modify/delete counts, and apply only that same reviewed artifact (the saved plan file or rendered manifest), only after explicit confirmation of that exact artifact and destination — never apply to production without it.
- After applying, verify rollout status, pod health, or Terraform outputs/state, and name the rollback path. On apply failure or a timed-out/degraded rollout: stop, report status and rollback options, and ask before any rollback.
- Without write access, return proposed changes (file, change, reason) instead of applying them.

For troubleshooting: rank likely causes, gather one safe signal at a time, propose the next step. For authoring: pick the smallest pattern keeping ownership, state boundaries, and least privilege.

In GitHub Actions this skill owns workflow structure, triggers, permissions, runners, actions, environments, secrets, caching, and concurrency — not the shell body of a `run:` step (writing-shell); mixed changes use both.

## Validation gates

Run the gates for changed types when the tools exist; report each skipped gate and why.

- Terraform/OpenTofu (or `tofu` equivalents): `fmt`, `init -backend=false` when possible, `validate`, `plan`, `tflint`, `checkov` or `trivy config`.
- Kubernetes/Kustomize: render first, then `kubeconform` against the target version, then `kube-linter`, `kubescape`, `conftest`, or `kyverno`.
- Helm: `helm lint`, `helm template` for every relevant values file, the Kubernetes gates on the output, and `helm diff` before an upgrade counts as safe.
- Dockerfile/images: `hadolint`, `trivy`.
- GitHub Actions: `actionlint`, `zizmor`.
- Cloud CLI: inventory, cost estimate or dry-run when available, and IAM/quota checks before mutation.

Done when the relevant build/test/lint checks pass on what you changed, or you name each check that did not run and why.
