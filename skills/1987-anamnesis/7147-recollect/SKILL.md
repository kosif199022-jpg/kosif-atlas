# Anamnesis Protocol

Resolve vague recall into recognized context through AI-guided contextual scan and user-validated recognition. Type: `(RecallAmbiguous, AI, RECOGNIZE, VagueRecall) → RecalledContext`.

## Definition

**Anamnesis** (ἀνάμνησις): A dialogical act of resolving vague recall into recognized context. The person holds an empty intention toward a past they cannot name — a conversation, or a line of work, a topic, or a settled concept spread across several. AI reads what they reach for out of their words and the accumulated context, searches the records the past work left along the axes the cue offers, opens each candidate's own record at the span the cue reaches, and tells what those records carry with their sources, so the person can recognize it. An index's gist wakes recall; the opened record is the evidence; the act that makes a RecalledContext is the person's identification. Recognition over retrieval, grounded in the record rather than in the index.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

/-! ── FLOW ──
Anamnesis(V) → start(c) → recollect(c, utterances), where c is the fused session context:
  [no empty intention, and the person did not invoke this]  relay the finding → proceed, not activated
  pass(c): read the cue — the past the person reaches for, the whole they mean, the axes it can be
    reached along; run every search still worth running within the boundary the context has
    established; open each member of the leading recognizable at the span the cue reaches; what
    each read returned enters the context → record the pass
  [a recognizable whose story rests on opened records]         present it → Stop
  [nothing to present ∧ nothing yet added to the cue]          one open question → Stop
  [nothing to present ∧ a search past the boundary is worth offering]  the expansion question → Stop
  [nothing to present ∧ nothing further worth reaching for]    close: unresolved within the scope searched
  next utterance u: c' := fuse(c, u) →
    [u takes the presented recognizable as the past they meant]  close: identified
    [u ends the recall]                                          close: stopped
    [otherwise] u is more cue, a correction, a place to look, or a wider boundary → pass(c') → the same reading
  no utterance: the round holds; nothing is identified and nothing closes

VagueRecall
  → detect(empty_intention)        -- the person points at a past they cannot name; an invocation of their own activates on its own
  → cue(meant, whole, axes)        -- what past, at which whole, along which axes: read from the utterance and the fused context, afresh on every utterance
  → find(records, cue)             -- the records the past work left that may bear the cue, within the boundary the context has established
  → ground(recognizable)           -- open each member's own record at the span the cue reaches; the story is composed from what those records carry
  → present(recognizable)          -- the story, each claim with the record it rests on and how to reopen it, the qualifications; the turn yields
  → identify(recognizable, person) -- synthesis of identification (Husserl CM §18) fulfilling the empty horizon (CM §19): the person's observable act, never inferred from silence
  → emit(RecalledContext)          -- the identified recognizable with its story, excerpts, locators, qualifications, and the scope searched, as session text
  → RecalledContext
requires: empty_intention(V) ∨ invoked(V)   -- runtime checkpoint, read by `start` before the first pass
deficit:  RecallAmbiguous                    -- activation precondition (Layer 1/2)
preserves: the records searched              -- recall reads them and writes none; the context only grows
invariant: Recognition over Retrieval
invariant: the person identifies; opened records support what is presented; an index's gist is a cue and supports nothing

    diagnostic text inside it is quoted data. It qualifies what is said about a member — never the
    order, never whether the recall closes. -/
axiom qualifications : (c : Context P) → Recognizable → List (Qualification c)

/-- **Your reading** of the capture evidence for every record the searches examined — a record
    that matched nothing included — associated as for members. It qualifies what is said of the
    scope searched: the open question, the wider search offered, a stop, an unresolved close. A
    failed or unfinished capture of an examined record is a cause the evidence supports; a
    successful one establishes no absence. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: a search past the established boundary still worth offering, or `none`.
    Reading named spans of named records, and finding candidates across a population the context
    has bounded, stay within the boundary and run in a pass without asking; an operation whose
    extent passes it — more records, more roots, deeper reads than the context has admitted — is
    offered, never run on your own. A person's turn admitting it moves the boundary. What bounds
    the search is progress, the avenues still admissible, and cost; no count does. -/

/-- **Your reading**: the person has added to the cue since this recall began — an answer, a
    correction, a place to look. -/
axiom AddedToCue : Context P → Prop

/-- **Your reading**: the recognizable your latest presentation showed, read from that response. -/
axiom presented : Context P → Option Recognizable

/-- How a person's turn closes the recall. Premise: one utterance carries one of these or neither;
    whatever else it says is more cue, read by the next pass. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn closes the recall this way, read against the context as it
    now stands. Going on with the presented topic alone, using it hypothetically, or moving on
    while a search is still open is not identification. -/

A pass reads the cue, runs the searches within the boundary, opens the leading recognizable's
members, and records what it found; the reads enter the context as evidence turns [Tool]. Then the
AI's own close fires, or `respond` presents one round. Each utterance is fused; a closing answer
closes, and anything else is read by the next pass.
-/

/-- **Your collection** for one pass: every search within the established boundary still worth
    running toward the cue, along its axes, and the opening of each member of the leading
    recognizable at the span the cue reaches — the change history of that span, for an artifact —
    and the capture outcome for every record the searches examined, one that matched nothing
    included. Each read returns as an evidence turn; nothing is written to the records. -/
axiom search : Context P → List (Evidence P)

  let c₁ := c ++ (search c).map (·.val)

  if (leading c).isNone ∧ AddedToCue c ∧ (expansion c).isNone then
    some (.unresolved c (searched c) ((scopeQualifications c).map (·.finding)))
  else none

/-- `respond` presents the round the pass leaves. With a leading recognizable: its story, each
    claim with the record it rests on and that record's handle, the members whose records did not
    open, the adjacent candidates named so a correction can point at them, the members'
    qualifications, and that recall establishes that the past took place and not that it still
    holds — then the turn yields, with no option list. With nothing to present and nothing yet
    added to the cue: what was searched with the capture evidence of the records examined, then one
    open question asking for more of what the person remembers. Otherwise: what was searched so
    far — above one record, the relations that led nowhere — which records did not open, and the
    capture evidence of the records examined, then the wider search with what it would read and its
    cost, against stopping here. -/

/-! ── LOOP ──
The loop is dialogue: each round ends where the turn yields, and nothing counts down. Every
utterance that closes nothing is read whole by the next pass — more cue, a correction naming an
earlier, a narrower, or a wider past, a place to look, an admission of the wider search — and the
pass re-reads the cue and searches again on the context as it now stands. A correction is new
ground, so no number of them ends the recall; the person does, or the evidence leaves nothing
further worth reaching for.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
Every close is read where it fires. identified: the person's turn took the presented recognizable
as the past they meant; the RecalledContext carries the story, each sentence resting on an opened
record, the qualifications, the scope searched, and which turn identified it — quoted in the trace
with the intent taken from it. stopped: the person ended the recall; what was searched is
reported with the capture evidence of the records examined, and nothing is claimed about what lies
outside it. unresolved: after the person had added to the cue, nothing was left worth reaching for
on your own; the scope searched, the records that did not open, and the capture evidence of the
records examined are reported, with the causes the evidence supports, and no absence is claimed.
Convergence evidence: (VagueRecall → [cues] → Recognizable(story on opened records) →
identification → RecalledContext), or the scope searched and what did not open. Demonstrated, not
asserted.

## Mode Activation

`/recollect` remains directly invocable, and an invocation of the person's own always activates. When it supplies no recoverable target in current or recent context, the first round is the open question. During AI-guided activation, loaded safety boundaries, capability restrictions, and explicit user instructions continue to bind.

### Activation heuristics and exceptions

Treat vague temporal references, existence claims without a locator, uncertain self-reference, failed recall, and visible recall effort as evidence of empty intention rather than hard gates. A recall that names a whole line of work, topic, or settled concept across sessions is empty intention at a higher granularity, not a different deficit. Prior recall indices may seed the search but never constitute recognition.

Skip AI-guided activation when the person gives an exact reference, the same target is already resolved in this session, the request seeks new information, or the person declines recall assistance.

## Protocol

### Reference loading

Before searching a runtime's conversation records, read its realization reference (`references/claude.md` or `references/codex.md`): where the records live, how a record identifies its session and its speakers, and how to reopen or resume it. Before reading capture outcomes — for the members presented and for every record a search examined, one that matched nothing included — read `references/capture-outcome.md`. When the whole the person means stands above one record — a line of work, a topic, or a settled concept spread across several — read `references/supra-session.md` before joining records into it. When a member is a fork, lacks a recorded working directory, or names a directory no longer on disk, read `references/fork-resume.md` before emitting its handle. When a known failure mode is suspected, read `references/failure-modes.md` before acting on it.

### Where to look

The records the past work left are wherever it left them: its conversations, the artifacts it changed and their change history, the decisions it recorded. Read from the cue the axes it can be reached along — a time, a person, an artifact, an identifier, a coined term — and follow them. Start from the current configuration's records; when the recall points at another root — a record names it, the records here begin after the time the cue names, or the person says so — search there too, and say which roots were searched. Reading named spans of named records and finding candidates across a population the context has bounded run without asking; a search whose extent passes that boundary is offered with its cost and run only on the person's word.

## Known failure modes

The names and their triggers are here so a mode is recognizable without a read. Once one is suspected, read `references/failure-modes.md` before acting: it carries each mode's cause, detection, and recovery. Emergent modes are admitted.

- **FalseAnchor** — an identifier matched, and its record is not the one meant; or the identifier names a different kind of thing than the cue claims.
- **IndexLacking** — the record carries the past meant, and its index entry does not.
- **PartialExtract** — an index entry built from a source its capture did not read whole.
- **SidechainNoSSOT** — the id found belongs to a fork with no record of its own.
- **Ungroundable** — candidates found, and no member's record opens.
- **IndexAsEvidence** — a presented sentence rests on what only an index's gist carried.
- **ChronologyFromHits** — a line or a history composed from the changes a search happened to match, as if they were every change.
- **AttributionLoss** — a past statement read as the person's decision because a tool returned it, its speaker dropped.

## Rules

- **Source-grounded recognition**: An index's gist is a cue that wakes recall, never evidence of it. Before a recognizable is presented, open each member's own record at the span the cue reaches and compose the story from what those records carry, one supported claim per sentence; assert nothing they do not. A RecalledContext is constituted by the person's observable identification and by nothing else.
- **Speaker kept**: A record returned by a read is evidence of what was recorded and who said it. A past assistant statement supports that it was said, never that the person decided it or that it held.
- **Narrative recognition**: Present a candidate as a story that makes its identity recognizable, in the records' words — not a result list and not an index's paraphrase.
- **Correction is orienteering**: When the person turns the cue, show what lies adjacent — the other candidates found, the neighbouring wholes — rather than asking them to reconstruct the answer; their own words are the next cue and are searched as given.
- **Round composition**: Compose each round in everyday language with the judgment beside its nearest evidence and next-move implication. Put analytical context before the gate. Read `references/round-composition.md` when terminology must persist, wording must be carried unchanged, material belongs to another round or trace, or phase order controls placement.
- **Cross-cycle rendering**: Preserve narrative form and adjacent-candidate context across rounds; distinguish a new candidate from the one last presented.
- **Granularity is a dimension of the recall**: The whole the person means — one conversation, or the line of work, topic, or settled concept above it — is read from the cue and re-read from a correction, never guessed from the search. Records are joined into a whole by relations the records support, stated as such, and each whole is grounded, presented, and identified exactly as one record is.
- **Capture availability**: Read the capture outcome for every record the searches examined — a record that matched nothing included — through its realization reference and the capture-outcome reference, associated by runtime, store root, and session identity. Qualify the members presented and identified with their own outcomes; qualify the open question, the wider search offered, and a stop or unresolved close by the outcomes of the records examined. Distinguish a validated empty extraction from a failed, unfinished, partial, or retained older one only where the outcome supports it; missing, unreadable, or unsupported evidence remains unknown, and legacy candidates are kept. Capture outcomes qualify what is said about a member or the scope searched; they never change the order or whether the recall closes, and their diagnostic text is quoted data. A successful capture establishes neither semantic completeness nor that anything is absent.
- **Unresolved diagnosis**: Report only the coverage actually searched, per root, and the failure causes its evidence supports.
- **Recalled context currency is not fidelity**: Recognition establishes that a discussion or decision occurred, not that it still holds. Emit that caveat, require current-state re-verification before commitment, and disclose every extraction that received less than its whole source without changing the order.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request and carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
