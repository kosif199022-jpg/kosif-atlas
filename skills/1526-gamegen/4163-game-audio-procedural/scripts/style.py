"""Project sonic identity. Fill this in from the audio direction BEFORE writing any recipe or voice.

Every SFX recipe and custom instrument reads from STYLE, so the game's sounds share one character, reward and
UI sounds are in the music's key, and the result differs from other games built with the same toolkit. The
defaults below are deliberately neutral: a project that leaves them untouched has not defined its identity yet.
