# Manager

Manager mode has **two independent layers**. Keep them straight:

| Layer | What | Scope | Persistent |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| **SOFT codewords** (`++m` / `++rr` / `++r` / `++a`) | A `UserPromptSubmit` hook auto-injects a delegate-everything Manager prompt for ONE turn when it sees a codeword (`++m` is plan-aware — adds the plan supplement when `permission_mode === 'plan'`). **Always fires — this skill does NOT enable/disable it.** The skill only customizes the TEXT (`edit`/`purge`) and explains it (`status`). | Global or project (prompt text) | Yes (hook is always on) |
| **HARD wall** | An opt-in `PreToolUse` guard physically DENIES mutating tools (Write/Edit/Bash/…) in the **main session**, leaving only delegate/read/track. Subagents stay fully free. **Project-only, defaults OFF, installed into the project by this skill.** No codeword for the wall. | Project only | Yes, until `disable`/`uninstall` |

The two layers are orthogonal: codewords shape the Manager mindset; the wall enforces delegation by removing the tools that let the agent act as an executor. Either can be used alone.

## Codewords (SOFT — always active)

Alphabetic codewords are case-insensitive standalone tokens. Manager, architecture, and review are independent groups; `++rr` wins over `++r`. A standalone `+++` adds cron planning only when the hook payload confirms Plan mode (`permission_mode === 'plan'`), independently of `++m`. Context order when combined is cron planning, manager, architecture, then the selected review block. Your original prompt, including codewords, is preserved.

| Type anywhere in your prompt | Means | Injects | When |
|------------------------------|-------|---------|------|
| `++m` | Manager — delegate-everything for the current task; PLAN-AWARE (auto-adds the plan supplement in plan mode) | Manager (full) block, or full + plan addon when `permission_mode === 'plan'` | Always — hook-driven, independent of this skill |
| `++rr` | Regression Review — after each significant phase: no regression + project standard + correctness; two-phase review→double-check→fix; final cross-review at task end | Regression Review discipline (`review-regression`) block | Always — tested before `++r`; codeword-only |
| `++r` | Review — two-phase multi-agent review→double-check→fix after each significant change | Review discipline (`review-double`) block | Always — codeword-only (no ambient/wall injection) |
| `++a` | Architecture — architecture-first directive before implementation: fits existing project architecture/patterns/rules, robust + scalable + SIMPLE (no over-engineering), find the closest well-built counterpart in the repo and take its principles (additive to conventions/rules/docs, not a replacement), clean seams | `[DIRECTIVE: ARCHITECTURE-FIRST]` block | Independent group; combines with `++m`/`++rr`/`++r`; mode-agnostic — same block in normal and plan mode (written into the plan in plan mode) |
| `+++` | Plan task-specific session anti-drift scheduling for execution | `cron-plan` block | Only verified Plan mode; requires neither `++m` nor the hard wall |

The block applies to that one turn only. When the HARD wall is armed, the Manager (full) block is also ambient-injected every turn — no codeword needed. Codewords and wall injection are independent. Review codewords (`++rr`/`++r`) are never ambient-injected.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/brewtools:manager-setup` | No argument = `status`. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup status` | Print wall state, prompt sources, codeword behavior, and resolved prompt blocks |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup install` | Install the HARD wall guard into this project. Asks to confirm before arming (`AskUserQuestion`) unless your prompt already said so explicitly (e.g. "enable the hard wall") — plain `install` or autonomy phrasing never counts; declining still installs and leaves `state.hard=false`. `/reload` only on FIRST install. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup upgrade` | Re-copy the guard from the current plugin version and re-register if missing. `hard`/`level` preserved; aborts if not installed. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup enable` | Arm an already-installed wall (state flip only) — same confirm gate as `install`; declining aborts with nothing changed. Not installed → routes you to `install`. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup disable` | Disarm the HARD wall (state flip only; registration stays in `settings.local.json`). Guard no-ops until re-armed. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup uninstall` | Deregister the wall from `settings.local.json` + delete the copied guard. Auto-disarms first. State and prompt overrides KEPT. Run `/reload` after. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup purge [--scope global\|project]` | `uninstall` + delete `state.json` and the prompt override(s). The only destructive action. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup level <strict\|balanced>` | Set wall strictness (project only). `balanced` = read-only Bash allowed; `strict` = all Bash denied. |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup edit [full] [--scope ...]` | Copy default block to an override and show the path for editing |
| `/brewtools:manager-setup <any task>` | Inline Manager run — prepends the full block and delegates the task |

The wall verbs are project-only — `--scope` applies to `edit`/`purge` (the prompt-text override files) and is ignored elsewhere. `on`, `off`, `reset`, `setup` and `remove` are no longer commands. Only `on` / `off` / `reset` survive, as free-text synonyms routed to `enable` / `disable` / `purge`; `setup` and `remove` route nowhere.

## NL prompts (RU+EN)

| Phrase | Resolves to |
|--------|-------------|
| `установи стену`, `install manager`, `поставь стену` | `install` |
| `обнови гард`, `update the guard`, `перекопируй хук` | `upgrade` |
| `включи менеджера`, `enable manager`, `manager on`, `вкл стену`, `arm wall` | `enable` |
| `выключи менеджера`, `turn off manager`, `manager off`, `выкл стену`, `стену выключи`, `disarm wall` | `disable` |
| `снеси стену`, `удали хук`, `деинсталлируй`, `remove hook`, `uninstall` | `uninstall` |
| `вычисти`, `снеси всё`, `сброс`, `верни дефолт`, `reset` | `purge` |
| `уровень строгий`, `level strict`, `режим строгий`, `strict mode` | `level strict` |
| `уровень сбалансированный`, `level balanced`, `режим сбалансированный` | `level balanced` |
| `статус`, `что сейчас`, `manager status`, no argument | `status` |
| `поправь промт`, `edit prompt`, `customize` | `edit` |

Ambiguous or conflicting input triggers `AskUserQuestion`.

## Scopes & resolution

| Scope | State file | Prompt overrides |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Project (default) | `.claude/brewtools/manager/state.json` | `.claude/brewtools/manager/prompts/<mode>.md` |
| Global | `~/.claude/manager/state.json` | `~/.claude/manager/prompts/<mode>.md` |

Resolution order (first hit wins):
- **State** `{enabled, mode}`: project → global → default `{enabled:true, mode:"full"}`
- **Wall flags** `{hard, level}`: **project only** — global state never enables the wall
- **Prompt** `<mode>`: project → global → plugin default (`skills/manager-setup/references/<mode>.md`)

Global paths (`~/.claude/manager/*`) are protected for the Write/Edit tools, so the skill writes them through bundled Node helpers via Bash. Project paths are plain writes.

## Hard wall

The HARD wall is an **installed-into-the-project** `PreToolUse` guard, NOT a plugin hook.

**Install-once + state-gate** is the design crux:

| Thing | Where | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| Guard source | `$BT_ROOT/hooks/hardmode-guard.mjs` | Shipped with plugin; project copy updated on every `install`/`upgrade` |
| Copied guard | `<cwd>/.claude/brewtools/manager/hardmode-guard.mjs` | The actual file that runs |
| Copied off-switch CLI | `<cwd>/.claude/brewtools/manager/manager-state.mjs` | Fixed path so the disarm command needs no `$BT_ROOT` resolution (resolution needs shell operators the wall denies) |
| Registration | `<cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` — `PreToolUse "*"` entry | Personal, gitignored. Persistent plumbing; harmless inert when wall is off. |
| Runtime kill-switch | `<cwd>/.claude/brewtools/manager/state.json` `{hard}` | `enable`/`disable` flip this only — never touch `settings.local.json` |

`install` = copy guard + off-switch CLI + register (idempotent), then arm ONLY on explicit confirmation (`AskUserQuestion` "Yes, arm it now", or explicit wording already in the prompt) — declining still installs but leaves `hard=false`. `/reload` only on first install.
`upgrade` = re-copy both files + re-register if missing + restamp `state.json`'s `version`/`generated_by`/`last_updated` (empty-partial `writeState`, so `hard`/`level` survive verbatim — that is what clears the `stale` verdict `setup-status` reads off the same key). Aborts when not installed. Also backfills the off-switch CLI into projects installed before it existed.
`enable` / `disable` = flip `state.hard` only. `enable` is gated by the same confirm step as `install` — declining aborts, nothing changes. Guard stays registered; while disabled it no-ops.
`uninstall` = TWO Bash calls: the bare exempt disarm, then deregister + delete copies. Then `/reload`.
`purge` = `uninstall` + delete `.claude/brewtools/manager/` (state + prompt overrides).

### Tool buckets (while wall is ON)

| Bucket | Tools | Main session |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| ALWAYS-ALLOW | read: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `NotebookRead` · delegate: `Task`, `Agent`, `Skill`, `SlashCommand`, `ListAgents`, `SendMessage`, `Monitor` · plan: `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode` · discovery: `ToolSearch` · track: `TaskCreate/Update/List/Get`, `TodoWrite`, `ReportFindings` · timers: `CronCreate`, `CronList`, `CronDelete` · shells: `BashOutput`, `KillShell`, `KillBash` · MCP meta: `ListMcpResourcesTool`, `ReadMcpResourceTool` · `AskUserQuestion` | Allowed by this wall; each tool's permissions and active mode still apply |
| ALWAYS-BLOCK | `Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit`, `WebFetch`, `Artifact` (default-deny — it publishes), MCP-write tools | Denied |
| LEVEL-gated | `Bash`, `WebSearch`, MCP-read tools | Decided by `level` |

The `agent_id` linchpin: subagent tool calls carry `agent_id` → guard allows. Main session calls have no `agent_id` → guard applies the wall. Subagents are always fully free.

### strict vs balanced

| Aspect | `strict` | `balanced` (default) |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| `Bash` | All Bash denied — even `git status` must go to a subagent | Read-only inspection allowed (`git status/log/diff`, `ls`, `cat`, `gh ... list/view`, etc.) |
| `WebSearch` | OFF | ON |
| MCP-read | Explicit-allow list only | Heuristic allow (read-shaped tool names) |
| MCP-write | Denied | Denied |

### Off-switch safety

Exactly ONE Bash shape survives an armed wall, at every level:

```
node <ABS project root>/.claude/brewtools/manager/manager-state.mjs set hard=false
```

`/brewtools:manager-setup disable` runs precisely that (`Skill` is in ALWAYS-ALLOW, so the skill can always start). The exemption is narrow on purpose: the command must start with `node `, carry no shell operator outside quotes, no `$` expansion, no evaluator flag (`-e`/`--eval`/`-p`/`--print`/`--input-type`/`--require`/`--import`/`--loader`), and **the script node actually executes must be the helper itself** — a `manager-state.mjs` substring elsewhere on the line counts for nothing. Appending `&& echo "✅"` or a `BT_ROOT=...` prelude makes the guard deny it.

> Before v5.0.0 the exemption matched that substring anywhere, so `node -e "<payload>" manager-state.mjs` executed arbitrary code at `level strict`. Do not relax it back to tolerate `&&`.

Universal fallback: delegate to a subagent — `Task`/`Agent` are always allowed and subagents bypass the wall. Every deny message from the guard includes the exit command verbatim.

> **If you installed the wall before v5.0.0, run `/brewtools:manager-setup upgrade` once.** The disarm command above runs a project-local `manager-state.mjs`, and only `install`/`upgrade` copy it there. An older project has no such file, so the command fails with `Cannot find module` and the wall has no documented off-switch. `upgrade` backfills it and leaves `hard`/`level` untouched.
>
> If the wall is already armed when you discover this, do not try to resolve `$BT_ROOT` in the main session — that needs shell operators the wall denies. Delegate one subagent (`Task` is always allowed, subagents bypass the wall) to run `upgrade`, then re-issue the bare disarm command.

## Modes (prompt text)

| Mode | Selected by | Block |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `full` | `++m` (not in plan mode) | Manager role + protocol: decompose → TaskGraph → delegate → observe → integrate. Hands off everything. |
| `planmode` | `++m` when `permission_mode === 'plan'` (auto — no separate codeword) | Full block + Plan Mode addon: the plan itself must encode the whole TaskGraph in English, pre-decomposed with owners, dependencies, and parallel markers. |
| `cron-plan` | Standalone `+++` when `permission_mode === 'plan'` | Read-only anti-drift timer planning; scheduling deferred to execution |
| `architect` | `++a` | Architecture-first design using project patterns |
| `review-double` | `++r`, without `++rr` | Two-phase review discipline |
| `review-regression` | `++rr` | Regression-focused review discipline |

## Plan-only session anti-drift

While already in Plan mode, type:

```text
+++ plan the API migration and task tracking
```

This includes a future execution step through task-board: one unique session timer per active
top-level task, hourly by default or at your requested cadence. Prepare the task's methodology,
base work units, complete unique prompt, timezone, schedule id, delivered tick count, and stop
rule. Child work units share their parent's timer. Planning writes no task files and creates or
deletes no timers.

Each delivered tick rereads goal, methodology, anti-drift controls, and user corrections;
collects available active-agent evidence; reconciles statuses, dependencies, and remaining
work; and refreshes the task graph. Retain all unfinished nodes and the latest ten completed
nodes, preserving older completion evidence outside the active graph. Check drift against
acceptance criteria, correct deviations within scope, and advance authorized unblocked work.

Report at most five short lines: local time/timezone, tick number and elapsed time; 🟢 results;
🔵 remaining work and next action; 🔴 present problems/blockers/questions; ⚪ drift verdict.
Omit empty rows and keep full evidence in task records.

The main session's task-board flow owns scheduling and verifies stopping on completion or
cancellation. Missing scheduling tools are reported as a gap; stored intent is not a live
timer. Timers are session-scoped, and scheduled time does not guarantee exact receipt or
delivery after session closure. Outside verified Plan mode, `+++` adds no cron context.

CronCreate, CronList, and CronDelete pass the hard wall so task-board can own live timer
lifecycle during execution. This allowlist does not override read-only Plan mode: preparation
stays in the plan, and timer creation/deletion waits for authorized execution.

These are Claude Code product hooks and scheduling contracts. Codex uses its own native
instructions and available tools; these files do not configure Codex runtime state.

## Customizing the prompt

```
/brewtools:manager-setup edit full     # copy default into project override, then edit it
/brewtools:manager-setup purge         # drop the override AND the wall, back to plugin default
```

`edit` creates the override (seeded with the current effective text) if absent, then shows the path. The injected text is everything inside the fenced ``` or ~~~ blocks if present, else the whole file.

## Examples

```
# Codewords (always work, no setup needed)
++m implement the new caching layer
# In plan mode (permission_mode === 'plan'), ++m auto-adds the plan supplement:
++m design the migration from v1 to v2 schema
# Architecture-first, combine with Manager delegation:
++m ++a implement the new caching layer

# Hard wall — install for this project (arming requires confirmation)
/brewtools:manager-setup install
# → copies guard, registers in settings.local.json
# → asks "Arm the HARD wall now?" unless your prompt already said so explicitly; Yes arms state.hard=true, No leaves it disarmed
# → if newly registered: "run /reload to activate"

# Tighten to strict (no Bash at all in main session)
/brewtools:manager-setup level strict

# Check current state (also what a bare invocation does)
/brewtools:manager-setup status

# Disarm wall (leave registration in place)
/brewtools:manager-setup disable

# Re-arm it later
/brewtools:manager-setup enable

# After a plugin update, refresh the project copy of the guard
/brewtools:manager-setup upgrade

# Remove wall from this project (state + prompt overrides kept)
/brewtools:manager-setup uninstall
# → deregisters from settings.local.json, run /reload after

# Remove absolutely everything this skill wrote
/brewtools:manager-setup purge

# Prompt-text customization (independent of the wall)
/brewtools:manager-setup edit full

# NL equivalents
включи менеджера глобально
стену выключи
уровень строгий
удали хук

# Inline Manager run (no wall change)
/brewtools:manager-setup refactor the auth module
```
