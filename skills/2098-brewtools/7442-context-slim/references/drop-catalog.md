# Drop Catalog -- instructions the model already follows by default

Decision basis for `brewtools:context-slim`. A row here is a **candidate** for deletion, never an
automatic delete: verify actual loading and behavioral delta for the target model/configuration. Companion:
`keep-catalog.md` (invariants that must survive byte-exact). Extends `text-optimize` rule **A.4**
(Common-Knowledge Elision) -- same ledger, same "unsure -> keep" tiebreak.

## STRUCTURAL EXEMPTION -- absolute, precedes every row below

**No row in this catalog may drop text that lives inside a fenced code block or inside markdown
table structure.** This is not a tiebreak, it is a filter applied BEFORE any matcher runs
(Decision rule step 0). Two protected regions:

| Region | Definition | Why |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Fenced code | every line from an opening ` ``` `/`~~~` fence through its closing fence, fences included | A fenced block is an EXAMPLE or a COMMAND. Its prose is quoted, not instructed. Verified defect: row 23 (`you are (an?\|the) (expert\|senior\|...)`) matches `brewcode/agents/agent-creator.md:205`, the string `"prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer..."` inside a fenced JSON example -- dropping it breaks the example the agent is told to copy |
| Table structure | any line whose first non-space char is `\|`: header row, `\| --- \|` delimiter row, and every body row -- plus the row's cell count | A header row (`\| Event \| Matcher \| When \| Note \|`) carries no invariant of its own, so an unguarded catalog hit destroys a 4-column table. Cell CONTENT stays evaluable, but a row never loses a cell and a table never loses a row |

`dedup-arbitration.md:69` already strips fences in the dedup prefilter; this catalog needs the same
guard and did not have one. Dedup and drop must agree on what is quoted text.

## Reading the matchers

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Dialect | ERE, run with `grep -oiE` or `rg -oiN --engine default` (case-insensitive assumed) |
| Table escaping | `\|` inside a matcher is markdown escaping -- **unescape to `\|` -> `|` before running** |
| Exemption first | Run every matcher over the file with fenced blocks and `\|`-leading lines REMOVED. A hit inside either region does not exist |
| Hit != delete | A hit opens a judgement, resolved by the twin table + Decision rule below |
| `JUDGE-ONLY` | A row so marked never auto-drops at any depth. It only routes the span to the phase 3 LLM judge, whose verdict then re-enters the Decision rule at step 2 |
| Example column | `path:line` = real occurrence in this repo. `(synthetic)` = written here; no repo instance exists because the repo is already compressed |
| Src column | Legend below; every row is grounded, no bare assertions |

## Inverted near-twins -- these LOOK droppable and are KEEPS

Model advice applies only to its named model/configuration; generic verification candidates
never override mandatory tests/gates/independent review. Examples are historical evidence.

An instruction earns its tokens when it **inverts or tightens** a documented default, names a
threshold, or names a project fact. Same surface words, opposite verdict.

| # | DROP form (no delta) | KEEP form (inverts / tightens / names) | What the keep-form changes |
|---|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | "write clean, readable code" | "Comments only where they earn it: non-obvious logic + public API docstrings; !=narrate self-evident code" | Inverts the model's default to comment liberally |
| 2 | "be concise" | "Verdict first, <=30 lines, `path:line`, !=preamble" | PBP: latest models are "less verbose" but still need explicit preamble suppression; adds a number |
| 3 | "think step by step" | "Report verdict, evidence and next action; <=30 lines" | Defines visible output; never suppresses internal reasoning |
| 4 | "handle errors appropriately" | "grep-filter pipelines under `set -o pipefail` need `\|\| true`" (`.claude/rules/avoid.md:7`) | Names the exact failure and the exact fix |
| 5 | "follow best practices" | "Pin exact semver X.Y.Z everywhere; `@latest`/`:latest`/`@main` forbidden" (`~/.claude/rules/avoid.md:4`) | A prohibition the model does not default to |
| 6 | "write tests" | "GIVEN/WHEN/THEN comments, descriptive names, no logs in tests" | Project test contract, not the generic habit |
| 7 | "be helpful / do the task well" | "Manager -- NEVER executor. Every real-work unit -> a subagent" | Inverts the default do-it-yourself behaviour |
| 8 | "if unsure, ask the user" | "At most ONE clarifying `AskUserQuestion`, max 4 questions, only when the answer changes what is written" | Caps a default that otherwise overtriggers (PBP) |
| 9 | "double-check your work" | "`++r`: 1. Review 2. Double-check 3. Fix only after confirmation -- never fix on the first pass" | Names a mechanism + an ordering; PBP says the bare form should be *removed* on Opus 5 |
| 10 | "use meaningful names" | "Spell **Maksim**: !=\"Maxim\", !=\"Maxim KS\"" | An identity fact no model can derive |
| 11 | "don't over-engineer" | "Opus 4.5/4.6 tend to overengineer -> state an explicit minimal-complexity constraint" | Model-scoped; PBP documents the tendency and prescribes the constraint |
| 12 | "validate inputs" | "!=ANY inequality (`>`,`>=`) in assertions -> exact equality; non-deterministic -> explicit tolerance" | Inverts the model's default weak-assertion habit |
| 13 | "ask before doing anything risky" | "!=revert without CONF: `git revert`, `git reset`, `git checkout -- <file>`, `git restore` require EXPLICIT confirmation" | Enumerates the exact commands |
| 14 | "keep the docs up to date" | "!=hand-edit MDX/README/`navigation.ts`; use `/docs`" (`.claude/rules/docs-workflow.md`) | A prohibition + a named replacement path |

## Decision rule

**Unit of decision = the CLAUSE, never the line.** A clause is: one table cell (split the row on `|`),
or one sentence/`;`-delimited segment/`--`- or em-dash-delimited segment of a prose line. An invariant
protects the clause that carries it, not the twelve other words parked on the same line.

Apply in order; the first hit decides. Anything unresolved is a KEEP.

| Step | Test | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | Is the span inside a fenced code block, or on a `\|`-leading table-structure line? | KEEP, untouched -- STRUCTURAL EXEMPTION, no matcher runs |
| 1 | Does the CLAUSE carry a **hard** `keep-catalog.md` invariant -- number/version, path/glob/filename, env key, backtick literal, URL, `!=`, ALL-CAPS modal, threshold/comparison, Cyrillic, or a lowercase negation (`never`, `do not`, `must not`, `avoid`, `unless`, `except`, `only`)? | KEEP that clause byte-exact; sibling clauses on the same line continue to step 2 |
| 2 | Does the clause invert or tighten a documented default (twins table)? | KEEP |
| 3 | Does it name a threshold, count, ratio or deadline? | KEEP |
| 4 | Would the model behave identically with the clause deleted? | DROP -> loss ledger `elided-known` |
| 5 | Genuinely uncertain, or the row is `JUDGE-ONLY` and the judge did not return a clear verdict | KEEP (A.4 tiebreak: "Unsure whether generic -> keep") |

### Gate classes are not drop vetoes

`keep-catalog.md`'s `crit_tokens_ext()` alphabet serves the mechanical VERIFY gate, which has **set**
semantics over the whole file: one surviving occurrence anywhere satisfies it. Two of its classes --
`slug:` (`[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)+`) and bare capitalised words -- are declared "high-frequency by
design" there precisely so bulk deletion fails the gate. Reading them as per-line KEEP vetoes is a
category error: it made step 1 fire on almost every line and left the catalog with nothing to act on.

Measured on this repo, step 1 keep rate, whole-line vs clause + hard classes only:

| File | BEFORE: whole line, all classes | AFTER: clause, hard classes | Eligible surface, bytes (BEFORE -> AFTER) |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | 177/205 lines = **86%** | 255/461 clauses = **55%** | 2% -> **14%** |
| `.claude/rules/avoid.md` | 11/15 = **73%** | 22/46 = **48%** | 2% -> **23%** |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | 67/71 = **94%** | 93/174 = **53%** | 2% -> **22%** |

Reproduce with the class lists above; the BEFORE column is what the pre-fix rule produced. `slug:` and
capitalised-word hits still count at VERIFY time, so nothing that was protected becomes deletable --
what changes is that a generic clause no longer rides to safety on a specific neighbour.

> A drop is a **whole-line** operation only when EVERY clause on the line is generic. A generic clause
> welded to a specific one (row 7: "production-quality bash scripts **for macOS/Linux**") loses the
> adjective, keeps the scope.

### Row 34 worked measurement (`JUDGE-ONLY` + qualified matcher)

Over `brewcode/agents/*.md`, the published unqualified matcher hit **13 lines**. Three were the named
false positives: `agent-creator.md:153` (the table header `| Event | Matcher | When | Note |`,
moved to `brewcode/skills/agents/references/agent-frontmatter-fields.md:89` after the agent-creator
rewrite), `agent-creator.md:456` (`| red | Security, critical |`, a lookup value, moved to
`brewcode/skills/agents/references/agent-template.md:130`), `bc-rules-organizer.md:151`
(`critical > important > nice-to-have`, an ordering). Applying step 0 plus clause (b) of the row-34
matcher leaves **3 lines**, and all three named false positives are gone. Those 3 are judge referrals,
not drops -- the row is `JUDGE-ONLY`.

`UNVERIFIED` labels: none of the rows above rest on an unsourced claim. Where a row's example is
`(synthetic)`, the *pattern* is still sourced by its Src key -- only the sample sentence is invented,
because this repo's context layer was already compressed past those forms.
