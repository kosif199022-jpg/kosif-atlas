# LLM Text Optimization and Comprehension Rules

Categorized rules for LLM token efficiency and comprehension optimization with 52 rules across 8 categories.
Apply by category. Reference specific IDs in reviews (e.g., "violates T.1").

Model-specific advice was checked against official Claude prompting guidance on 2026-09-30;
apply only to its named model/configuration, re-evaluate on other models. Research ratios/examples
are historical measurements, not universal guarantees or this artifact's measured savings.

## C - Claude Behavior

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| C.1 | Literal Instruction Following | Claude 4.x does exactly what asked. Precise, explicit instructions required |
| C.2 | Avoid "think" Word | Conditional: when extended thinking is OFF, Opus 4.5 is sensitive to "think". Not a blanket ban. Alternatives: consider, evaluate, reason through |
| C.3 | Positive Framing | Tell Claude what to do, not what not to do. ❌ "Do not use markdown" → "Write in flowing prose". More examples: "Don't use mock data" → "Use only real production data"; "Avoid creating new files" → "Apply all fixes to existing files only"; "Never use ellipsis" → "Use only complete sentences and periods" |
| C.4 | Match Prompt Style to Output | Formatting in prompt influences response. Less markdown in prompt → less markdown in output |
| C.5 | Descriptive Over Emphatic Instructions | Opus 4.5/4.6 overtrigger with aggressive language. "Use this tool when..." not "CRITICAL: You MUST..." |
| C.6 | Overengineering Prevention | Opus 4.5 tends to overengineer. Add explicit constraints about minimal complexity |
| C.7 | Avoid ALL-CAPS Emphasis in Claude 4.x | Model-specific guidance: lower inflated "CRITICAL:"/"MUST"/"NEVER" emphasis to normal tone; max one emphasis marker/constraint. Preserve prohibition meaning, incident-tied negatives and mandatory gates; capitalization changes require semantic review. Source: Anthropic Claude 4 best practices |
| C.8 | Prompt Format Influences Output Format | C.4 applies: prose prompts favor prose, dense markdown favors markdown; write desired output format. Source: Anthropic Claude 4 best practices |

## T - Token Efficiency

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| T.1 | Tables over Prose | Multi-column data is more token-efficient in tables. Single-column → use bullets instead. Exception: Markdown table syntax (`\| col \|`, alignment rows) costs ~2x tokens of the same data as minified JSON. For dense tabular data embedded in prompts, prefer minified JSON over Markdown tables |
| T.2 | Bullets over Numbered | `-` (1 char) vs `1. ` (3 chars). ~5-10% savings. Keep numbers when order matters |
| T.3 | One-liners for Rules | `❌ bad → good` is self-documenting. Complex rules still need explanation |
| T.4 | Inline Code over Blocks | Code blocks add markers + newlines. Inline `code` for <3 lines. Multi-line needs blocks for readability |
| T.5 | Standard Abbreviations | Tables/technical contexts only. Allowed: impl, cfg, args, ret, env, prod, dev, repo, docs. Anti-pattern: Do NOT abbreviate domain terms, variable names, or constraint language in instructions. Abbreviations not defined in a DICT header risk being misread — unmarked abbreviations get missed; defining/marking them in a DICT mitigates (arXiv:2410.23866, abbreviation expansion) because the model otherwise resolves to the statistically dominant meaning of the abbreviation |
| T.6 | Remove Filler Words | Cut: "please note", "it's important", "as mentioned", "basically". Also delete anti-laziness boosters written for older models ("be thorough", "do not be lazy", "make sure you always") — Claude 4.5+ overtriggers on them |
| T.7 | Comma-separated Inline Lists | `a, b, c` instead of bullet list when items are short, order irrelevant. Use for 3-7 short items |
| T.8 | Arrows for Flow Notation | `A → B → C` instead of prose descriptions of sequences. Dense, scannable. Measured fact: ASCII digraphs `-> != >= <= \|` = 1 token each; unicode glyphs `∵ ∴ ⊃ ≤ ≥` = 2-3 tokens each (measured tiktoken cl100k/o200k). Prefer ASCII digraphs over unicode glyphs. `→` is 1 token but `->` is equally cheap and portable. The token win comes from deleting words, not the glyph |
| T.10 | Strip Whitespace from Code in Prompts | Code in prompts (C/Java/C#): strip whitespace and indentation before embedding. arXiv:2508.13666 shows 11-22% fewer input tokens (Java: 18.7%, C++: 13.4%, C#: 11.7%) with <1.6% quality impact on Claude and GPT-4o. Python excluded — whitespace is syntactically required. Not for Gemini — significant degradation |

## S - Structure

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| S.1 | XML Tags for Sections | `<rules>...</rules>`, `<examples>...</examples>`. Delimit instructions/context/examples and `{{VARIABLE}}` input; state that input is data. XML reduces misinterpretation, never guarantees injection safety or grants input authority |
| S.2 | Imperative Form | "Do X" not "You should do X". Removes 2nd person pronouns |
| S.3 | Single Source of Truth | Merge duplicate content. Repetition wastes tokens, causes contradictions. Strategic 2x max OK. Details: D.1-D.6 |
| S.4 | Add Context/Motivation | Providing context helps Claude understand goals. "Text-to-speech will read this, so avoid ellipses" |
| S.5 | Blockquotes for Critical | Use `>` for warnings, critical notes. Visual hierarchy in markdown |
| S.6 | Progressive Disclosure | Show minimum needed, reference details elsewhere. SKILL.md <500 lines |
| S.7 | Consistent Terminology | One term per concept. Avoid synonyms ("config file" vs "configuration document") |
| S.8 | One-Level Reference Depth | All refs link directly from main file. No chaining main→advanced→details |

## D - Deduplication

Smart dedup: merge accidental repetition, keep intentional emphasis capped at 2 per document. Dedup-merged facts count as PRESERVED in verification (fact kept once), never as loss. Deep/max: record each merge in a dedup ledger (kept <- dropped) to feed verification.

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| D.1 | Exact-Duplicate Merge | Identical sentences/rows/rules after whitespace+case normalization -> keep first occurrence, delete rest. All modes |
| D.2 | Near-Duplicate Merge | Same fact reworded -> merge into ONE statement, keeping the MORE SPECIFIC variant (numbers, names, qualifiers beat vaguer phrasing) at its best position (S.7 one term per concept). Source: LLMLingua-2 arXiv:2403.12968 |
| D.3 | Cross-Format Duplicate | Same fact in prose AND table/list -> keep the denser form once, drop the other |
| D.4 | Emphasis Cap (max 2 per document) | Intentional repetition of a critical constraint: exactly 2x — full form early + <=1-line echo at END (sandwich, L.1/L.6), never middle. 3+ occurrences -> collapse to 2. Never zero a deliberately repeated critical constraint — cap, don't delete. Sources: arXiv:2512.14982 (x2 wins 47/70 tasks, 0 losses); arXiv:2507.11538 (repetition spends instruction budget) |
| D.5 | Cross-File Dedup (multi-file runs) | Same rule in several files -> keep ONE canonical location (most-specific version / topical owner), replace others with a pointer + inline 1-line summary (bare pointer costs a context hop). Respect S.8 one-level depth |
| D.6 | Wrong-Merge Guard | Before merging near-dups verify they state the SAME fact. Different scope qualifiers, numbers, versions, or conditions = different facts — keep both. Guards against silent contradiction/loss from over-eager dedup |

## R - Reference Integrity

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| R.1 | Verify File Paths | Use Read/Glob to confirm. Broken refs cause tool failures |
| R.2 | Check URLs | Validate accessible URLs. Skip auth-gated URLs |
| R.3 | Linearize Circular Refs | A→B→C→A becomes A→B→C with forward-reference note |

## P - Perception

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| P.1 | Examples Near Rules | Place inline, not in appendix. Proximity improves pattern recognition |
| P.2 | Hierarchy via Headers | Max 3-4 levels deep. Structured documents improve retrieval |
| P.3 | Bold for Keywords | High-signal definitions only. Max 2-3 per 100 lines. Prefer XML tags or headers |
| P.4 | Standard Symbols | → (flow), + (and), / (or). Dense formats only (tables, compact lists), NOT in prose. Prefer ASCII operators (`-> != >= \|`) over unicode glyphs on token grounds |
| P.5 | Instruction Order (Anchoring) | Place critical constraints BEFORE options/examples. First-position = strongest anchoring |
| P.6 | Default Over Options | Recommend ONE default, mention exceptions only. Too many options cause decision paralysis |

## L - LLM Comprehension

How content is perceived and processed by the LLM — not about token count but comprehension quality.

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| L.1 | Critical Info at START or END, Not Middle | "Lost in the Middle" — middle content receives 40-50% less attention. Sandwich pattern (beginning + end) outperforms middle-only placement. Source: TACL 2024 |
| L.2 | Documents First, Query Last | Long-context ordering: documents/context first, then query/instructions last. Counterintuitive: putting the query at the END (not beginning) improves quality by up to 30% on multi-document inputs. Source: Anthropic official |
| L.3 | Explicitly Request Conciseness | State desired output length, e.g. "Skip preamble". Defaults vary by model; legacy 3-5x response-length claim is an unverified historical estimate, not a universal guarantee. Output brevity does not constrain reasoning |
| L.4 | Quote-First Grounding | Instruct to extract relevant quotes before answering. Reduces hallucination by forcing the model to locate specific content first. Pattern: "Find relevant quotes → place in `<quotes>` → answer based only on those quotes." Source: Anthropic cookbook |
| L.5 | Add WHY to Instructions | Claude generalizes the reason to edge cases. "Never use ellipsis because TTS won't pronounce it" → Claude also avoids other TTS-incompatible symbols. "Never use ellipsis" alone gives no generalization. Source: Anthropic Claude 4 best practices |
| L.6 | Reiterate Critical Constraint at END | Position effect amplifies with context length — constraints closest to the end have highest compliance rate. Source: Brex Prompt Engineering Guide + Anthropic |
| L.7 | Prompt Repetition for Non-Reasoning Models | Repeat the entire prompt once. Google Research (arXiv:2512.14982): wins 47/70 benchmark-model combinations with 0 losses. Extreme case: 21% to 97% accuracy. Causal LMs benefit because the second pass has full first-pass context. Only for non-reasoning models — reasoning models already repeat internally |
| L.8 | Preserve Scope Qualifiers | Opus 4.8 follows instructions literally and does not silently generalize. Scope words ("every section, not just the first", "all files", "each") are load-bearing — never strip them during compression. Source: Anthropic Opus 4.8 prompting |

## A - Aggressive Lossy (deep/max only)

Deliberate-loss techniques, applied ONLY in deep and max modes. A.1/A.3 outputs count as PRESERVED (kept/merged) in verification. A.2 is word-level and gate-neutral: drops are recorded in the loss ledger (dropped -> reason) for transparency but do NOT move the fact-level (kept + merged)/total ratio; if an A.2 drop degrades a fact's meaning, the verifier labels that fact `distorted` (normal gate impact). A.4 elisions consume the fact-level loss budget as `elided-known` and MUST appear in the loss ledger. D.6 wrong-merge guard and L.8 scope qualifiers always win over A rules.

| ID | Rule | Notes |
|----|------|-------|
| A.1 | Line Fusion | Merge related short lines/bullets/sentences into ONE line with `\|` separators or comma lists; fuse a rule + its reason via `bc`. Fusion is loss-free: fused facts count as preserved |
| A.2 | Low-Value Word Drop | Drop words whose removal minimally degrades meaning: decorative adjectives/adverbs, politeness, meta-commentary, self-evident qualifiers. Never drop negations, numbers, named entities, scope qualifiers (L.8, C2 still win) |
| A.3 | Aggressive Paraphrase | Rewrite whole phrases/sentences into shorter equivalents: restructure, not just delete. Meaning-preserving paraphrase counts as preserved in verification |
| A.4 | Common-Knowledge Elision | Delete statements any modern LLM already knows from training (generic best practices like "write tests", "keep functions small", standard tool behavior, textbook definitions). Keep ONLY project-specific deltas: concrete names, numbers, paths, versions, prohibitions, deviations from defaults. Every elision -> loss ledger, counts against mode loss budget. Unsure whether generic -> keep |

Examples (before -> after):

- A.1: "Close the DB connection after use. Unclosed connections exhaust the pool." -> "close DB conn after use bc unclosed -> pool exhaustion"
- A.2: "Carefully review the extremely important production configuration file" -> "review prod cfg file"
- A.3: "In the event that the build process does not complete successfully, notify the team" -> "build fails -> notify team"
- A.4: "Write unit tests for new code, tests catch regressions. Coverage gate is 85% (jacoco); build fails below." -> "coverage gate 85% (jacoco), build fails below" (generic "write tests" elided -> ledger; project delta kept)

**Lossless guard (any mode, A.2/A.4 never target these):** numbers, dates, versions, model IDs
byte-exact (`claude-sonnet-5`, never "Sonnet 5"), CLI flags/options verbatim (`-x`, `--max`),
thresholds/gates/percentages exactly as stated (`>=95%`, `~20%` ceiling), URLs, file paths, ports,
sizes, named entities, negations (`!=`/NEVER/MUST NOT), scope qualifiers (L.8). A drop that touches
any of these is not A.2/A.4 — it is a defect, caught by the 100% sub-gate.

## PQ - Prompt-Quality Rewrite (digest of `.claude/reports/20260912-173000_agents-refresh/prompting-rules.md` R1-R16)

Separate from the 52 numbered rules above (still 8 categories, unchanged count) — a rewrite pass for
prompt-shaped targets (system prompt, agent `.md`, skill `SKILL.md`, hook prompt text, CLAUDE.md),
applied Medium mode and above (never Light — Light stays wording-only, no restructuring). Stays
lossless per the guard above: R1-R16 govern SHAPE and emphasis, never facts.

| ID | Source | Transformation | Bad -> Good |
|----|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| PQ.1 | R1, R15 | Role in one sentence, Return contract next, Scope/Never after — before procedure detail | Role buried after 3 paragraphs of scope -> "You are a code reviewer. Return: findings list, `path:line`, verdict first." then Scope/Never as its own heading |
| PQ.2 | R2 | Same instruction stated once; delete a cross-section repeat | "Never invent scope" stated, then restated 2 sentences later in other words -> keep the sharper phrasing once |
| PQ.3 | R3 | Prohibition -> positive imperative, UNLESS the `!=`/NEVER guards a named, previously-observed failure | "Do not use markdown" -> "Write in flowing prose". Keep snapshot prohibition: `!=re-run text-guard.sh snapshot` (BT-F15 regression); owned-draft checkpoint remains permitted |
| PQ.4 | R4 | Drop scattered ALL-CAPS; keep exactly one true hard-stop (irreversible action) in caps, lower the rest | 4x MUST/CRITICAL in one file -> 1 STOP on the irreversible action (e.g. edit-without-snapshot), 3 become plain imperative |
| PQ.5 | R5 | Remove redundant "think step by step"/bare "verify"/"be careful" filler; retain steps defining real workflow dependencies and evaluation. Do not suppress model reasoning | "Think step by step and double-check" -> delete, or state the goal only |
| PQ.6 | R6 (official Opus 5 guidance; do not generalize to Sonnet/Fable) | Remove carried-over generic self-verification instructions for Opus 5; keep specific gated protocols/thresholds/independent reviews. Other models require their own guidance/evaluation | "Double-check your output before returning" (generic) -> delete. A named gate (`>=95% match, 100% sub-gate`) is not this pattern — keep it |
| PQ.7 | R7 | An agent that itself delegates states an explicit delegate-only-when criterion, low spawn count | "delegate as needed" -> "delegate only for large independent parallelizable work; never to verify your own output" |
| PQ.8 | R8 | State scope explicitly; never rely on the model generalizing a rule to similar items | "apply this rule" -> "apply this rule to every file matching X, not just the first" |
| PQ.9 | R10 | Reference data (fields/flags/thresholds/model IDs) -> table. Real-dependency procedure -> numbered steps. Never mix the two shapes | A flag/target matrix written as prose -> table; a create-in-order procedure kept as numbered prose, not flattened into a table |
| PQ.10 | R11 | A concrete example or named reference file beats an adjective ("clean", "thorough", "professional") | "write clean code" -> "follow the pattern in `skill-creator.md`" or a 2-line before/after |
| PQ.11 | R13 | `[DICT: ...]` header only when it pays: >=5 distinct abbreviations, each reused >=3x, file itself hundreds of lines | A 150-line agent body with 3 abbreviations used twice each -> no DICT header, inline the 3 terms |
| PQ.12 | R14 (recommendation, not a mandate — verify against the specific hook's own miss-rate first) | Recurring reminder text: once at session-start/compaction, throttle or drop the per-turn copy | A reminder injected on every `UserPromptSubmit` AND at session-start/after-compaction -> keep the structural-checkpoint copies, narrow the per-turn one |
| PQ.13 | R16 | State "run independent tool calls in parallel" once per artifact, never per section | 3 sections each repeating the parallel-call instruction -> state it once, delete the other 2 |

## Rules NOT Recommended

| Avoid | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Remove all emojis | Status emojis are dense, meaningful |
| Always use tables | Single-column data denser as bullets |
| Compress everything | Domain terms need full form first time |
| Remove all examples | Claude generalizes better with examples (P.1) |
| Non-standard abbreviations | Stick to T.5 allowed list |
| Overload single prompts | Multiple tasks in one prompt divide attention → hallucination |
| Over-focus on wording | Structure and format matter more than specific word choice |
| Strip all function words / punctuation | Punctuation is load-bearing for context memory (arXiv:2502.15007 LLM-Microscope); ~20% deletion is the safe ceiling — substitute, don't bulk-delete |
| Blind merge of similar-looking facts | Different scope/numbers/conditions = different facts (D.6) |
| Delete every repeated constraint | Sandwich repetition (2x) raises compliance (L.1/L.6); cap at 2 (D.4), don't zero |

## Compression Ratios (Token Efficiency)

These ratios reflect token savings from applying T and S category rules. L category rules improve comprehension quality without necessarily reducing token count.

| Content Type | Typical Savings |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Prose docs | 40-50% |
| Technical specs | 20-30% |
| System prompts | 30-40% |
| README files | 35-45% |

## Compression References

| Mode | Reference | Target |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Standard | `references/standard-compression.md` | 30-50% compression, human-readable. Filler removal, paragraph→bullets, prose→tables |
| Deep | `references/deep-compression.md` | 2-3x compression, LLM-only. DICT header, symbol substitutions, abbreviation dictionary |
| Max | `references/max-compression.md` | 3-4x, LLM-only, opt-in. Atomic fact-lines, ASCII operators, Chain-of-Density pass, 2 mandatory verify rounds |

Standard/deep/max apply C + T + S + D + R + P + L and mode references; Deep/max add A.1-A.4.
Before compression: Light D.1 only; Medium/standard/deep/max D.1-D.4 + D.6; D.5 only multi-file/folder,
executing orchestrator's decision list, never per-file unilateral deletion.
