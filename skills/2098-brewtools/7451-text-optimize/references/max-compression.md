# Max Compression Reference

Max mode = deep compression + atomic-fact-line rewriting + format-aware tables. LLM-only. Opt-in via `-x`/`--max`. ALWAYS runs 2 verification rounds. Use only when caller explicitly wants maximum density and accepts review burden.

Cited research figures are historical results, not universal gains/current-file measurements.
Apply model-specific advice only to its named model; follow current `rules-review.md` authority.

> Inherits everything in `deep-compression.md`, including aggressive lossy rules A.1-A.4 (dotted, rules-review.md category A) with their loss-ledger requirement. Max adds 4 techniques (B1, A1, B3, B4) + 4 guardrails (C1-C4) + mandatory 2-round verify. Dotless A1 below = ASCII operator dialect, distinct from dotted A.1 (line fusion).

## Atomic Fact-Line Decomposition (B1)

Source: arXiv:2605.04426 "Telegraph English". Decompose prose into one independently-addressable fact per line. Each line stands alone: no cross-line pronoun refs (`it`, `they`, `this`). Combine with ASCII operator dialect. Measured: ~50% token reduction @ 99.1% key-fact retention (GPT-4.1).

Rules:
- 1 fact = 1 line
- !=pronouns referring to other lines -> repeat the noun
- !=connective prose ("furthermore", "as a result") -> drop or replace with operator

**Before** (4 sentences):
> The build runs on CI. It compiles the Kotlin sources first. After that it runs the unit tests. If any test fails, the pipeline stops and the artifact is not published.

**After** (4 atomic lines):
> build runs @ CI
> build compiles Kotlin sources first
> build runs unit tests after compile
> test fail -> pipeline stops + artifact !=published

**Measured** (`wc -w`): before 31 words, after 23 words = -25.8% by WORD count only — atomic-fact
style forbids pronouns, so "build" repeats 3x. The paper's ~50% figure above is TOKEN reduction: a
repeated short noun costs less than the pronoun+clause structure it replaces. Word count and token
count diverge here — judge B1 by an actual token estimate, not `wc -w`, whenever a noun repeats.

## ASCII Operator Dialect (A1 — CRITICAL)

Prefer ASCII digraphs over unicode glyphs. Recorded token cost (tiktoken cl100k/o200k):

| Glyph | Tokens | ASCII | Tokens |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| `∵` `∴` `⊃` `≤` `≥` | 2-3 each | `->` `!=` `>=` `<=` `\|` | 1 each |
| `→` | 1 | `->` | 1 (equally cheap + portable) |

Mapping:

| Meaning | Use |
|---------|-----|
| leads-to | `->` |
| not / never | `!=` |
| greater | `>=` |
| less | `<=` |
| or | `\|` |
| because | `bc` or `because` |
| therefore | `so` |
| includes | `includes` |

> The win is DELETING WORDS, not swapping the glyph. `->` and `→` cost the same; prefer ASCII for portability. Replacing "because" (1 tok) with `∵` (2-3 tok) LOSES tokens.

## Format-Aware Tables (B3)

Sources: arXiv:2603.03306 (TOON); Gilbertson (JSON ~= 2x TSV tokens). For FLAT + UNIFORM tabular data, TSV/CSV-style compact rows beat markdown pipe-tables (pipe alignment = token bloat) and beat JSON (~2x TSV).

CONDITIONAL:

| Data shape | Format |
|------------|--------|
| flat + uniform | TSV-style rows |
| nested / irregular | minified JSON |
| any | !=TOML (worst) |

**Before** (markdown pipe-table):
> | id | name | role |
> |----|------|------|
> | 1 | ann | admin |
> | 2 | bob | user |

**After** (TSV-style):
> id name role
> 1 ann admin
> 2 bob user

**Measured** (`wc -w`): before 26 words / 5 lines, after 12 words / 3 lines = -53.8% — a real win on
words; token savings require a named-tokenizer measurement (separator rows carry no data).

## Chain-of-Density Final Pass (B4)

Source: arXiv:2309.04269. After all compression passes, run 1-3 rewrite iterations at FIXED length: each pass fuses 1-3 missing entities from the original back in WITHOUT growing the text (~3 iterations reach human-preferred density). Use to repair entity loss found by verification instead of re-inflating.

## Guardrails (MANDATORY)

These CAP the aggression. Sources: Anthropic context-engineering blog; Anthropic Opus 4.8 prompting guide; arXiv:2502.15007 LLM-Microscope. Dotless IDs C1-C4 are max-mode guardrails — distinct from Claude-behavior rules C.1-C.8 (dotted).

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| C1 | Minimal != short. Optimize signal/token, !=raw token count. Recall-first, precision-second. |
| C2 | Preserve scope qualifiers VERBATIM ("every section, not just the first"). Opus 4.8 follows literally; stripping scope words BREAKS behavior. |
| C3 | ~20% safe-deletion ceiling on function words. !=bulk-strip punctuation (punctuation is load-bearing for context memory). Substitute, !=delete. |
| C4 | Consistent terminology. !=paraphrase a term for variety. |

## Iron Rules (inherited + max-specific)

Inherits ALL of `deep-compression.md` Iron Rules (the lossless guard) unchanged — do not restate the
list here, re-read it there. Max adds:
- Scope qualifiers preserved verbatim (C2)
- 2 mandatory verification rounds, independent methods: claim inventory + self-QA probe (never optional)
- Semantic match must be >= 95%; below threshold -> patch owned loss/review or refuse with loss list
- 100% sub-gate: numbers, names, negations, scope qualifiers

## Stop Condition

Stop pushing max-mode density the instant one of these trips — patch via Chain-of-Density (B4)
instead of deleting further:
- The 20% deletion ceiling (C3) would be crossed
- A B1 atomic line would need a cross-line pronoun to stay readable (the decomposition is now lossy)
- Round 2 self-QA misses a number, name, negation or scope qualifier (100% sub-gate)
- The next fusion pass has no missing entity left to restore (B4 has converged) — ship, do not chase a fixed multiplier past this point

## Verification (2 rounds, mandatory, INDEPENDENT methods)

Never silently ship lossy max output. Two rounds use DIFFERENT methods — they catch different losses.

| Round | Method |
|-------|--------|
| 1 — Claim inventory | Decompose ORIGINAL into numbered atomic claims, ONE predicate per claim (over-decomposition hurts verifier accuracy, arXiv:2411.02400). Check each claim derivable from COMPRESSED. Label: kept \| merged \| lost \| distorted \| elided-known (A.4). Match % = (kept + merged) / total |
| 2 — Self-QA probe | Generate 10-20 questions from ORIGINAL targeting entities, numbers, conditions, negations. Answer each from COMPRESSED ONLY. Mismatch = loss. Patch, recompute both scores |
| Gates | Overall >= 95% AND 100% sub-gate: every number, name, negation, and scope qualifier answerable/verbatim (CompactPrompt arXiv:2510.18043). Failure -> patch owned loss via B4, checkpoint repair immediately, repeat required review. Still failing -> refuse acceptance + full loss list; never ship with caveat |

Immediately checkpoint each known owned atomic write/deletion/repair with
`text-guard.sh checkpoint --run-dir <RUN_DIR> <file>` before further edits/checks; never record
others' intervening changes or manufacture proof during failure/recovery. Mechanical verification
uses `--no-restore`. Full snapshot recovery needs authorization and matching existing draft proof;
missing/mismatched proof -> `RESTORE_REFUSED`, exit 1, current bytes preserved. Writer self-checks
never replace the skill's independent acceptance gate.

Dedup audit: dedup-merged facts count as PRESERVED (kept once). Loss list fmt (1 fact/line, atomic):
> lost: artifact retention policy (30d) dropped
> distorted: "every endpoint" -> "endpoints" (scope weakened, C2 violation)
> merged: TLS-required rule deduplicated, kept once @ Security section (NOT a loss)
> elided-known: generic "write unit tests" advice elided (A.4, counts as loss)
