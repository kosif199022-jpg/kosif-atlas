# Standard Compression Mode

## 1. Scope

Standard mode compresses text while keeping it human-readable. Target: **30-50% reduction**. Unlike deep mode, output must remain clear to humans, not just LLMs. Use for README files, documentation, API references, and user-facing docs.

Research ratios below describe cited studies/examples, not universal gains. Measure this artifact;
preserve names/numbers/negations/scope over a target ratio.

## 2. Filler Removal Patterns

Apply filler removal from `rules-review.md` rule T.6 as baseline. Standard mode additional patterns:

| Pattern | Replace With |
|---------|-------------|
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "For the purpose of" | "For" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "With regard to" | "About" |
| "A large number of" | "Many" |
| "Is able to" / "Has the ability to" | "Can" |
| "In spite of the fact that" | "Although" |
| Passive voice | Active voice where possible |
| "You should" / "You need to" | Imperative verb directly |

## 3. Structural Techniques

- Convert verbose paragraphs to bullet points when listing items
- Use tables for comparisons (3+ attributes across 2+ items)
- Merge paragraphs that repeat the same idea
- Replace long examples with concise ones
- Convert step-by-step prose to numbered lists
- Remove redundant section headers
- Combine related short sections
- Order by importance + put bulk reference content first, instructions/query last (measured up to +30% response quality on long inputs, Anthropic; +21.4% LongLLMLingua). Reorder — never delete — to fix lost-in-the-middle.
- Dedup pass first (D.1-D.4, D.6, rules-review.md): merge accidental repeats before any wording work; cap intentional emphasis at 2 (full early + short echo at end)
- Sentence-level zero-loss pruning: rank sentences — does removal lose any unique atomic fact? Drop zero-loss sentences BEFORE token-level compression (15-20 pts better fidelity at same ratio, arXiv:2410.12388)
- Structure-aware: compress within structural units, never across; keep headers, compress bodies (heading structure aids retrieval)

## 4. Abbreviation Rules (Conservative)

Only abbreviate in:

- Tables (space-constrained)
- Inline code references
- Well-known acronyms (API, URL, CLI, etc.)

Keep full words in prose for readability.

## 5. Verification Checklist

After compression, verify:

- [ ] All facts preserved (names, numbers, dates, URLs, paths, versions)
- [ ] No semantic changes to rules or instructions
- [ ] Negative rules remain negative
- [ ] Examples still present (at least one per concept)
- [ ] Document still readable by a human unfamiliar with the topic
- [ ] Actual ratio measured; 30-50% is a guide, never a reason to lose facts
- [ ] No information merged incorrectly (two different concepts collapsed into one)
- [ ] Headers and structure still logical
- [ ] Terminology kept consistent — same concept uses the SAME term throughout (no paraphrase-for-variety; synonym variation hurts LLM retrieval)
- [ ] Fact-inventory gate: extract atomic facts from original, check each in compressed; (kept + dedup-merged) / total >= 98% — patch any slip, one round
- [ ] Dedup-merged facts counted as preserved, not lost; no two DIFFERENT facts merged into one (D.6)

After each owned atomic write/deletion or repair, immediately record the known draft with
`text-guard.sh checkpoint --run-dir <RUN_DIR> <file>` before further edits/checks. Never record
intervening other-writer bytes or manufacture proof during recovery. Verify with `--no-restore`;
confirmed loss -> patch owned loss and repeat required independent review, or refuse acceptance.
Full restore requires authorization plus matching pre-existing draft proof; absent/mismatched proof
-> `RESTORE_REFUSED`, exit 1, preserve current bytes. Never claim recovery without successful output.

## 6. What NOT to Compress

- Code blocks (compress surrounding prose, not code)
- API signatures and parameters
- Error messages (exact text matters)
- Legal/compliance text
- Version numbers, dates, URLs, model IDs (byte-exact)
- Command-line examples, CLI flags/options, thresholds and gates (`>=98%`, `30-50%`) verbatim

> Never convert config blocks to TOML for "efficiency". Preserve executable formats; cited format
> benchmarks found TOML heavier than YAML/JSON, not a universal ranking. Uniform prompt data:
> markdown tables or TSV/CSV; nested prompt data: compact JSON.

## 7. Before/After Examples

### Example 1: README Intro

**Before** (59 words):
> This project is a command-line tool that is able to help developers in order to automate the process of deploying their applications. It is important to note that the tool supports a large number of cloud providers. Due to the fact that deployment can be complex, this tool simplifies it for the purpose of reducing errors and saving time.

**After** (19 words):
> CLI tool that automates application deployment. Supports many cloud providers. Simplifies complex deployments to reduce errors and save time.

Measured (`wc -w`): 59 -> 19 = -67.8%, above the 30-50% default target — short, filler-heavy prose
can legitimately land higher. Treat 30-50% as the safe default for typical docs, not a ceiling.

### Example 2: Installation Instructions

**Before**:
> In order to install this tool, you should first make sure to have Node.js installed on your system. You need to verify that your Node.js version is 18 or higher. After you have confirmed this, you should run the following command. Please note that you may need administrator privileges.

**After**:
1. Install Node.js 18+
2. Run the install command (may require admin privileges):
   ```
   npm install -g tool-name
   ```

### Example 3: Prose Comparison to Table

**Before**:
> The free plan supports up to 3 projects and provides 1 GB of storage with community support. The pro plan supports unlimited projects and provides 50 GB of storage with email support. The enterprise plan also supports unlimited projects but provides 500 GB of storage with dedicated support.

**After**:

| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|---------|------|-----|------------|
| Projects | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Storage | 1 GB | 50 GB | 500 GB |
| Support | Community | Email | Dedicated |

## 8. Stop Condition

Stop compressing the moment: the next cut would touch a name/number/path/version/flag (lossless
guard, `rules-review.md`); a paragraph-to-table conversion would need to invent a category the
source never stated; or a further sentence merge would combine facts with different scope/numbers/
conditions (D.6). The 30-50% target is done at that point even if the actual ratio lands outside it
either way — report the real number, never force one to fit the range.
