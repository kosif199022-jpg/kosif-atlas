# Cleanup Git

All deletion goes through the cleanup script: the target repo's own `scripts/cleanup-git.sh` if it ships one, otherwise this skill's `scripts/cleanup-git.sh`. Do not hand-write branch or worktree deletion commands.

```bash
scripts/cleanup-git.sh                  # preview (default)
scripts/cleanup-git.sh --apply          # delete after user approval
scripts/cleanup-git.sh --apply --force  # also delete branches with ahead commits
scripts/cleanup-git.sh --base <ref>     # override base detection
```

The script fetches and prunes remotes, then picks the base from the remote default branch, then local or remote `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop`, or `dev`.

## What the script decides

A branch or its worktree is a candidate when one of these holds:

- `PR merged`: `gh pr view <branch>` reports `MERGED`. This catches squash and rebase merges; ahead commits count only past the PR head commit.
- `upstream gone`: the tracking branch was deleted.
- `merged`: the branch is an ancestor of the base.

It always skips the current worktree, the current branch, the base, and `main`/`master`/`trunk`/`develop`/`dev`. It keeps dirty worktrees. It keeps candidates with ahead commits, or an unknown ahead count, unless `--force` is passed. A branch with none of these signals prints `skip ... (active)`; without `gh`, squash-merged branches land there.

## Workflow

1. Run the preview and show it. Read each line literally: `remove <worktree>` and `delete <branch>` are candidates; `KEEP ... (dirty)`, `KEEP ... (N ahead — use --force)`, and `KEEP ... (ahead unknown — run git fetch ...)` need the user; `skip` lines for the current, base, or protected branch are guarded; mention `skip ... (active)` lines when `gh` is unavailable.
2. Present every `KEEP` line as a decision for the user.
3. Ask before `--apply`. Add `--force` only when the user confirms the ahead commits are throwaway.

Stop if the directory is not a git repo. If no base is found, ask for `--base <ref>`. A fetch failure makes the preview use stale refs (say so) and makes `--apply` refuse.

## Output

```text
GIT CLEANUP
Status: PREVIEW | APPLIED | BLOCKED
Base: <ref>
Remove: <branch/worktree> — <reason>
Keep: <branch/worktree> — <reason and decision needed>
Verification: <command> — pass/fail/not run
```
