# Worktree Edge Cases

Cases the scripts refuse or leave to you.

- Path exists: pick another branch name, or remove the leftover directory after the user confirms. Remove only paths under `<project>.worktrees/`.
- Branch checked out in another worktree: work there, or pick another branch. If that worktree's directory is gone, `git worktree prune` clears the stale registration.
- Base ref not found: fetch or pass `--base <ref>`.
- Setup refused (no lockfile, conflicting lockfiles or manager): run the project's documented install command, and ask if none exists.
- Cleanup when `gh` is missing or cannot see the PR: ask the user to confirm the merge and check `git -C <worktree> status --short`, since `--force` also discards dirty files; then run `scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh --force <branch>`.
- Refused because the branch has commits past the merged PR head, or the PR head is not local: `git fetch` first; if still refused, show `git log <pr-head>..<branch>` and use `--force` only when the user says those commits are throwaway.
- `git worktree remove` fails on a merged worktree because it is dirty: show `git -C <worktree> status --short`, and use `--force` only when the user says those changes are throwaway.
- `git branch -d` refuses after a squash or rebase merge: that is expected; use `-D` once the PR is confirmed merged.
- The shell was inside the removed worktree: `cd` to the main worktree before running further commands.
