# pr-flow

The main checkout of every repo stays on its default branch. Work that changes
files happens on a branch in a worktree, goes up as a PR, and the PR is watched
until green. The tool is `pr-flow` — on Claude Code the plugin puts it on
`PATH`; otherwise run `./pr-flow.py` beside this file with `python3`. Every verb prints a final
line `pr-flow: <verb> <verdict> [<url-or-path>]` on success; a refusal exits 2
with a `pr-flow: <reason>` line on stderr instead. Act on the verdict.

## Procedure

1. **Read first, on main.** Investigation, planning and questions need no branch.
   The trigger for step 2 is the first edit, not the task start.
2. **Start** — `pr-flow start <slug>` from the main checkout (`<slug>` becomes
   `feat/<slug>`; give a full `fix/…` name to choose the prefix; `--base
   <branch>` builds off something other than the default branch, and is
   remembered for `open`/`watch`/`teardown` on this branch). It prints the
   worktree path — use that printed path, never a guessed one — under
   `.claude/worktrees/` (named after the branch, `/` replaced by `-`), and
   creates the `.agents/worktrees` symlink in any repo on first use. From here
   every file operation and command uses that path — absolute paths for file
   tools, `cd <path> &&` or `git -C <path>` for commands.
   A dirty main checkout (uncommitted edits, possibly someone else's) makes
   `start` refuse by default — rerun with `--carry` to move all of it into the
   new worktree, `--carry <path>...` for specific paths only, or `--leave-dirty`
   when none of it is yours: it stays on main, untouched. A local branch
   of the same name with no worktree is refused up front, and if creating the
   worktree fails after a carry the carried work is put back on main first.
3. **Work and commit** in the worktree. Stage only files you changed.
4. **Open** — `pr-flow open`. Pushes, creates the PR against the branch's
   recorded base (or reuses the branch's), prints the full URL. In a clone of
   a fork the PR targets the upstream repo with an owner-qualified head, as
   gh requires. Repeat the URL
   in every message that mentions the PR. It refuses (before pushing) a branch
   with no commits ahead of its base — usually a commit a hook rejected. It
   refuses when the branch's PR is already merged (exit 2 — run `pr-flow start`
   for new work instead) and opens a fresh PR when the old one was closed.
5. **Watch** — `pr-flow watch`, after every push. It blocks up to one hour; it
   prints `next poll in Ns` to stderr before each wait, and tolerates transient
   `gh` failures (gives up after 10 in a row, exit 2). An empty check list is
   resolved by asking GitHub for Actions runs on the head: zero runs on a PR
   GitHub already calls mergeable, held for `--no-runs-confirm` seconds
   (default 20), means no CI applies (a docs-only PR under paths-filtered
   workflows) and is a verified `green`; otherwise the empty list is polled,
   at most every `--no-checks-poll` seconds (default 15), for up to
   `--no-checks-grace` seconds (default 300) before being treated as an
   unverified green, so a check that lands late still counts, and a snapshot
   whose head is not yet the commit you pushed is waited out the same way
   (`PR head … is not the pushed … yet` on stderr is normal right after a
   push). It returns one verdict:
   - `green` (exit 0): report the URL; the turn is done unless merge was authorized.
   - `merged` (exit 0): someone merged it; the tool already tore the worktree down.
   - `checks-failed` (10): the failed job's log is in the output. Fix it in the
     worktree, commit, push, watch again.
   - `conflict` (11): in the worktree `git fetch origin && git merge origin/<base>`,
     resolve, commit, push, watch again. Never force-push to resolve a conflict.
   - `review` (12): unresolved review threads, changes requested, a draft PR, or
     one blocked by branch protection. Address each thread (bot reviewers
     included) or the blocking condition, push, reply on the thread, watch again.
   - `closed` (13): stop and report.
   - `timeout` (14): nothing finished within the hour; watch again.
   - `attempts-exhausted` (15): five fix rounds used and the sixth verdict is
     still a fix-class one. Stop and report what is still red — the user
     decides.
   `--merge` binds to the exact commit it last saw green
   (`--match-head-commit`); if the head moved since, it refuses (exit 2) rather
   than merging a commit nobody watched — run watch again. It only ever
   creates a merge commit, so a repo that allows squash or rebase only refuses
   too; the refusal carries gh's own message plus the likely causes (head
   moved, merge commits disabled, branch-protection rule unmet). A `green`
   whose head is behind the base is reported with a hint: under "require
   branches to be up to date" the merge will be refused until you merge
   `origin/<base>` in and push. A `green` reached
   only because a grace window expired (checks never reported but GitHub
   could not confirm no run exists, or the PR head never caught up with the
   push) still exits 0 but `--merge` refuses and says so on stdout: merge by
   hand once you have evidence. A no-CI green (`no CI applies to this PR` on
   stdout) is verified and `--merge` proceeds.
6. **Merge only when told.** `pr-flow watch --merge` is allowed only when the
   user said, ahead of time and for this task, that the PR may be merged when
   green. Silence means no. A green PR without that permission ends the turn
   with the URL. A standing approval for a class of PR in the user's own
   instructions (e.g. "wiki-only PRs may merge when green") counts — use
   `pr-flow watch --merge-if-only <prefix>` (e.g. `.wiki/`): it merges only when
   every path the PR changes, at the commit it saw green, is under that prefix,
   and otherwise reports `green` unmerged with the first path outside it.
7. **Teardown** — `pr-flow teardown` after the PR is merged (`--merge` does it
   itself). It removes the worktree, deletes the local branch **and deletes the
   branch on origin**; a branch counts as merged when it is an ancestor of
   `origin/<base>` or GitHub has a merged PR for it (squash and rebase merges
   leave no ancestor). When a `devc` executable is on PATH it first runs
   `devc down <worktree>` to remove the worktree's dev container, image and
   per-worktree volumes; a failure there is a warning, never a blocked teardown.
   `pr-flow gc` tears down every worktree whose PR has
   merged; run it when you notice stale worktrees.

## Editing on main anyway

Allowed only when the user says so for that task, or the file never goes
through a PR (an untracked `.env`, a local overlay). A hint may appear after
an edit on main — it is a reminder to run `pr-flow start`, not a block.

## Traps

- A linked worktree has no `.env` and is not the checkout services run from:
  never render or restart a service from a worktree; deploy from main after
  merge.
- Slugs, not UUIDs, in branch and directory names — a UUID-shaped path trips
  secret scanners.
- A tool that switches the main checkout to another branch to "test" a change
  breaks everything that watches main; test the worktree in place instead.
