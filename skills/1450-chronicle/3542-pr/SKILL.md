# Chronicle PR Skill

Spawn ONE **Storykeeper**. The Storykeeper owns the whole flow: it analyzes the
branch, writes a reviewer-legible title and body to a file, and opens the request
from that file. This keeps all branch/diff/`gh` output out of the main
conversation, and it preserves the "why" behind the change.

## Topology

```
main agent  (holds the conversation = the "why")
  └─ chronicle:storykeeper   (sonnet; subagent_type — a custom agent, NOT a fork)
       ├─ analyze-branch.ts   → branch material file + textPath
       ├─ writes { title, body } to textPath (4 sections, optional overview diagram)
       └─ request-creator.ts --material --text  → opens the PR/MR, returns the URL
```

Spawn via `subagent_type`, never fork. Spawn exactly one Storykeeper, in one
`Agent` call, with no `name`. It spawns nothing itself and does not inherit the
main conversation.

There is **no final creation confirmation gate**. Invoking the skill is the
consent. The flow auto-creates after any first-run config interview. `draft`
defaults to `false`, so the request opens ready for review. The main agent may
pass `draft:true` to open it as a draft.

The agent lives at `packages/chronicle/agents/storykeeper.md` and auto-registers
as `chronicle:storykeeper`. Its full procedure — the four-section body spec, the
optional Mermaid overview diagram, and the `CreateResult` contract — lives there.

## The main agent's job (thin)

1. **Resolve the base branch before spawning.** Run the config resolver:

   ```bash
   bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pr-config.ts"
   ```

   Parse its status:

   - `status === "configured"` → use its `base`. Do not ask again.
   - `status === "needs-setup"` → this is the first run. Use the harness's interactive
     question tool to ask whether the repository uses GitHub Flow or Git Flow. Always
     offer both workflows. Use the returned `suggestions` only to prefill and recommend
     branch names detected from the repository. In Claude Code, use `AskUserQuestion`. In
     Codex, use `request_user_input` when available. If no structured question tool is
     available, ask directly and resume only after the answer. State in the question
     that the selection will create and commit `.chronicle/pr.json` on the current branch.
     - GitHub Flow: confirm its PR base. Then run
       `bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pr-config.ts" save github-flow "{base}"`.
     - Git Flow: confirm its production and development branches. Then run
       `bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pr-config.ts" save git-flow "{production}" "{development}"`.
     - Parse the saved result and use its `base`. The save command only writes
       `.chronicle/pr.json`. It never stages or commits.
     - Compare the current branch with the selected GitHub Flow `base` or Git Flow
       `production`. Apply the existing protected-branch confirmation when they match.
       Then run this as a visible shell command. This lets the PreToolUse guard inspect
       the literal `git commit` before anything is staged:

       ```bash
       git add -- .chronicle/pr.json && git commit --only \
         -m "🔧 chore: Configure Chronicle PR workflow" -- .chronicle/pr.json
       ```

       The config-only pathspec preserves unrelated staged changes. If the guard
       refuses or the commit fails, report it and stop. Never hide the commit inside
       `pr-config.ts`.
   - `status === "error"` or invalid config → report the error and stop. Never ignore a
     broken committed config and fall back to guessing.

   A base explicitly named in the user's current request overrides the resolved base for
   this invocation only. It does not rewrite config. See
   [references/pr-config.md](references/pr-config.md) for the schema and routing rules.

2. **Ask whether this PR needs review.** Use the harness's interactive question tool —
   `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex. Offer two options:
   "Needs review" (recommended, the default) and "No review needed". Ask once, on every
   run, before spawning. Never infer the answer from the diff size or the branch name.

   - "Needs review" → `skipReview` is `false`.
   - "No review needed" → `skipReview` is `true`. `request-creator.ts` appends
     ` [skip-review]` to the title. Do not write the marker into the title yourself,
     and never ask the Storykeeper to.

   If no structured question tool is available, ask in plain text and resume only after
   the answer. If the user already stated the answer in the current request ("no review
   needed", "skip review"), take it and skip the question.
3. **Distill the `contextBrief`** — a tight summary of *why* this branch exists,
   drawn from this conversation (the Storykeeper can't see the chat).
   This is the only "why" it gets beyond the cockpit trail and commits.
4. **Spawn the Storykeeper** (`subagent_type: "chronicle:storykeeper"`), passing:
   - the **skill directory** — the skill's load-time "Base directory for this
     skill" banner value (so the Storykeeper resolves `<skill dir>/scripts/analyze-branch.ts`
     and `<skill dir>/scripts/request-creator.ts`). Do not hard-code a
     repo-relative path or rely on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
     Pass it as a **literal absolute path**, never as a `$`-prefixed token —
     nothing sets that variable in the Storykeeper's shell, so its command silently
     runs against `/`.
   - `contextBrief` (from step 3).
   - `base` — the explicit branch selected in step 1. Never pass `auto`.
   - `branch` — the current branch. If it is a protected branch, defer to the user's
     existing git-flow guard before spawning.
   - `draft` — optional. Default `false`. Pass `true` only if the user asked to open
     the PR as a draft.
   - `skipReview` — the answer from step 2. Always pass it explicitly.

**On `PR NOT PUSHED`:** no remote branch of the same name contains `HEAD`. Ask the
user whether to push. On yes, run `git push -u <remote> <branch>` visibly, then
rerun only the creator with the two paths from the report — the drafted text is
already on disk, so nothing is redrafted:

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/request-creator.ts" --material "{outputPath}" --text "{textPath}"
```

Append `--draft` and `--skip-review` exactly as you passed them to the Storykeeper.

**Verify before reporting:**

- URL returned: confirm with `gh pr view "{url}"` or `glab mr view "{id-or-url}"`. A
  non-zero check means treat it as no URL.
- No URL (or failed check): before reporting failure, look for a request that already
  exists for `<branch>` — the creation may have landed before the error:

  ```bash
  gh pr list --repo "{repo-if-cross-fork}" --head "{qualified-head-or-branch}" \
    --state open --json url --jq '.[0].url'
  glab mr list --source-branch "{branch}" --state opened -F json \
    | jq -r '.[0].web_url // empty'
  ```

  A hit is the result. Report it as pre-existing/recovered, not newly created.
  Empty output or a non-zero exit → report no PR/MR plus Storykeeper's reason.
  Never infer a URL.

## Codex

Codex uses the same topology through one of two role-loading paths:

1. **Named-role selector available**: spawn exactly one registered
   `chronicle_storykeeper`, passing the literal skill directory, `contextBrief`,
   `base`, `branch`, `draft`, and `skipReview`.
2. **Generic sub-agent API only**: first verify the stable role files exist under
   `$CODEX_HOME/agents/chronicle/` (default `$CODEX_HOME` to `~/.codex`). Spawn
   exactly one non-fork generic agent with task name `chronicle_storykeeper` and no
   inherited turns. Tell it to read and obey the `developer_instructions` in
   `storykeeper.toml` before it handles the same six inputs. Do not paste or
   improvise the role instructions in the spawn prompt.

If the registered role and stable TOMLs are both unavailable, tell the user to run
`chronicle:install` and start a new Codex thread. Do not silently replace the
Storykeeper boundary with an inline flow.

Apply the same **Verify before reporting** steps after Codex returns.

## OpenCode only — skip on Claude Code and Codex

Follow `~/.config/opencode/skills/pr/references/opencode.md` instead of the
spawn instructions above — bare agent names, no context inheritance, a literal
skill directory. The path is absolute because OpenCode prints no skill
base-directory banner.

## Edge Cases

- **No commits**: the Storykeeper returns `nothing to propose` and stops.
- **No `.chronicle/pr.json`**: run the first-use workflow interview and commit the
  generated config with the current branch.
- **Invalid `.chronicle/pr.json`**: report the validation error and stop; committed
  intent must be fixed explicitly.
- **Unknown provider** (no recognizable `github`/`gitlab` remote): the Storykeeper stops
  before creation — there is nothing it can open.
- **Branch not pushed**: `request-creator.ts` refuses before calling `gh`/`glab`;
  see **On `PR NOT PUSHED`** above.
- **Creation failure** (missing CLI / no remote / CLI error): `request-creator.ts`
  returns `{ ok:false, reason, message }`; the Storykeeper relays it plainly. Never
  pretend success.
