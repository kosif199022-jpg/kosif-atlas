# Commit under the OpenCode harness

The topology is the same as the Claude Code flow: spawn ONE Lawspeaker and let it
run the whole flow itself. Only the two items below differ.

## The agent name is bare

OpenCode agents carry no `chronicle:` prefix:

```text
subagent_type: "lawspeaker"
```

## Nothing is inherited

OpenCode task-tool subagents do **not** inherit parent context. Pass
`contextBrief`, `branch`, `mode`, and any `exclude` explicitly on the spawn, exactly as in the
Claude Code flow, plus the **skill directory** as a literal:

```text
skill directory = /Users/<you>/.config/opencode/skills/commit
```

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty and there is no skill base-directory banner, so that
path has to be stated rather than resolved. State it **tilde-free** — the agent
quotes it, and `~` does not expand inside quotes. Expand `$HOME` yourself and pass
the result.

## Spawn depth

This skill is flat: the Lawspeaker spawns nobody, so it runs at OpenCode's default
`subagent_depth` of `1`. Every chronicle skill is flat now.
