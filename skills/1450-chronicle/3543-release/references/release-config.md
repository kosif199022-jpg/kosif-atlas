# `.chronicle/release.json` — the release config

Chronicle records a repo's release shape **once**, in a committed
`.chronicle/release.json`. Every later `/chronicle:release` then reads it, instead of
re-guessing. Auto-detection (`analyze-release.ts`'s `detectShape`) only seeds the
first-run interview defaults. The committed config is the source of truth.

Commit the file (it's shared team/session state, not a personal dotfile).

## Schema

```jsonc
{
  // "whole-repo": one release unit, one repo-wide tag.
  // "per-component": independently-versioned units, each with a scoped tag.
  "mode": "whole-repo",

  // "git-flow" (default when the field is absent) | "github-flow". See below.
  "workflow": "git-flow",

  // Tag template. {version} is required; {component} only in per-component mode.
  "tag": "v{version}",                         // per-component: "{component}-v{version}"

  "changelog": "CHANGELOG.md",
  "branches": { "develop": "develop", "main": "main" },

  // whole-repo bump targets. [] = changelog + tag only (no version file to bump).
  "versionFiles": [
    { "path": "frontend/package.json", "kind": "json" },
    { "path": "config/application.rb", "pattern": "VERSION\\s*=\\s*[\"']([^\"']+)[\"']" }
  ],

  // Optional. Committed build outputs — checked, never rewritten. See below.
  "artifacts": [{ "path": "bin/workbench", "build": "cargo build --release" }]

  // per-component instead uses "components" (see below); omit "versionFiles".
}
```

### `workflow` / `branches`

`workflow` says how `/chronicle:release` finishes. It also says which branches
the config has to name. It uses the same vocabulary as `.chronicle/pr.json`:

- **`"git-flow"`** — two long-lived branches. `branches` names both `develop` and
  `main`. The finish commits the bump on `develop`. It merges `develop → main` and
  cuts every tag on that merge commit. It merges back, then ends on `develop`.
- **`"github-flow"`** — one long-lived branch. `branches` names only `main` — call it
  whatever the repo calls it: `main`, `master`, `trunk`. A `develop` key is ignored.
  The finish commits the bump on `main`. It cuts every tag on **that bump commit**,
  then ends on `main`. Nothing is merged.

```jsonc
{
  "mode": "whole-repo",
  "workflow": "github-flow",
  "tag": "v{version}",
  "changelog": "CHANGELOG.md",
  "branches": { "main": "main" },
  "versionFiles": []
}
```

Either way **every tag of a coordinated release lands on one commit** — the merge
commit on git-flow, the bump commit on github-flow.

**A missing `workflow` means `git-flow`.** Chronicle never re-detects the workflow
behind a committed config; detection only seeds the first-run interview, where no
`develop` branch (local or `origin/`) suggests `github-flow`. When a committed
config names a `develop` that no longer exists, the analyzer reports
`workflowDrift` and `/chronicle:release` offers the hand edit — add
`"workflow": "github-flow"`, remove `branches.develop` — instead of failing
mid-finish.

### `versionFiles` / component `versionFiles` entries

Each entry is one of:

- `{ "path": "...", "kind": "json" | "toml" | "text" }` — a known format:
  - `json` — the first top-level `"version": "..."` (plugin.json, package.json).
  - `toml` — `version = "..."` (Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml).
  - `text` — the whole file is the version (a `VERSION` file).
- `{ "path": "...", "pattern": "...(capture)..." }` — a regex whose **first capture
  group** is the version substring. This is the escape hatch for anything
  non-standard — a Rails `config/application.rb` constant, a `version.rb`, a
  `__version__` in Python, a version baked into a shell script. Chronicle rewrites
  only the captured span. Surrounding formatting stays untouched.

#### Cargo.lock

A Rust crate's version lives in **two** files: `Cargo.toml` and its `Cargo.lock`
package block. Detection writes both, the lock as a name-anchored pattern:

```jsonc
{ "path": "Cargo.lock", "pattern": "name = \"my-crate\"\\nversion = \"([^\"]+)\"" }
```

Never point `kind: "toml"` at a lockfile. A lock carries one `version = "..."` per
package — hundreds of them — and the plain `toml` rule would move whichever sorts
first, corrupting the lock. Only the block under `name = "<crate>"` may move.

Workspaces share one root lock: every member component lists the same
`Cargo.lock` path with its own crate name in the pattern.

Detection runs once, so a config committed before this existed lists only
`Cargo.toml`. The analyzer reports that as `versionFileDrift` — one entry per
`manifest` whose companion is `missing` — and `/chronicle:release` offers the edit at
the gate. It never applies it silently, for the same reason it never re-shapes the
workflow: the committed config is the source of truth.

### `artifacts`

A committed build output carries the version the manifest had **when it was built**.
No bump can rewrite it, so the release checks it instead:

```jsonc
"artifacts": [
  {
    "path": "bin/workbench",        // repo-relative; staged with the release commit
    "command": "./bin/workbench --version",  // optional; this is the default
    "build": "cargo build --release && cp target/release/workbench bin/"  // optional
  }
]
```

The `artifacts` stage runs each `command` after the bump and requires the target
version in its output. A stale artifact stops the release **before `tag`** — after a
pushed tag the only fix is a force-push. With `build` set, the stage runs it and
re-checks; without it, the release stops and asks for a rebuild.

Per-component configs put `artifacts` on the component, next to its `versionFiles`.

Declare only an artifact the repo actually commits. `git add` refuses a gitignored
path, which would break the release commit.

### per-component mode

```jsonc
{
  "mode": "per-component",
  "tag": "{component}-v{version}",
  "changelog": "CHANGELOG.md",
  "branches": { "develop": "develop", "main": "main" },
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "chronicle",
      "path": "packages/chronicle",
      "versionFiles": [
        { "path": "packages/chronicle/.claude-plugin/plugin.json", "kind": "json" },
        { "path": "packages/chronicle/.codex-plugin/plugin.json", "kind": "json" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`path` scopes a component's changelog diff (`git log {tag}..HEAD -- {path}`) and its
"did it change?" commit count. Each component lists **all** of its version files. For
example, a plugin that ships to two harnesses lists both of its `plugin.json` files. The changelog header is per-component (e.g.
`## [chronicle 0.5.0]`). See `monorepo-release.md`.
