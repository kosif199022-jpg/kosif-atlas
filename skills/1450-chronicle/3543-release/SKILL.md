# Chronicle Release

A release is a short list of stages, run by `scripts/release.ts`. Each stage knows
whether it has already happened by looking at the repo, so a run picks up wherever
the last one stopped and re-running one is a no-op rather than an error.

You own the two things a script cannot do: **putting every decision to the user in
one gate**, and — on a first run — **interviewing the repo's shape**. The changelog
entry needs judgment too, so one agent writes it.

Run the scripts yourself, with Bash. Each prints four or five lines — the gate's
own questions, answered — so relaying them through an errand-runner would put a
model between you and a version number to save nothing. The full analysis stays on
disk at `outputPath`, and `--json` prints it instead when you need a field the
digest leaves out. Only the changelog entry goes to an agent, because only it reads
a whole range of commits.

## Stages

```
save-config?  bump  [artifacts]  entry  commit  [merge]  tag  [back-merge]  push
                                    ▲                     ▲                  ▲
                          prepare ──┘             local ──┘       default ───┘
```

`merge` / `back-merge` exist only on git-flow. `save-config` only on a first run.
`artifacts` only when the config declares a committed build output.

## Modes → `--through`

- `/chronicle:release` → `--through push`. The default: bump, entry, commit, tag,
  and publish.
- `/chronicle:release local` → `--through tag`. Everything except the push.
- `/chronicle:release prepare` → `--through entry`. Bump and write the entry, then
  stop. You review and commit.

`auto` and `auto push` are aliases for the default: `--through push`, push
confirmation included.

**A `push` run needs the user's explicit go-ahead.** Name the remote, the branches,
and every tag, and get a yes. Batching it into step 3's gate moves that question
earlier; it never makes it shorter or optional. Nothing else in the flow waives it:
not a version token, not a mode word, not a resumed run. Downgrade to `local` when
the user declines the push but wants the rest.

Run after a `prepare`, the default finishes it: `bump` and `entry` already read as
done, so it commits what is there and tags that commit. It never writes a second
bump or a second entry.

A version token (`0.5.0`) or component token(s) (`chronicle`, or `chronicle monitor`)
may follow any mode to skip **the version question only** — never the push
confirmation. Naming two or more components
cuts a coordinated release: one commit, N scoped tags. A bare version token only
disambiguates a single-unit release — with several components named, ignore it and
ask each bump. A per-component `chronicle@0.5.1` form is fine if the user writes it.

## Running the scripts

Run each command **once per step**. `plan` then `run` are two different commands, not
a rerun, and re-running `run` after an artifact rebuild is the documented fix, not a
retry. What is forbidden is reaching for a *different* command after one fails: never
rerun a failed command with changed flags, never substitute another script, and never
hand-roll the git a stage would have done.

Read the exit code, not just stdout. `plan`'s exit 1 is the one non-zero that carries
a usable result — the blocked stage in step 5. **Every other non-zero exit ends the
release**: report the exit code and the last meaningful line of stderr, summarizing a
stack trace to its message rather than pasting it, and stop. Exit 2 means the script
refused before doing anything — no config, malformed `units`, a missing `--through` —
so there is no digest to read and nothing to carry forward. A script that exits 0
but prints nothing is a failure too, and say so instead of guessing what it meant.

Each command prints a digest for you to act on, never for a machine to parse. Quote a
line back to the user when it matters; do not paste the whole block into your reply.

## Your job

### 1. Facts

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze-release.ts"
```

`{SKILL_DIR}` is the skill's load-time "Base directory for this skill" banner.
Substitute the literal absolute path before running. Do not hard-code a path, do
not rely on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and never leave a `$`-prefixed token in the
command — nothing sets that variable, so it expands to empty and the command runs
against `/`.

You get one line per changed unit, one collapsing the unchanged ones, the config
and branch, and the payload path:

```
chronicle  0.15.1 → patch 0.15.2 · minor 0.16.0 · major 1.0.0   6 commits since chronicle-v0.15.1
unchanged  dispatch guard herdr monitor relay
config     github-flow · branch main · no drift
payload    /tmp/q-lab/chronicle/release/analysis-….json
```

`[files already at X]` on a unit's line is the `fileVersion` case in step 3a.
Any drift prints in capitals on the `config` line — read the payload for its
details, and handle it before the gate. `OFF RELEASE BRANCH` is the third of them:
the current branch is not the one the release commits on, which is step 3b.
`--json` prints the digest's source, `suggested` included on a first run; `--full`
adds `tags` and `config` back.

If `workflowDrift` is set, the committed config still says git-flow but its
`missingBranch` is gone. Say so **before** the gate and offer the one-time edit
(`"workflow": "github-flow"`, drop `branches.develop`). Never apply it silently, and
never run the release against the drifted config.

If `versionFileDrift` is non-empty, the config bumps a `manifest` but not the
companion file carrying the same version — a `Cargo.toml` without its `Cargo.lock`
block. Say so **before** the gate and offer to add each `missing` entry to that unit's
`versionFiles`. Never add it silently. Release without it and the lock keeps the old
version, so the next unrelated `cargo build` rewrites it and drags the version change
into a foreign commit.

### 2. First run only — interview the shape

If `hasConfig` is false, turn `suggested` into a final `ReleaseConfig`
(`references/release-config.md`). Ask only what the defaults cannot settle: whole-repo
vs per-component, git-flow vs github-flow, the tag template, the version files, the
branch names. Add a capture-group `pattern` for odd locations like a Rails
`config/application.rb` — `suggested` will not include those.

Save it before `plan`, because `plan`, `facts`, and `run` all read the config from
disk and exit 2 without it. Write the JSON to a file under a `mktemp -d` directory, then
validate and save it:

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analyze-release.ts" --save-config "{configFile}"
```

Then pass `--persist-config` on the first `run`, so the file rides in the release commit.

### 3. One gate — every decision in a single question call

`AskUserQuestion` carries **up to four questions per call**. Ask all three decisions
below in one call, right after the facts. Never spend a round-trip on one of them
alone: each separate call stalls the run for however long the user is away, and
these answers do not depend on each other. Drop any question the facts already
settle, and never ask one whose answer you hold.

**a. Version — one question per unit.** Resolve one
`{ component, targetVersion, lastTag }` per unit being cut; whole-repo uses
`component: null`.

- **per-component**: if component tokens were given, use those. Otherwise look at
  `commitCount > 0`. Exactly one changed → default to it. Several → offer them all,
  pre-selecting the changed ones. None changed → say there is nothing to release and
  stop, unless the user forces a component and version. `commitCount: null` means
  unknown, not unchanged.
- **whole-repo**: ask the bump from the top-level `bumps`. If `current` is null,
  ask for a starting version (offer `0.1.0`).
- **When `fileVersion` already leads `lastTag`,** a previous prepare run — or a bump
  merged from a feature branch — already chose the version. Offer `fileVersion` as
  the target instead of asking for a bump. Confirm it; do not bump on top of it.

More units than the four-question budget leaves room for: ask one question offering
the same bump for all of them, with "different per unit" as an option, and make a
second call only if they pick it. Two calls beat a wrong version.

**b. How the work reaches the release branch** — ask only when step 1's `config`
line reads `OFF RELEASE BRANCH`. Three options: open a PR, merge locally with
`--no-ff` now, or the work is already there and this is a bump-only release. Step 4
acts on the answer.

**c. The push** — on a `push` run, always, and phrased in full. The option text
names the remote, the branch, and every tag: *push `origin main` +
`chronicle-v0.16.0` + `monitor-v3.2.0`*. Batching changes when it is asked, nothing
else about it. A decline means `--through tag`, not a stop.

Build each tag name from the config's template and the versions question a offers.
One version on the table (a version token, or a `fileVersion` confirm) → name that
exact tag. Several bumps offered → list the candidate tags per unit
(`chronicle-v0.15.2 / v0.16.0 / v1.0.0`), so the yes covers the version picked in
the same call and no other. A tag the plan produces that this option never named —
the user typed a version of their own — is a moved ground: re-ask at step 7.

**Re-ask when the ground moves.** An answer is good only for the facts it was given
against. A `BLOCKED` stage, a drift you surface after the gate, a merge that changed
the commit range, or a plan whose tags differ from what the push option named — ask
that question again. Never carry a stale answer into a stage.

> In an active **cockpit** session the gate may go through `needs_your_call` +
> `cockpit wait` (cockpit's `references/pilot.md`) — same batching: one hand-back
> carrying every decision. On exit `4` nobody is watching; ask with
> `AskUserQuestion` as above.

### 4. Land the work on the release branch

Only when step 3b was asked. `plan` computes its base as
`git rev-parse <release branch>`, never `HEAD`, and `run` checks that branch out
before committing — so a release run from a feature branch writes the bump into
that branch's tree, commits it alone onto the release branch, and cuts a tag holding
a version bump, a CHANGELOG entry, and none of the work.

- **PR** → stop here. `/chronicle:pr` opens it; the release resumes after the merge
  lands, from step 1.
- **merge locally** → `git checkout <release branch>` then
  `git merge --no-ff <branch>`. A dirty tree blocks the checkout — commit it first.
  Re-run step 1 afterwards: the commit counts and `fileVersion` have moved.
- **already there** → continue.

### 5. Plan

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/release.ts" plan --units '{units}'
```

The `stages` line lists them in order, a done one marked `✓`. Exit 1 means something is
**blocked** — a `BLOCKED` line names the stage and the reason. Report it and stop.
A blocked stage is always a state the user must resolve (a tag already on another
commit, a `main` behind its remote); never work around it.

**Check the base before going on.** The `plan` line ends `on <sha7> (<branch>,
<workflow>)`. On github-flow that sha must equal `git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD`; on
git-flow it is `main`'s head by design, so check instead that you are standing on
`develop`. A mismatch means the work is not on the release branch — go back to
step 3b. Run this check even when step 1 printed no `OFF RELEASE BRANCH`.

### 6. Entry, if pending

If the `entry` stage is pending, gather the facts:

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/release.ts" facts --units '{units}'
```

It prints one line per unit (commit count, how many the commit type cannot
classify) and the `payload` path. The engine owns the commit list, so none can be
missed. Relay its `[TypeSafe classify …]` line to the user: how long Jev took to
suggest sections for the unclassifiable commits, or why it did not run — no key,
or a key that is failing. Then spawn the annalist **once**, with `subagent_type: "chronicle:annalist"`,
never a fork, no `name`:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "chronicle:annalist",
  prompt: "skill directory (absolute, literal): <the base-directory banner value>. factsPath=<the payload path>. Write the entries file. Return its path."
})
```

Pass the returned path to step 7 as `--entries-file`. The `entry` stage validates
that every commit is accounted for, renders the markdown, and splices it above the
first existing heading. A rejected file names each problem: resume the same
annalist with that list through `SendMessage`, never a second spawn. Skip this
whole step whenever `entry` reads `entry✓` — the entry exists, and a second one for
the same version is a duplicate heading.

### 7. Run

The publish was confirmed in step 3c. Ask again here only when that yes no longer
covers what is about to happen: the gate never ran, or the plan's tags, branch, or
remote are not the ones the option named. Never infer the go-ahead from an answer
given about something else, and treat a decline as `--through tag` rather than a
stop.

```bash
bun "{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/release.ts" run --units '{units}' --through "{stage}" --entries-file "{entriesFile}"
```

Drop `--entries-file` when `entry` already reads `entry✓`.

The result names what executed, what it skipped, the release commit, and the tags.
A stage that runs without taking effect aborts the release — the engine will not
report a tag it did not cut. `executed   nothing` on a resumed run means every
stage was already done, not that the run failed.

### 8. Verify before reporting

- **prepare** → confirm the version files read `targetVersion` and the changelog
  holds the entry.
- **local / default** → for every tag, require non-empty `git tag --list "{tag}"` and
  `git rev-list -n1 "{tag}"` equal to `releaseCommit`. When pushing, also require
  non-empty `git ls-remote --tags origin "{tag}"`.
- Relay only verified results. Never announce an unverified tag or push.

## Committed build outputs

A repo that commits a build output — a compiled binary, a bundled script — carries a
version no bump can rewrite. Declare those as `artifacts` and the `artifacts` stage
asks each one for its version after the bump, and stops the release while one still
reports the old number. It sits before `tag` because everything after a pushed tag is
a force-push.

When the run aborts there, the note names the artifact and what it reported. Rebuild
it and re-run. Give the artifact a `build` command and the stage rebuilds it itself.
Either way the rebuilt file is staged with the release commit.

## Protected branches

Release operates on the branches the config names; don't re-implement branch
protection. A github-flow release commits **on `main` by design**. The engine runs
that commit inside `release.ts`, so no Bash-level guard sees it — only the repo's
own git hooks do; a failing one aborts `commit`, and the fix is the user's. When you
commit by hand after `prepare`, chronicle's `check-branch.sh` exempts a
`🔧 release:` subject on a `.chronicle/pr.json` github-flow base. Answer any other
guard's prompt; don't work around it.

## Codex

Same flow, one role. Run the scripts yourself and spawn the registered
`chronicle_annalist` for the entry — or — with a generic sub-agent API only — a
non-fork generic agent named `chronicle_annalist`, told to read and obey its TOML
under `$CODEX_HOME/agents/chronicle/` (default `$CODEX_HOME` to `~/.codex`).
Never paste or improvise the role instructions. If it is missing, tell the user to
run `chronicle:install`.

## OpenCode only — skip on Claude Code and Codex

Follow `~/.config/opencode/skills/release/references/opencode.md` instead of the
spawn instructions above — bare agent names, no context inheritance, a literal
skill directory. The path is absolute because OpenCode prints no skill
base-directory banner.

## Edge cases

- **No config + can't detect**: whole-repo, `versionFiles: []` — changelog + tag
  only. Confirm the starting version in the gate. `bump` reads done because there is
  nothing to bump, and `commit` then rests on the entry alone.
- **Nothing changed** since the last tag: say so and stop, unless the user forces a
  version.
- **`bump` done but `entry` pending** on a tree you did not just bump: the version
  files moved without an entry behind them. Ask before writing one — either half
  could be the mistake, and only the user knows which.
- **A version file that didn't move**: `bump` will not read done afterwards and the
  run aborts there. Never tag a half-bumped tree.
- **A run started from a feature branch**: `OFF RELEASE BRANCH` on the `config`
  line. Steps 3b and 4 own it. Nothing downstream catches it — the run succeeds and
  the tag is wrong.
- **A repo that migrated to GitHub Flow** after its config was committed: see
  `workflowDrift` above. A missing field is never re-detected on its own.
- **An artifact whose version command cannot run** — missing file, wrong flag — reads
  as stale, never as current. Fix the `command`; never drop the artifact to get past
  the stage.
