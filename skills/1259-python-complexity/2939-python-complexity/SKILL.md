description: "Measure Python complexity per function (ruff C901 cyclomatic and complexipy cognitive) and per call path (hops, argument threading, and pass-through layers), without a project install. Optionally add Jev semantic judgments through a configurable provider (Vercel AI Gateway by default) when a key is available for readability, KISS, responsibility cohesion, and abstraction quality. Use when prioritizing refactors, triaging a legacy package, investigating code that is hard to follow despite small functions, assessing over-layering or indirection, interpreting complexity scores, or verifying a refactor improved the whole path rather than relocating complexity. Static measurements locate candidates; semantic judgments remain advisory and behavior is verified with tests."
when_to_use: "Also fires on: 'is this over-layered', 'too many layers / hops / helpers / indirection', 'every function is tiny but I can't follow it', 'did splitting this up actually help', 'complexity went down after the refactor — did it?', 'a string or enum parameter gets passed through everything', 'which of these layers can go', 'the reviewer says it's over-abstracted'; and on the plain per-function asks — 'which function is worst', 'is this function too complex', 'C901 says 14'."

# Python complexity: two censuses

| | **Per function** | **Per call path** |
|---|---|---|
| Question | which function is hard to read? | which path is hard to follow, although every function on it scores low? |
| Runs | `ruff check --select C901` + `complexipy`, read as a pair | the same two runs, summed, plus `scripts/hops.py` and `scripts/arg_threading.py` |
| Signal | the gap between cyclomatic and cognitive | Σ cognitive, decisions, callables entered, argument threading — as a ratio to a baseline |
| Golf it catches | comprehensions, ternary chains | splitting into pass-through layers |

Each census catches the other's golf. Run the first on any module. Run the second whenever the first comes back green and the code is still hard to follow — and before believing any "complexity went down" that came from a split.

When the selected provider's API key is available and semantic review is wanted, add **census → Jev judgment → agent refactor → tests → census + one paired Jev request on before and after** (`jev_review.py --before … --after …`, which asks what the change introduced and removed instead of scoring each version separately). Jev assesses the selected source and context; the existing tools calculate the metrics. Read [references/jev-review.md](references/jev-review.md) for provider configuration, the helper, both rubrics, and comparison rules. If that provider's API key is unavailable, skip Jev and complete the static census, source review, refactor, and behavior checks. Do not require key setup or block completion; report semantic review as skipped. Static analysis requires no credentials or network access.

## Per function: two numbers, two questions

Run both — neither is trustworthy alone.

| | Cyclomatic (McCabe) | Cognitive (Campbell) |
|---|---|---|
| Tool | `ruff check --select C901` | `complexipy` |
| Counts | branching **statements** | breaks in linear flow, **+1 extra per nesting level** |
| Answers | how many tests cover this? | how hard is this to hold in your head? |
| Blind to | nesting depth, length, expressions | length, params, state, naming |

**The gap between them is the signal.** Identical logic, written three ways (measured, ruff 0.12.7 / complexipy 7.0.1):

| Same 5 conditions, same 6 returns | Cyclo | Cog |
|---|---:|---:|
| flat guard clauses | 6 | 5 |
| nested 5 deep | 6 | **15** |
| nested ternaries | **1** | **15** |

Cyclomatic cannot tell them apart — and scores the *worst* one lowest. Cognitive separates them. That is the whole reason to run two tools.

## When to Use

One function is hard:

- "Which functions should I refactor first?" / "where is the worst code here?"
- Triaging a legacy module or an unfamiliar package before working in it
- Reading a `C901` diagnostic or a complexipy score someone put in front of you

Every function is fine and the code still is not:

- "Every function here is small, so why is it hard to follow?" / "is this over-layered, too indirect, too many hops?"
- A split, extraction, or "clean-up" refactor claims complexity went down — verify it reduced rather than relocated
- Comparing a new implementation against the path it replaces, or against a sibling that solves the same problem
- A reviewer says a value is "passed through everything" — a selector or pass-through variable

## The two census commands

Both run without installing anything into the project.

```bash
# Cyclomatic — every function, including score-1
ruff check --isolated --ignore-noqa --select C901 --config "lint.mccabe.max-complexity=0" \
  --no-cache --output-format concise path/

# Cognitive — every function, one "<file> <function> <score>" line each
uvx complexipy@7.0.1 --plain --no-ignore path/
```

Five things in the ruff line are load-bearing, not decoration:

- **`max-complexity=0`, not `1`.** C901 fires on `>`, so a threshold of 1 silently omits every complexity-1 function — which is exactly where the worst blind spots live (a 200-line straight-line function scores 1).
- **`--isolated`** — a project's `per-file-ignores` can zero out results with no warning. (A plain `exclude` does *not* silence an explicitly-named path, and `force-exclude` at least warns.) Its cost: project `exclude` stops applying, so vendored and migration dirs reappear.
- **`--output-format concise`** — the default `full` prints a six-line block per function.
- **`--select C901`** — the rule is off by default.
- **`--ignore-noqa`** — `--isolated` does **not** override suppression comments. One `# ruff: noqa: C901` at the top of a file makes the census print `All checks passed!` at exit 0 for that whole file. In triage you want the suppressed ones most: a `# noqa: C901` is usually a marker left on the exact function you are looking for.

`--plain` replaces a box-drawn report full of emoji and `✅ PASSED` markers — never parse the default. But `--plain` is not clean either: advisories interleave into the **same stdout stream**, width-wrapped, while stderr stays empty, so `awk '{print $2, $3}'` picks up junk rows. Filter to lines whose last field is an integer (`awk '$NF ~ /^[0-9]+$/'`), or for anything scripted use JSON:

```bash
uvx complexipy@7.0.1 --output-format json --output scores.json --no-ignore -q path/
jq -r '.[] | "\(.path) \(.function_name) \(.complexity)"' scores.json
```

Write JSON to a real file, not `--output /dev/stdout` — a `Results saved at …` line gets appended after the array and `-q` does not suppress it.

`--no-ignore` is the counterpart to ruff's `--ignore-noqa`: a `# complexipy: ignore` otherwise hides a function silently.

## Silent failures that make a clean run a lie

Both tools have cases where they report success while measuring nothing, and the cases do not overlap — which is the practical argument for running both. These are the ones that bite most; the references list more.

**ruff: a mistyped path exits `0`.** You get `warning: Failed to lint …` then `All checks passed!` — indistinguishable from a clean package. Confirm the target resolves first:

```bash
ruff check --isolated --show-files path/   # prints one absolute path per file; silence = nothing matched
```

**complexipy: methods of any class not at column 0 are never reported.** Not just nested classes — a class inside a function, and (the one that matters in practice) a class under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` or `try:`. Measured: a method in `class Wrapper: class Hidden:` produces **zero output and exit 0** where the de-nested body scores **21** and exits 1; a class under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` is likewise invisible while ruff reports its method normally. Ruff sees it either way — but **do not try to detect this by diffing the two row sets.** A ruff row with no complexipy counterpart is normal, not a warning: it happens for every nested `def`, for every method (complexipy qualifies them as `Klass::method`), and for anything carrying `# complexipy: ignore`. The signal fires constantly on healthy code. Read both listings, and treat a complexipy run that is quiet on a file ruff found functions in as worth a look.

Also: complexipy writes errors to **stdout**, not stderr, and its exit `1` conflates "over threshold" with "file not found or unparseable" — do not infer success from an empty stderr, and mind that the census exits `1` on any function over 15, which trips `set -e`. It also drops a `.complexipy_cache/` directory into the working directory.

## Reading the pair

| | **Low cognitive** | **High cognitive** |
|---|---|---|
| **Low cyclomatic** | Fine — or an invisible monster (check length, closure depth, ternary density) — or a **distributed** one: sum along the call path (next section). | Nested ternaries, or a comprehension doing too much. Read it. |
| **High cyclomatic** | `match`, dispatch table, `except` ladder, or nested `def`s. Usually leave alone. | **Real target.** Nesting on top of genuine branching. |

Sort by **cognitive descending, tie-break by the gap** (cognitive − cyclomatic). A wide positive gap means few branches but a lot of held state — the cheapest wins are there.

A wide gap has **two** causes, and the fix differs:

- **Nesting** → flatten to guard clauses. Reliable: 15 → 5 on identical logic.
- **Mixed boolean density** → name the sub-predicates. A single flat `if` with seven alternating `and`/`or` measures 2 cyclomatic / 6 cognitive with zero nesting.

## When every function scores low: the path census

The per-function census has a third monster. Same behaviour, three shapes (ruff 0.12.7 / complexipy 7.0.1; 600,000 differential comparisons, 0 mismatches):

| Same behaviour | defs | max cyclo / cog | Σcyclo − defs | Σcog | callables entered | one name threaded through N signatures |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| one function | 1 | 20 / 47 | 19 | 47 | 1 | 1 |
| split into pass-through layers, a selector string threaded | 26 | **3 / 3** | 20 | 38 | **24** | **10** |
| split by meaning | 9 | 4 / 7 | 9 | 20 | 5 | 2 |

Sorted by cognitive descending, the pass-through split is the *best* of the three, and every one of its 26 functions passes every threshold above. That is layer-golf — the third golf, after comprehensions and ternaries — and a per-function threshold cannot see it because the cost moved *between* functions. A real read path measured the same way: 23 functions, none above cognitive 8, against the 7 it replaced — Σ cognitive 61 vs 24, 34 decisions vs 9, 35 callables entered per public call vs 11.

Two numbers from the census you already ran, summed over the files or the path (`scripts/path_census.py` does both):

- **Σcyclo − defs (− nested defs) = decisions.** McCabe's number is additive over components and *v = π + 1* (1976, p. 314), so subtracting the def count leaves the predicate count — invariant under extraction: 19 → 20 → 9. If it did not fall, the split removed nothing. Sum top-level ruff rows only; de-duplicate `@overload` stubs by name (both tools list them as rows).
- **Σcog.** Campbell's paper: the metric "does not increment for the method structure, [so] aggregate numbers become useful." It falls under extraction (nesting penalties vanish), but 47 → 38 is not 47 → 3.

Three counts no census gives — `scripts/` has each, and each prints what it could not resolve rather than hiding it:

- **callables entered** from one public call — static (`scripts/hops.py`: every arm; what a reader must read) and dynamic (`scripts/hops_dyn.py`: one input; what runs). Report both; static 24 vs dynamic 19 on the same fixture is normal.
- **argument threading** (`scripts/arg_threading.py`) — for each parameter name, how many signatures on the path carry it. Three or more is a pass-through variable.
- **selector sites** (same script, `--name`) — a parameter compared in several functions to re-discover which public call was made.

The path census, runnable (entry is `<module>:<qualname>`, module relative to the package dir with `/` → `.`, methods as `Class.method`):

```bash
# 1. sums, new path against the path it replaced (or a sibling); `:fn1,fn2` picks functions out of a big module
python3 scripts/path_census.py new=pkg/routing.py,pkg/serve.py,pkg/resolve.py old=pkg/legacy.py:read_one,read_all
# 2. callables one public call enters — static, every arm (read `unresolved` before the count) …
python3 scripts/hops.py pkg routing:get_standard --own 'routing|serve|resolve'
#    … and dynamic, one input, when the package imports and the call is cheap
python3 scripts/hops_dyn.py pkg --setup "import routing as R" --call "R.get_standard(contract, 'error', lifts)"
# 3. names carried through ≥ 3 signatures, then every site of the one that looks like a selector
python3 scripts/arg_threading.py pkg --entry routing:get_standard --name method
```

On the fixture above these print, in order: `decisions 20 / cog_sum 38` against `19 / 47`; `callables entered: 24` (dynamic 19); `method 10` and `29 sites … compares 8 … functions that compare on it: 6`. Prune arms the scenario cannot take with `--exclude f1,f2`; stop at service wrappers with `--leaf-decorator name`. On object-heavy code the static count is a **floor** — `hops.py` prints `heuristic` and `unresolved` buckets, and a count with 169 unresolved sites is "≥ N", not N. Say which.

There are no thresholds between functions. Compare against the path the code replaced, or a sibling that solves the same problem: 23 defs / Σcog 61 / 34 decisions against 7 / 24 / 9 is the finding; 61 alone is not.

Golfing these numbers pushes code back toward one function, which the per-function census catches. Golfing the per-function census pushes it toward pass-through layers, which these catch. Same argument as running cyclomatic and cognitive together — one level up.

### Which layers stay

A layer earns its place by naming an invariant it protects: *without this, X happens* — a wrong answer served, an exception reaching a caller that cannot contain it, a forbidden import, a stale value. If X is "the code would be arranged differently", the layer is **structure**, and structure is what the path census counts. Five structural costs recur; each has a count and a usual fix:

| Shape | Symptom | Count | Usual fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| a selector threaded through signatures and compared late, in several functions | the reader holds "which call am I in?" for the whole descent | `arg_threading.py --name` | one typed entry point per shape sharing a private router (*Remove Flag Argument*) |
| a fact decided in one layer, applied in another, threaded back to pick a telemetry tag | fields whose only consumer is a metric call | field → consumer trace; `hops.py` for the distance | apply the rule where it is decided; emit the metric there |
| N fallback helpers with N semantics, some value-identical on every reachable input | "the default" has three homes | list every site producing the same constant; execute the empty/missing cases | one named source of the default; keep the distinct metric tags |
| representation churn — K intermediate types, a conversion run twice, a map rebuilt to read one entry | `hops_dyn.py` invocations exceed the number of keys | `hops.py` "types constructed"; invocation counts | the producer returns the wire shape with the read methods on it |
| a module split forced by an import lint, not by design | "why does this file exist?" → "because X may not import Y" | `hops.py` by-module | switch to the gate form legal on the inner side and fold, or keep and say so |

Before moving a rule between layers, add a fixture whose value is distinct from every default it could be confused with — three constants that all equal 90 let a rule applied twice pass the whole suite. The invariant → verdict table, the sibling comparison, what the tests pin, and the alternatives/before-after tables: [references/layering-review.md](references/layering-review.md). Commands, scripts, and each tool's silent failures: [references/between-function-complexity.md](references/between-function-complexity.md).

## What the numbers cannot see

Measured fixtures scoring **1 cyclomatic / 0 cognitive** — all obviously bad:

- a 203-line straight-line function
- 15 parameters, 7-deep attribute chains, mutating 8 objects
- a function named `validate_user` whose body sets `is_admin = True`
- nine ternaries buried in arithmetic

Two of these are visible to ruff rules the census does not select, in the same run: `PLR0913` (the 15 parameters) and `PLR0915` (the 203 statements — but it counts `return` and `for` as 0, so a one-line forwarder is invisible at any threshold). A third blind spot — `with` and `try/finally` nesting, which cognitive complexity scores at 0 — is seen by `PLR1702 --preview` (a 5-deep pyramid of either: complexipy 0, PLR1702 5). Nothing sees the closure pyramid except `radon cc --show-closures`. Commands and the per-rule quirks are in [references/cyclomatic-ruff.md](references/cyclomatic-ruff.md).

Two specific traps worth memorizing:

- **A 5-level nested-closure callback pyramid scores cognitive 0** — the deepest visual nesting possible, invisible because closures carry no structural increment.
- **complexipy 7.0.1 drops expression complexity under certain parent nodes.** Control: `if a: return 1` plus `return (2 if b else 3) + (4 if c else 5)` scores 1 — identical to the bare `if` alone — while the same `if` with a *bare* ternary scores 2. It is **not** a ternary bug: the same contexts also swallow boolean operators and comprehensions. Whether the cost survives depends on the *parent node*, with asymmetries that give the game away — a dict **value** counts but a dict **key** does not; a **positional** call argument counts but a **keyword** argument does not. Silently dropped: binary and unary operators, f-strings, subscripts and slice bounds, dict keys, keyword arguments, `*`-unpacking, attribute access, `yield` values. 7.0.1 is the latest release and no upstream issue matches, so assume it is live; the tested-context table is in the reference, and untested node types may drop cost too.

Ruff's McCabe **counts statements, not expressions**, so `and`/`or`, ternaries, and comprehension `if` clauses all cost exactly **0**. One consequence, both directions: rewriting an `if` chain as one boolean expression drives the score toward 1 without making it readable, and expanding a dense predicate back into statements *raises* it.

## Thresholds

Only two numbers here are sourced, and neither is a law:

- **Cyclomatic 10** — McCabe 1976, §III p. 314: "a reasonable, but not magical, upper limit." The same page prescribes the response to exceeding it — "recognize and modularize subfunctions" — and §IV proves that modularizing does not reduce the total: the complexity of a collection of components is the sum of their complexities. The threshold and the third golf come from one page. It is ruff's default. (Definition 1 there is *v = e − n + p*; the *e − n + 2p* form is program complexity after the virtual exit→entry edge.)
- **Cognitive 15** — complexipy's tool default (verified by bisection: 15 passes, 16 fails). **Campbell's white paper recommends no numeric threshold at all** — verified across pp. 1–17 of v1.7, including the Appendix B specification; it specifies the metric, not a limit. Do not cite "SonarSource says 15" as a research finding.

Treat both as screening lines that decide *what to read*, never as pass/fail gates.

## Workflow

1. **Census, not screening.** Threshold `0` for ruff; complexipy lists everything by default (`-i` changes only the exit code, not which rows print).
2. **Sort by cognitive, tie-break by the gap.** If the top of the list is all ≤ 8 and the code is still hard to follow, stop sorting and sum: run the path census against a baseline before reading any single function.
3. **Read the top candidates.** The number says *where to look*, never what is wrong. Confirm the shape — nesting, boolean density, or neither — before touching anything. For optional semantic review with an available provider key, evaluate the selected function or complete path with Jev using its task, constraints, and measured evidence. Inspect each judgment separately; `flattening_helpful` and `expression_expansion_helpful` suggest specific transformations to check against ordering, lifetimes, and invariants. The agent identifies and explains the actual code issue.
4. **Pin behavior first.** Get the function under test with branch coverage *before* editing. A falling score is not evidence of behavior preservation; the two are unrelated.
5. **Split by meaning, not to move the number.** If you cannot name the extracted piece without `_part2` or `_helper`, the seam is wrong — put it back. Then count what the split added — callables entered, names threaded through three or more signatures, types introduced. An unchanged decisions count means the split removed no decisions; it can still improve cohesion or readability.
6. **Re-measure and re-read — the path, not the function.** Run the behavior checks and both applicable censuses. If using Jev, repeat the same rubric over the same behavioral scope, including all introduced helpers. Require a concrete maintainability improvement and passing behavior checks; explain metric tradeoffs. Expanding a dense expression can improve clarity while raising cyclomatic complexity. If only the number moved and the path is no easier to follow, revise the refactor.

**Never gate CI on these numbers.** As a merge gate they select for exactly the constructs both metrics undercount: comprehensions, ternary chains, and splitting — an 11/18 function cut into eight ≤ 3s passes every per-function gate. A measured example — a rules loop refactored from 11/18 to 1/6, behavior verified identical over 20,000 randomized inputs — moved the scoring rules into a module-level lambda table and started silently swallowing unknown operators that an `elif` chain had made visible. Cyclomatic fell 91%, and the code got worse.

The metrics are a **locator, not a verdict**. They answer "which 20 of these 800 functions should a human read first?" well — one function at a time. They cannot locate a monster spread over 23 functions that each score under 8; that is what the path census is for. They do not answer "is this function good?"

Jev scores are also signals, not merge gates or proof of correctness. Keep existing repository checks and user-specified limits, but do not invent a universal weighted quality score, require every metric to fall, or treat missing semantic results as a pass. Low confidence or missing context calls for source inspection, not repeated requests until a score improves.
