<skill id="orchestration">

<purpose>
Orchestration is coordination, not implementation. You define contracts, agents
execute, AgentDB is the bus. Never assume completion without reading the file.
Reference on demand: skills/orchestration/reference/orchestration-research.md.
</purpose>

<lane_contract>
Every spawned lane gets ALL of these fields; a missing field is where the lane fails:
1. **Deliverable**: the observable artifact, named exactly (file path, PR, report).
2. **Read-first list**: the files/docs the lane must read before acting.
3. **Files table**: exhaustive list of files it may touch (`constraints.files`).
   No two concurrent lanes may overlap. Contract JSON:
   `{"goal":"X","constraints":{"files":["a.sh","b.md"]},"tier":2}`
4. **Known traps, restated**: gotchas relevant to this lane, inlined, not linked.
5. **Verification loop with exact commands**: the literal commands the lane runs to
   prove its own work (test invocation, grep, curl), plus expected output.
6. **Forbidden list**: what the lane must NOT do (push, touch _meta/, add deps, ...).
7. **Raw-data return format**: counts, file lists, command output. Never narrative
   alone; a lane that returns only prose has returned nothing checkable.
8. **Capabilities needed from outside the runtime**: none | browser | isolated-chromium |
   gui | keychain | ssh | api:vendor | interactive. A lane that needs a capability the
   sandbox denies fails deep into the work, having already spent the budget.

The prompt must stand alone in a fresh session with no conversation history: no "as
discussed", no reference to a target that exists only in your context, no compressed
shorthand only this session can expand. Read it as if you had just booted.
Pass it by FILE PATH once it is large; an inline prompt over a few hundred KB dies on the
subprocess argv limit (E2BIG), and the failure looks like a crash, not a size error.
</lane_contract>

<output_integrity>
Structured long-report lanes degrade silently to placeholders under load. Validate
every lane return mechanically before using it: minimum-length check on required
sections, placeholder detection ("TBD", "...", repeated boilerplate), counts match
the claimed work. Reject-and-retry a degraded return; never synthesize over it.
Pass large input pools to lanes by FILE PATH, never as an inline slice (silent
truncation reads as full coverage). Each lane keeps a per-lane journal/checkpoint
so a degraded final message is not the only record of what it did.
</output_integrity>

<frozen_inputs>
Freeze the exact bytes a review lane judges before dispatching it. A concurrent lane
correcting the same artifact mid-review destroys the review: it now reports on a version
that no longer exists, and the finding cannot be reproduced or dismissed. Snapshot the
input to a path the reviewer reads, record its hash in the contract, and re-check the hash
when the verdict lands. If the source moved, the verdict is void, not stale.
</frozen_inputs>

<shared_resources>
Any id, lock, slot, or row a runner allocates for lanes is contended the moment two lanes
start. Allocate atomically (a real transaction, O_EXCL that is checked, a database
constraint), then READ BACK what you got and fail loudly if it is empty. Exit 0 with a
blank id is the signature of a lost race, and it produces a malformed record that outlives
the run. An O_EXCL lock created during initialization admits a second owner unless the
initialization itself is inside the lock.
</shared_resources>

<single_coordinator>
One coordinator per repo at a time. Before coordinating, check for a live second
session on the same working directory (stale sessions can survive as background
daemons and produce split-brain: two coordinators mutating one repo in parallel).
When killing a stuck session, kill its whole process pool, not just the visible pid.
</single_coordinator>

<worker_model_doctrine>
Select model and effort from the lane's task shape and measured evidence, never from
role prestige. Mechanical total-spec execution with deterministic checks can use the
lowest setting proven adequate. Ambiguous judgment or a measured miss justifies more
effort; protected work requires a fresh independent verifier. The lane contract records
the requested model and effort, whether inheritance is intentional, and the escalation
condition. A prompt that says "use your judgment" is evidence of ambiguity, not a license
to choose a prestige model by role. Receipts keep `requested_model` and `requested_effort`
separate from `observed_model` and `observed_effort`. Unsupported or unexposed values are
`unavailable`, never inferred. Protected receipts require distinct `builder_identity` and
`verifier_identity`; the builder never grades its own protected work. The coordinator
reproduces acceptance evidence.
</worker_model_doctrine>

<fault_tolerance>
1. RETRY transient failures with backoff, max 3. 2. CLASSIFY the failure before choosing
recovery. 3. Never silently substitute model, effort, or provider. Use an alternative only
when the contract names a pre-authorized fallback; record the original request, the failure,
and the observed fallback identity separately. Otherwise stop and re-contract. 4. CHECKPOINT
state to AgentDB at every boundary so a respawn resumes instead of restarting.
</fault_tolerance>

<lane_safety>
NEVER use git worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`, `git worktree add`): the operator forbids them
and they have never produced merged work here. Parallel lanes (tier 2+) share the live checkout
and are made safe by file-disjointness: each lane's `constraints.files` is disjoint from all active
lanes, and a lane stages only its own paths by name. Post-agent validation: read the lane's
checkpoint, then `git diff --name-only` over the lane's commits; every changed file MUST appear in
`constraints.files`, and an out-of-scope file means reject, revert that path, re-contract.
Work that cannot be made file-disjoint runs sequentially.
</lane_safety>

<knowledge_injection>
Inject context BEFORE spawn, never let lanes discover it at runtime: build the slice
with `agentdb inject-context <agent_type>` and inline it in the prompt (surgeon gets
gotchas + patterns + contract; adversary/reviewer get past failures + recent errors;
researcher gets domain learnings). The orchestrator owns injection. Every agent
boundary is lossy compression: structured briefing in, structured checkpoint out;
never rely on conversation history across agents.
</knowledge_injection>

<anti_patterns>
Holding context in memory instead of AgentDB · assuming a lane finished without
reading the deliverable file (receipts describe intent; files describe reality) ·
parallel lanes touching shared files (N-way merge conflicts) · serial execution when
parallel is genuinely safe · retrying without new information from the failure ·
autonomous loops without a budget cap (`max_budget_usd` on the contract) ·
accepting a lane return without the output-integrity check (placeholder degradation
is silent) · two coordinators on one repo · dispatching a review over bytes another lane
is still editing · a prompt that only makes sense inside the dispatching session.
</anti_patterns>
