# asst-watch — wake the assistant when one of its PRs finishes CI, merges or
# closes, by push, not polling: GitHub's webhook forwarder (`gh webhook forward`,
# the cli/gh-webhook extension) streams each pull_request and check_suite event
# over a websocket. Run it with the Bash tool's `run_in_background: true`; it exits
# on the first thing that happens to a listed PR, and the exit wakes the session.
#
# Usage: asst-watch <worktree> [<worktree> …]   (each on a branch with an open PR)
# Output, one line, then exit 0:  merged <owner/repo>#<n>  ·  closed <owner/repo>#<n>
#   · ci passed <owner/repo>#<n>  ·  ci failed <owner/repo>#<n>  (every check done;
#   failed = one failed or was cancelled)
# Nothing is lost to the start: a PR already merged or closed once the forwarders
# are connected is reported at once, and so is CI that was running at the start and
# is done by then. Exit 1: a forwarder could not start or stopped (its reason on
# stderr; `Hook already exists` = another forwarder holds that repo) · 2 usage.
