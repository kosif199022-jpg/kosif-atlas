# Security review report

The frame and its rules are `../../resources/report-contract.md`. Follow this shape exactly.

```markdown
## Security review · <owner/repo> · <YYYY-MM-DD>

**<Verdict: new findings at or above the threshold, or "Nothing new at <threshold> or above.">**

No cell ever holds a secret value: the kind and the location. The issues this skill opens are
findings someone works; the report links them and is not one.
