# schedule run

Open the reply with `delivery-schedule@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

The scheduler and the identity rule are in `resources/schedule-catalog-contract.md`.

## Steps

1. **Take the schedule name.** Without one, list the selection from `components.schedule` and
   ask.
2. **Resolve the local scheduler** from the live tool list, never a cloud one. None: say it is fired from the host's
   own page, and stop.
3. **Find it**: `list`, matched on `<owner>/<repo> · <title>`. Not found: say so and point at
   `delivery-schedule:init`, or `delivery-schedule:update` where `components.schedule` exists.
4. **Confirm before firing.** Show the name, the target skill, and what the run may open — a
   pull request on `schedule/<name>/`, an issue its skill opens for a finding — and wait for a yes.
   Then `run`.
5. **Report.** Wait for the run to appear in `list_runs`, `get_run_log` it where the
   scheduler has one, and report as `schedule-status` does in its step 5, with the run's
   own report quoted when it finished.

A run fired this way is the same unattended session a schedule starts. It cannot ask this
session anything, and it parks where a gate would be; a tool it has not been approved for
waits on the routine's own page.
