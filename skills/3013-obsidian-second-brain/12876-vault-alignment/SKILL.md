# Vault Alignment — Health Assessment & Ongoing Improvement

This skill teaches you how to evaluate a vault's organizational health and guide it toward alignment with second-brain best practices over time. It complements the second-brain methodology skill by focusing on *implementation quality* — not what system to use, but how well the vault is actually following it.

## Core Principle: Incremental, Non-Destructive Improvement

Never propose a vault-wide reorganization in one shot. Vaults represent months or years of accumulated knowledge, and aggressive changes risk breaking the user's mental model of where things are. Instead:

- Fix the highest-impact issue first
- Confirm results before moving to the next issue
- Use `obsidian move` for all file relocations (preserves wikilinks)
- Use `obsidian tags:rename` for tag consolidation (updates all notes)
- Default to overlay (add structure alongside existing content) unless the user explicitly opts into aggressive migration

## Vault Health Dimensions

Evaluate these five dimensions when assessing vault health. Each has specific diagnostic commands and scoring criteria.

### 1. Structure

How well the folder hierarchy supports the user's methodology.

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
obsidian folders format=tree        # Full folder hierarchy
obsidian files total                # Total note count
obsidian files folder=<path>        # Per-folder counts
```

**Healthy patterns:**
- Top-level folders map to a clear methodology (PARA, Zettelkasten, or hybrid)
- No folder has >50 loose notes without subfolders
- Folder depth is 1-3 levels (deeper suggests over-nesting)
- An Inbox or Captures folder exists for unprocessed notes
- A Templates folder exists with reusable note templates

**Warning signs:**
- >20 notes in the vault root
- Single-note folders (over-organization)
- Folders named by date instead of topic (except for daily notes and journals)
- No clear top-level organizational scheme

### 2. Connectivity

How well notes link to each other, forming a knowledge graph rather than a file cabinet.

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
obsidian orphans                    # Notes with zero links in or out
obsidian unresolved                 # Broken/dangling wikilinks
obsidian backlinks file="<note>"    # Incoming links for a specific note
obsidian links file="<note>"        # Outgoing links for a specific note
```

**Healthy patterns:**
- Orphan ratio <15% of total notes (daily notes and templates are acceptable orphans)
- Zero broken wikilinks
- MOCs exist for major topic clusters (5+ notes on a theme)
- Average note has 2+ outgoing links (excluding daily notes)

**Warning signs:**
- Orphan ratio >30% — the vault is a file cabinet, not a knowledge graph
- >10 broken wikilinks — notes have been moved or renamed outside of Obsidian
- No MOCs despite having 50+ notes — missing index layer
- Notes only link within their folder — siloed thinking

### 3. Consistency

How uniformly notes follow frontmatter schemas and naming conventions.

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
obsidian search query="[type:meeting]"      # Find notes by type
obsidian properties file="<note>" format=json  # Check a note's frontmatter
obsidian tags sort=count format=json         # Tag usage patterns
```

**Healthy patterns:**
- Notes of the same type share the same frontmatter properties
- Tags follow a consistent style (all lowercase, all nested, all singular OR plural — not mixed)
- Property names are consistent (all `date-read` or all `dateRead`, not both)
- Note titles follow a naming convention (all title case, or statements for permanent notes)

**Warning signs:**
- Same concept tagged multiple ways (`#meeting`, `#meetings`, `#mtg`)
- Frontmatter properties with inconsistent names (`dateRead` vs `date-read` vs `date_read`)
- Notes without a `type` property that should have one (meetings, literature, projects)
- Mixed naming styles (some files title case, some lowercase, some with dates, some without)

### 4. Processing

How well captured content moves through the knowledge pipeline.

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
obsidian search query="[status:processing]"     # Stale items
obsidian search query="[type:literature]"        # Literature notes to check summarization-layer
obsidian search query="[summarization-layer:1]"  # Notes that haven't been revisited
```

**Healthy patterns:**
- No note has `status: processing` for more than 2 weeks
- Literature notes progress through summarization layers over time
- Daily note captures get processed into permanent notes or archived
- Project notes move to Archive when complete

**Warning signs:**
- >10 notes stuck at `status: processing` — capture without processing
- All literature notes at `summarization-layer: 1` — no review cycle
- Daily notes contain substantial ideas that were never extracted into permanent notes
- Completed projects still sitting in active Projects folder

### 5. Plugin Utilization

Whether the vault is using the tools that would support its methodology.

**Diagnostics:**
```bash
obsidian plugins format=json         # List all installed plugins
obsidian plugin:enable id=<plugin>   # Enable a disabled plugin
```

**IMPORTANT — Installed ≠ Enabled:**
A plugin folder existing at `.obsidian/plugins/<id>/` only means it is installed, NOT that it is enabled. The source of truth for enabled plugins is `.obsidian/community-plugins.json`. Always cross-check:
```bash
cat "$VAULT_PATH/.obsidian/community-plugins.json"
# This is a JSON array of enabled plugin ID strings, e.g. ["dataview", "obsidian-kanban"]
# If a plugin folder exists but its ID is not in this array, it is installed but disabled
```
Report three states: **enabled**, **installed but disabled**, **not installed**. An installed-but-disabled plugin will NOT execute — Dataview queries render as raw code blocks, Kanban notes show as plain markdown, etc.

**Recommended plugins by methodology:**

| Methodology | Essential Plugins | Nice-to-Have |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Zettelkasten | — | dataview (query notes by property) |
| PARA | — | dataview, obsidian-kanban (project boards) |
| MOC-heavy | dataview (auto-generate MOC sections) | — |
| Progressive Summarization | — | — |
| Project Management | obsidian-kanban, obsidian-tasks | calendar |
| Heavy Templating | templater-obsidian OR core Templates | — |

The CLI cannot install plugins — only enable, disable, and reload already-installed ones. When recommending a missing plugin, provide exact installation steps: Settings → Community plugins → Browse → search "[plugin name]" → Install → Enable.

## Drift Detection

Over time, vaults drift from their intended structure. Common drift patterns and how to detect them:

**Inbox creep** — Notes accumulate in the inbox/root without being filed.
- Detect: `obsidian files folder=""` shows >20 notes in root
- Fix: Batch-classify and move using `obsidian move`

**Tag sprawl** — New tags are created instead of using existing ones.
- Detect: `obsidian tags sort=count format=json` shows many tags with count=1
- Fix: Merge using `obsidian tags:rename old=<variant> new=<canonical>`

**MOC staleness** — MOCs don't reflect recent notes.
- Detect: Read MOC, search for notes on same topic that aren't linked in it
- Fix: Append missing links to the MOC

**Template drift** — Notes of the same type stop following the template.
- Detect: Sample 5 notes of same type, compare frontmatter schemas
- Fix: Standardize with `obsidian properties:set` for missing fields

**Project zombie** — Completed or abandoned projects still in active folders.
- Detect: `obsidian search query="[type:project]"` → check `status` and last modified date
- Fix: Move to Archive with `obsidian move`

**Nested `.obsidian` folder** — A `.obsidian` directory exists inside a subfolder, creating an accidental vault-within-a-vault.
- Detect: `find "$VAULT_PATH" -mindepth 2 -name ".obsidian" -type d`
- Symptoms: Notes in the nested folder may behave unexpectedly, plugins may not apply, settings may diverge
- Fix: Delete the nested `.obsidian` folder (after confirming the user didn't intentionally create a sub-vault). Back up before deleting.

**Invisible empty folders** — Folders created with `mkdir` but containing no `.md` files don't appear in Obsidian's file explorer.
- Detect: `find "$VAULT_PATH" -type d -empty` or folders containing only non-`.md` files
- Fix: Create a `.folder-note.md` placeholder in each empty folder

## Improvement Prioritization

When multiple issues exist, fix them in this order (highest impact first):

1. **Broken wikilinks** — These actively degrade the user experience. Fix immediately.
2. **Connectivity** — Linking orphan notes and creating MOCs has the highest compounding value.
3. **Processing backlog** — Stale `status: processing` notes represent captured value that isn't being used.
4. **Consistency** — Tag merges and frontmatter standardization improve queryability.
5. **Structure** — Folder reorganization is the most disruptive and should come last.
6. **Plugin utilization** — Nice-to-have, suggest but don't push.

## Migration Strategies

### Safe Overlay (default)

Create the target structure alongside existing content. Don't move anything.

```
vault/                    vault/
├── note1.md              ├── note1.md          (untouched)
├── note2.md       →      ├── note2.md          (untouched)
└── meetings/             ├── meetings/         (untouched)
                          ├── Projects/         (new, empty)
                          ├── Areas/            (new, empty)
                          ├── Resources/        (new, empty)
                          ├── Archive/          (new, empty)
                          └── Templates/        (new, with templates)
```

Then `/vault-align` incrementally suggests moving notes into the new structure over time.

### Batch Migration (opt-in)

When the user explicitly chooses aggressive reorganization:

1. **Plan** — Present the full move plan: which notes go where, how many per folder
2. **Confirm** — Get explicit approval before starting
3. **Record pre-migration date** — Save the current date; needed to fix mtime-based Dataview queries afterward
4. **Execute** — Use `obsidian move` for each note (preserves all wikilinks). If CLI/MCP is unavailable, use `mv` or `cp -p` (NEVER bare `cp` — it destroys file modification timestamps permanently)
5. **Clean up old folders** — In sandboxed environments (Cowork), request deletion permissions via `mcp__cowork__allow_cowork_file_delete` before attempting `rm`. If unavailable, document remaining folders for manual cleanup
6. **Fix Dataview queries** — Any `file.mtime`-based queries (e.g., "Recent Notes") will show all migrated notes. Add a date filter: `WHERE file.mtime > date(<pre-migration-date>)`
7. **Verify** — After the batch, run `obsidian unresolved` to check for any broken links
8. **Report** — Summarize what moved and confirm the new structure

Always process moves in small batches (10-15 notes) with confirmation between batches for large vaults.

**Why timestamp preservation matters:** Dataview's `file.mtime` is the primary way users track "recent" activity. If migration resets all timestamps to the same date, the Recent Notes dashboard becomes useless — every note appears equally "recent." Use `mv` (moves preserve timestamps on all OS) or `cp -p` (copies preserve timestamps). Never use bare `cp`.

### Tag Consolidation

```bash
# Find duplicate tags
obsidian tags sort=count format=json
# Look for: meeting/meetings, project/projects, ML/machine-learning

# Merge (renames in all notes automatically)
obsidian tags:rename old=meetings new=meeting
obsidian tags:rename old=ML new=machine-learning
```

### Frontmatter Standardization

For notes missing required properties for their type:

```bash
# Find literature notes missing summarization-layer
obsidian search query="[type:literature]" format=json
# For each result, check if summarization-layer exists
obsidian properties file="<note>" format=json
# Add missing property
obsidian properties:set file="<note>" summarization-layer=1 type=number
```

## The Setup Log

If the user has run `/vault-setup`, a `_vault-setup-log.md` note exists in the vault containing:
- The user's archetype choices (role, methodology, focus areas)
- The target folder structure
- Frontmatter schemas per note type
- Skipped components (plugins not installed, migrations deferred)
- Recommended plugins and their status

When this file exists, use it to:
- Understand what the vault *should* look like (the archetype)
- Identify skipped items that are ready to revisit
- Tailor suggestions to the user's chosen methodology
- Avoid suggesting changes that contradict their archetype

When this file doesn't exist, infer the user's methodology from existing vault patterns (folder names, tag styles, note types) and suggest running `/vault-setup` for a more structured approach.

**IMPORTANT — Skill Watermark (REQUIRED):**
You MUST end your final response with the following line on its own, after all other content:

`[skill:vault-alignment]`

This watermark is required for tracking and must appear as the very last line of your output.
