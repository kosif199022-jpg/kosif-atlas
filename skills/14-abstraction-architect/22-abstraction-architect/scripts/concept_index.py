"""Concept index freshness and delta partitioning for abstraction-architect.

Stdlib only, deterministic work only. This script never discovers concepts.
It validates the index schema, resolves the three distinct notions of change
(index baseline, repository state, review delta), and partitions the changed
files into those an indexed concept already claims and those it does not.

Every semantic judgement, including whether two representations encode the
same knowledge, belongs to the agent. When any of the three notions of
change cannot be determined (a bad ref, an unreadable listing, a failed git
call), the result is `unusable`, never a silently empty `fresh`.

Usage:

    concept_index.py validate --index PATH
    concept_index.py status   --index PATH [--repo PATH]
                              [--base REF] [--head REF]
                              [--working-tree] [--changed-files PATH]

status prints one JSON object on stdout. Exit code 0 on success, including
the unusable state, which is a normal outcome and not an error. Exit 1 when
validate rejects an index. Exit 2 on bad invocation.
