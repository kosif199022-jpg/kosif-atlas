# Resuming

A by-hand checklist is rarely run in one sitting. The person runs two steps, reports them in a sentence, stops, and comes back later, perhaps after another commit or from another worktree. The fosforo sessions show what happens without a record: "List the verification steps here please", "Please reprint the verification steps", and "What's needed for host verification?" each rebuilt the list from scratch, and every result already reported against the earlier list had to be carried across by memory or was lost.

The record is what makes the second request cheap and keeps the results. This file covers where it lives, how to reprint from it, how to write results into it, and how to split and close it.

## Where the Record Lives

**In the plan, when the work has one.** A `## Manual verification` section in the plan under `docs/plans/todo/`. It travels with the branch, it is reviewed with the change, and its `### Exclusive resources` heading is where resource-claim and work-suggestion skills already look. fosforo's plans hold their host passes this way, with sections such as "What the host settled, arms 1 and 2" written into the plan beside the steps that produced them.

**On the issue, when there is no plan or the project does not commit plans.** One checklist comment, updated in place for the life of the checklist.

The first line of an issue-backed checklist is the stable marker `<!-- manual-verification: OWNER/REPO#NUMBER -->`, with the actual repository and issue number substituted. To find an existing record, search every issue comment page for that exact marker:

```bash
gh api --paginate repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --jq '.[] | select((.body | split("\n")[0] == "<!-- manual-verification: OWNER/REPO#NUMBER -->") or (.body | contains("## Manual verification"))) | {id, body}'
```

Use the plan record without querying GitHub when one exists. With no plan, one comment containing the exact marker is the issue record. If one unmarked comment contains `## Manual verification`, ask the person to identify it and add the marker before continuing. No candidate comments means the checklist may be created. Multiple candidates require asking which comment to keep before editing anything.

**For a phase gate that spans several issues**, in the build plan's section for that phase, with each step linking the issue whose work it verifies.

**Never:**

- A new comment or a new file per session. Two copies drift, and the second one does not have the first one's results.
- Scrollback, or a scratchpad file. Both end with the session.
- A gitignored working directory. fosforo keeps captures in a gitignored `verification/` directory, and its build plan is explicit that whatever is there is one session's working artifacts. Captures can live there; readings go in the record.

### Writing to an issue comment

Write the body to a temporary file first, using the tmpfile pattern from the `use-git` skill, rather than passing a long body inline. Generate a path:

```bash
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/manual-verification-body-XXXXXX"
```

Set `body_file` to that returned path and write the complete checklist there with the Write tool. Wait for the write to succeed before issuing a separate GitHub CLI call. Replace `NUMBER`, `OWNER/REPO`, and `COMMENT_ID` in the commands with the issue and comment being maintained.

Create the comment once. `gh` prints the comment's URL, which ends in `#issuecomment-` and the comment's numeric ID:

```bash
gh issue comment NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --body-file "${body_file}"
```

The first line of `body_file` must be the stable marker for this issue: `<!-- manual-verification: OWNER/REPO#NUMBER -->`.

Only after creation succeeds and returns a URL, read that exact comment back using the numeric ID from its `#issuecomment-` fragment:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/comments/COMMENT_ID --jq .body
```

Verify that the stored body is non-empty and contains the intended checklist, including its headings, status table, steps, and existing readings. A returned URL alone does not establish that the body was saved. If it is empty or incomplete, rewrite the tmpfile and use the update command below to repair the same comment, then read it back again. Do not create a second comment to recover. If creation fails without returning an ID, report the failure and do not reuse an ID from another run.

Once the body is verified, put the returned URL on the checklist's `Record:` line, update that same comment, and verify the saved body again. Only then present it as the checklist record.

Serialize updates to an issue-backed checklist. Only one session may edit a given checklist at a time. Before starting the read-merge-write-verify sequence, confirm that no other session is editing it, and ask the person not to edit it during that sequence. If another update is in progress, wait for it to finish and verify before starting.

Before every update, read the current body back. The person may have edited the comment on GitHub, typing results straight into it, and an update written from a stale copy would erase them:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/comments/COMMENT_ID --jq .body
```

Merge the new results into what came back, then write it:

```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/comments/COMMENT_ID -F body=@"${body_file}"
```

Read the body back after each update and verify the intended content. Keep the tmpfile until verification or recovery is complete; on an unrecoverable failure, preserve the intended body in the session output and report that persistence is incomplete. Clean up in a separate call, skipping removal if a failed Write left the generated path unoccupied:

```bash
if [[ -e "${body_file}" ]]; then
  rm "${body_file}"
fi
```

Do not use `gh issue comment --edit-last`. It edits the authenticated user's most recent comment on the issue, which stops being the checklist the moment that user comments on the issue about anything else. Pass `--repo` explicitly: inside a fork with an `upstream` remote, `gh` can resolve the repository to the upstream.

## Reprinting

A request to list, reprint, or walk through the steps is a request to read the record.

1. **Write before reading.** If the conversation holds results that are not yet in the record, write them in first.
1. **Check for staleness.** Compare the build named in the most recent results with the current tree. A step whose Expected depends on code changed since then is marked for re-running before it is shown; see [When the Build Changes](#when-the-build-changes).
1. **Lead with the status table**, so the person sees what is done before what is left.
1. **Print the remaining steps in full**, grouped by exclusive resource, with step 0 first because it is re-run every session.
1. **Summarize finished steps by their reading**, not by repeating the whole step, unless the person asks for them.

If the reprint was asked for because a step was unclear, the fix goes into the record before the reprint, not into the reprint alone. Otherwise the next reprint brings the unclear wording back.

## Parsing Free-Text Results

Results arrive as a sentence against step numbers. Take this one:

> 4's confirmed, skipping 5 and 6, 7 gave 1.0894

| Fragment           | Step | Status                                                                                                                   | Recorded                                   |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| "4's confirmed"    | 4    | `passed` only if the report affirms both Expected and Null vs broken, with step 0 confirmed; otherwise `pending` and ask | "confirmed", verbatim                      |
| "skipping 5 and 6" | 5, 6 | `pending` until the reason and destination are recorded, then `deferred`                                                 | Ask once if either cannot be inferred      |
| "7 gave 1.0894"    | 7    | Compare with Expected and tolerance only after step 0 and Null vs broken hold; otherwise ask or mark `void`              | "1.0894", verbatim, against the prediction |

The rules behind that table:

- **Record verbatim, then derive the status.** The person's words and numbers go into the Result line as given. The status is a judgment made from them, and it can be revisited; the reading cannot be recovered if it was paraphrased.
- **Do not mark a step `deferred` until its record names both why it is deferred and where it will be completed.** Until both are recorded, leave it `pending` and ask once for the missing information.
- **Attach date, build, and environment to every result.** The build comes from this session's step 0. If step 0 has not been run this session, record the reading, ask for step 0 now, and let the reading stand only if step 0 confirms the build and nothing was installed in between. Otherwise the reading is `void`.
- **Require the build and control evidence before assigning `passed` or `failed`.** Both the Expected observation and the step's Null vs broken evidence must come from the reported run, with step 0 confirmed for that session. If evidence is merely unreported, keep the result `pending` (or `partial` for an incomplete set of readings) and ask for it. If the build or instrument was wrong, the control was skipped, or conditions could not expose the defect, record `void` and what a valid rerun needs.
- **Check each number against its tolerance, not against the printed prediction.** Once the build and control evidence hold, +1.0893 against a predicted +1.0889 with a tolerance of ±0.002 is a pass, and the record keeps both numbers.
- **Ask about everything unsettled in one message**, one precise question per step, so the person answers once.
- **A step number that does not exist, or a result that fits a different step better, is a question, not a guess.**

## Reports That Do Not Settle a Step

Some reports are real results that still do not decide the step. Each has a fixed response.

**"Seems fine."** fosforo received "4: Seems fine." for a step that asked the person to open two instances' editors at once and gave no Expected at all, so "seems fine" was the most the step allowed. Where Expected is an observation in words, record `passed` only if the report affirms that observation and the same-run Null vs broken evidence, with step 0 confirmed. Keep the words verbatim. If the number or control evidence is unreported, keep the step `pending` or `partial` and ask for what is missing. If the instrument did not run or the control was skipped, the result is `void`, even for a qualitative Expected.

**"Nothing happened (as desired)."** Ask whether the step's null-vs-broken evidence was seen: the liveness marker, the positive control, the stressing condition. If it was, record `passed` with both the absence and the evidence. If the step had no such evidence, or the person did not see it, record what they observed, set the status to `void`, and write what would confirm it, which is usually a marker to add. `./null-vs-broken.md` has the techniques.

**"I'm not sure what I'm looking for."** The step is defective, not the person. Rewrite its Expected in the record, then answer by pointing at the rewritten step. Re-read anything already reported against the old wording under the new Expected: fosforo's heap counts, from two samples taken with REAPER's interface in different states, could not be read under any wording, so they are `void`, and the rewritten protocol is what ran next.

**A reading outside tolerance.** Record the reading first, then check that step 0 and the step's Null vs broken evidence held. Assign `failed` only when those prerequisites are confirmed; keep it `pending` while their evidence is missing, or `void` when the wrong build, a broken instrument, or ineffective conditions invalidate the run. fosforo's screenshot tool reported a sine at +0.5000 as +0.0359, which reads as silence, because it took a centroid over a whole column and so averaged the persistence trail rather than the beam. The defect was in the instrument, and the reading was what found it.

**A reading that shows the prediction was wrong while the code was right.** Keep both numbers, correct the Expected in place, and say the reading corrected it. fosforo's beam-as-quads plan has a section called "Three predictions in this plan were wrong", and that section is worth more than the predictions were.

## When the Build Changes

Every result is tied to the build it was measured on. When a session resumes on a different build:

1. Step 0 names the new build.
1. For each step with prior readings, including `passed`, `partial`, and `failed` steps, check whether the changes between its build and the new one touch what the step covers, for example with `git diff --stat OLD..NEW -- PATHS`, where `PATHS` are the files the step exercises.
1. If they do, set the step back to `pending`, keep the earlier Result line as history, and add why: "passed on `OLD`; re-run, since `NEW` changed the clamp".
1. If they do not, the result stands, and the record says it was carried forward and why.

Do not mix readings from two builds in one multi-reading step without saying which reading came from which build.

## Deferring

A deferral is a decision, and it belongs on the record with its reasons. After "That's a lot of testing. Let's save it for later in the phases. I did check 1 and 2", the fosforo plan recorded a section titled "What was run in REAPER, and what was deliberately deferred". It named the build the run used, "the Debug build at `bbeab3c26442`, hash-confirmed against `zig-out`", then described what the two checks covered, then gave a table of what was deferred and what each item would cover:

| Deferred                                 | What it would cover                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 32- or 64-frame blocks, and 96 kHz       | The `reset` memset against the tightest deadline and at double the size |
| Ten or more device changes, watching RSS | `activate`/`deactivate` on `c_allocator`, which no test reaches         |
| A `--release=fast` pass                  | The build that ships, where every assertion above is gone               |

Those are three of its six rows. The introduction to the table explains why deferring was sound: "None of it guards a risk this issue introduces on its own, which is why it can wait, but the list should not evaporate."

For every deferred step, record:

- **The risk it covers**, so the deferral can be judged later.
- **Its destination:** a named later phase in a plan, or an issue, filed now or linked if it exists. A deferral without a destination is an omission with a label on it.
- **Why it can wait**, when the answer is not obvious from the risk.

## Splitting Across Sessions

The `### Exclusive resources` heading is what lets a checklist split without invalidating itself.

- **Split by resource.** One session takes all the steps for one resource. Steps that need no exclusive resource can run in any session, including while another worktree holds the resource.
- **Run step 0 in every session.** Each session's results carry its own build.
- **Claim the resource where the project records claims.** When worktrees claim resources, as the `create-worktree` skill's `--resource` option does, the session that holds the claim is the one that runs that resource's steps.
- **Write results before a session ends.** The status table is the handoff, and a session that ends with results only in its scrollback has handed off nothing.

## Closing

A checklist is closed when every row of its status table is terminal: `passed`; `failed` with a fix or an issue; `deferred` with a destination; `untestable here` with a reason; or `retired` with where its quantity is verified instead. `pending`, `partial`, and `void` rows are run again or deferred, never dropped.

Leave the record in place. Later corrections get checked against its figures: fosforo's verification runs are quoted with their numbers in its issues, and those numbers are what a later fix is measured against. Where the checklist gates a pull request or an issue, summarize the closed status table there and link the record.
