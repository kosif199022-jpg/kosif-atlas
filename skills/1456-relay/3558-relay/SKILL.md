# Relay Skill

Wraps the local `codex`, `opencode`, and `claude` CLIs to delegate tasks across harnesses. All output is reported in zh-TW.

```
/relay:relay <codex|opencode|claude> delegate <task>
/relay:relay <codex|opencode|claude> review [task]
/relay:relay codex image [prompt] [--out <path>]
```

**Choosing between modes:**

- **`delegate`** — ask a backend to *do* something (implement, refactor, debug). Code changes expected.
- **`review`** — ask a backend for analysis. Output is critique + suggestions. No code changes.
- **`image`** — generate an image (codex only, via its built-in imagegen skill).

If the user says "review", "看看", "檢查", "找問題" → use `review`.
If the user says "幫我做", "實作", "重構", "想個辦法" → use `delegate`.
If the user says "生圖", "畫圖", "Generate image" → use `image` (codex only).

## Running the relay script

Every command below runs the bundled `scripts/relay.ts`.

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is Claude Code's official plugin-root variable. Inside an agent Bash call it is **not reliably set**. Under Codex it is empty. Under OpenCode it is also empty. Do not depend on it.

Do not use a repo-relative path such as `packages/relay/...`. That path exists only inside the source repo.

Resolve the script from the **"Base directory for this skill"** banner. Claude Code prints this banner when the skill loads:

```bash
# Substitute the real banner path for <BANNER_PATH>
SKILL_DIR="<BANNER_PATH>"            # e.g. ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../skills/relay
RELAY="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/relay.ts"
test -f "$RELAY" || { echo "relay.ts not found at $RELAY" >&2; exit 1; }
```

> **OpenCode only**: there is no banner and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty. Use
> `RELAY=~/.config/opencode/skills/relay/scripts/relay.ts` instead.

For brevity, the examples below write `relay.ts <backend> <mode> …` as shorthand for `bun "$RELAY" <backend> <mode> …`. Run it from the user's current project directory. `relay.ts` invokes the backend CLIs against that working tree's git context.

## Live-pane mode (inside herdr)

Inside herdr (`HERDR_ENV=1`), `delegate` and `review` auto-route to a live TUI pane in a new tab.
Before running in that environment, read `references/live.md`.
It covers flags (`--headless` / `--keep-pane` / `--wait-timeout` / `--dangerous` / `--no-ask`), stdout/stderr output contract, pane lifecycle, and pending-report semantics.
`image` stays headless/native.

**`--no-ask` is for callers with nobody at the pane.** A live TUI hands the agent an ask tool the headless form never gets, and relay reads the result file rather than the pane, so a question stops the run against a clock nobody is watching. The flag appends an unattended contract to the prompt file. Leave it off when you are sitting there: answering a good question beats guessing.

**Keep the default live.** `--headless` needs a real reason.

If a run comes back with a **pending report**, the delegate is still working — that is not a failure. Reattach with `relay.ts collect --agent <name> --result <path>`, repeating as needed; the report prints the filled-in command. See `references/live.md`.

Editing capability is identical: same CLI, model, and write access. So "more precise" or "deterministic" is never a valid reason. Override only for nested delegation, no live seam, or no pane surface.

`relay.ts` is one blocking call. Do not poll it while it runs. See `references/live.md`.

## Config check (opencode delegate or review)

Run this before step 1 of `delegate` and before `review`, for the `opencode` backend only. The suggested config covers only opencode, so a codex or claude run skips this section.
In a non-interactive context (a sub-agent or headless caller), skip the questions below and run relay with the config as it is.

1. Run `opencode --version` first. On `2.` or later, tell the user relay supports opencode 1.x only and suggest downgrading to 1.x. Stop.
2. Run `relay.ts config check`. It prints a JSON report; branch on its exit code.
3. On exit `4` (`malformed`), report `path` and `error` to the user. Stop. Do not offer an update or ask for a model.
4. On exit `3` (`missing`, `no-version`, or `outdated`), show the user `suggested.models` beside their `models` and `version`.
   - Ask with the harness's question tool. Offer: Merge (keep models the user chose, refresh the ones an earlier apply wrote, fill the missing ones), Overwrite (replace with the suggested models), Skip this time.
   - For `missing`, merge and overwrite write the same file, so offer only Apply and Skip this time.
   - Apply the answer with `relay.ts config apply --merge` or `relay.ts config apply --overwrite`.
5. On exit `0` (`current`), continue.

### Model pick

Run this after the config check when the user passed no `--model` and `models.opencode.<mode>` is absent. Re-run `config check` after an apply to read the updated `models`.

1. Run `opencode models`. Keep the ids from `suggested.models.opencode.<mode>` and `suggested.suggestions.opencode.<mode>` that appear in its output.
2. Ask with the harness's question tool. Offer up to 3 surviving ids, plus opencode defaults.
3. Save a picked id with `relay.ts config set-model opencode <mode> "<id>"`.
4. Save opencode defaults with `relay.ts config set-model opencode <mode> cli-default`. Relay then omits `-m`, and the question does not return.
5. Run relay without `--model`. It reads the saved choice.

## `/relay:relay <backend> delegate <task>`

For non-review tasks: implementing features, refactoring, suggesting an approach, debugging.

1. Identify relevant files from the task context. If it is unclear, ask the user.
   - Prefer `git diff --name-only`, `git status --short`, and `rg --files` to discover candidate files.
   - If the target files or ownership boundaries are unclear, ask before delegating.

2. Run relay in a single step:

   ```bash
   relay.ts <backend> delegate --task "<task>" --files <file1,file2,...>
   ```

   where `<backend>` ∈ `{codex, opencode, claude}`.

   Examples:
   ```bash
   relay.ts codex delegate --task "add error handling to api.ts" --files api.ts
   relay.ts opencode delegate --task "refactor the auth flow" --files auth.ts,middleware.ts
   relay.ts claude delegate --task "implement the feature" --files main.ts
   ```

3. Inspect the backend's result. Run available verification (lint, types, tests). Then write the report.

   Apply additional local fixes only when they are required to complete the delegated task. Keep the fixes inside the agreed scope.

## `/relay:relay <backend> review [task]`

Review is report-only. Unless the user asks separately, do not apply changes from review output.

- No task: run `relay.ts <backend> review`. Relay reviews only uncommitted changes.
- Task present: pass it unchanged as positional text. Do not translate it into `--files` or any other flag.

```bash
relay.ts codex review
relay.ts opencode review "Review auth.ts for race conditions"
relay.ts claude review "Review changes since main"
```

---

## `/relay:relay codex image [prompt] [--out <path>]`

Generate an image via codex, which uses its built-in imagegen skill. **Image mode is codex-only.**

If **prompt** is missing, ask the user:

```
AskUserQuestion("要生什麼圖？")
```

If **--out** is missing, ask the user (offer default: `./generated/image.png`).

In non-interactive contexts (invoked by a sub-agent or headless), do not block on AskUserQuestion. Fail fast with a clear message naming the missing argument.

Once both are known, run:

```bash
relay.ts codex image "<prompt>" --out <path>
```

The script auto-adds a timestamp suffix to the filename, for example `./foo.png` → `./foo_20260430-1708.png`. It returns the final path.

Report the final saved path. If the user wants a different name, use a non-destructive rename command.

---

## Smart Apply Policy

Evaluate each backend suggestion and act:

**Auto-apply** (for delegate only):
- The backend provided a concrete diff or exact file/line edit
- The change is inside the selected scope
- The current agent can run verification afterward

In delegate mode, backends are write-capable. They may have already edited the working tree. This apply policy governs suggestions in the report. Already-applied changes are verified and reported under 已套用變更.

After applying, run any available verification (lint / type check / tests) via Bash.

If verification fails, undo only your own attempted edit. Move the suggestion to "report only."

**Report only** (for review, or when uncertain):
- Architectural changes
- Logic changes affecting behavior
- Multi-file / interconnected changes
- Deletions of existing code
- Changes outside the selected scope
- Anything you're not 100% confident about

---

## Model Save-to-Config Flow

When the user passes an explicit `--model` flag:

1. Run relay with the specified model:
   ```bash
   relay.ts <backend> <mode> --model "<provider/model>" ...
   ```

2. After a successful run, ask via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   AskUserQuestion("儲存 <model> 作為 <backend> <mode> 的預設值嗎？")
   ```

3. If the user approves, save it through the relay config command:
   ```bash
   relay.ts config set-model <backend> <mode> "<provider/model>"
   ```

Config file location: `~/.config/q-lab/cc-plugins/relay/config.json`.

Model precedence is `--model` flag, then this config, then the backend CLI's own default. The value `cli-default` in either place omits the model flag. A malformed config file fails the run with `Could not read relay config`. Report that file to the user. Do not ask for a model.

---

## Failure Handling

If the script exits non-zero, report the failure in zh-TW. Then stop. Do not guess or fabricate suggestions.

Exception: a live-mode **pending report** exits 0 by design. See `references/live.md`.

Include:

- Command intent
- Exit code if available
- Relevant stderr summary
- Suggested next step

Capability gates (e.g., `/relay:relay opencode image` → unsupported) fail fast with a clear error message before any CLI runs.

**Never call a backend CLI directly to work around a relay failure.** Do not use `codex exec`, `opencode run`, or `claude -p`.

Every delegation goes through `relay.ts`. It owns the prompt contract, herdr live-pane routing, and the result-file protocol. A hand-rolled headless call silently discards all three.

If `relay.ts` cannot run, report that and stop.

## Additional Resources

- **`references/backends.md`** — read this only when installing under OpenCode or debugging a backend CLI failure. `relay.ts` already encodes all CLI invocations. Normal runs never need it.
- **`references/live.md`** — read this only when `HERDR_ENV=1`. It covers live-pane flags, output contract, pane lifecycle, and pending-report semantics.
