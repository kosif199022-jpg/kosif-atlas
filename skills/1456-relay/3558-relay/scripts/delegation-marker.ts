/**
 * delegation-marker — WRITE half of the cross-plugin delegation contract.
 *
 * relay already sets `RELAY_DELEGATED=1` on every delegate it spawns, and that
 * is enough everywhere except one path: codex's INTERACTIVE TUI hands its
 * session to a shared `codex app-server daemon` whose environment is captured
 * once at daemon start. A var set on the pane reaches the codex process but
 * never the hook, so monitor's decision-log hooks fire inside a delegate nobody
 * is watching. (`codex exec` is unaffected — it runs the session in-process and
 * does see the var, which is why the headless path needs nothing here.)
 *
 * So the live-codex path drops a file the hook can find. The reader lives in
 * monitor — `packages/monitor/cockpit-rs/src/hook/delegation_marker.rs` —
 * and the two plugins version independently, so they share a PATH AND A SHAPE,
 * never code. Change either side and you must change the other:
 *
 *   ~/.local/share/q-lab/delegation/<startedAt>-<rand>.json
 *   { cwd, backend, startedAt, armUntil, expiresAt, sessionIds: [] }
 *
 * `armUntil` is the window in which the reader may match on cwd alone, before
 * it has any session id to key on. `expiresAt` is the whole marker's TTL, which
 * has to outlive the delegate: relay may exit while the pane is still working
 * (a `pending` live result), and a marker deleted then would un-silence a
 * delegate mid-flight.
