# Session Stats

When this skill is invoked, do not add a preamble or narrate the plan. Run the relevant script directly, then return only the formatted result or the shortest actionable message.

Resolve `PLUGIN_ROOT` from the selected skill's absolute path: it is the session-manager directory containing `skills/` and `scripts/`. Never hard-code a marketplace cache version.

Run one of (the optional argument is a substring filter limiting output to matching projects, e.g. `ProjectA`):

```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/session-stats.sh"
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/session-stats.sh" "<project-filter>"
```

The output has three sections; present them as:

1. Per-project rows (already sorted by last active):

   ```text
   | Project | Sessions | Size | Last Active |
   ```

2. The `TOTALS` line as one summary sentence (projects, sessions, total size).

3. The `TOP 5 LARGEST SESSIONS` section:

   ```text
   | Size | Project | Name |
   ```

The command is read-only. Projects are grouped by canonical session cwd. Native
metadata supplies names when present; filesystem compatibility uses the latest
indexed name. Missing names display as `(untitled)`. Relay backend diagnostics.
Size describes known physical files; `+ unknown` means some logical sessions
have no known file size. Do not describe that as a complete storage total.
`--json` includes row provenance and nullable byte sizes; `--archived` includes
archives. Suggest `$session-manager:session-list` to inspect a project and the
separate `$session-manager:session-delete` workflow for cleanup.
