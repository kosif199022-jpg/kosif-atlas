# Session Search

When this skill is invoked, do not add a preamble or narrate the plan. Run the relevant script directly, then return only the formatted result or the shortest actionable message.

Resolve `PLUGIN_ROOT` from the selected skill's absolute path: it is the session-manager directory containing `skills/` and `scripts/`. Never hard-code a marketplace cache version.

If no query is provided, tell the user:

```text
Usage: $session-manager:session-search <query>
```

Run:

```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search-sessions.sh" "<query>"
```

Present tab-separated output as:

```text
| Thread | Session ID | Project | Size | Last Modified |
```
