# Run this from a context that did NOT do the work: a fresh subagent, a fresh

# diff — never the build transcript.
#
# It refuses to grade a run that was never ratified, fails the run outright if
# either pinned artifact drifted, runs the pinned verifier itself, and accepts
# a PASS only when the harness wrote evidence for it during THIS run.
#
# Exit: 0 all checkable criteria green and proven; 1 a criterion is not green,
# or drift/evidence rejection fails the run; 2 usage / unpinned / missing run.
#
# RG_TEST_DROP_EVIDENCE=1 deletes evidence after the verifier runs — the
# negative control that proves the freshness gate can actually fail.
