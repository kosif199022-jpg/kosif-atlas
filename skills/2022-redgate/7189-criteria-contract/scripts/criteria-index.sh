# criteria-index.sh — build (or verify) .redgate/INDEX.md, the verifier corpus
# index.

# Build:  criteria-index.sh [--root DIR]
# Check:  criteria-index.sh --check [--root DIR]
#
# Verifiers are the most expensive artifact a Red Gate run produces and the
# only one that resets to zero each run (gap #10, docs/research/gap-analysis.md).
# This script reads every run under .redgate/<slug>/ and writes one table row
# per criterion — run, number, status, layers, statement — so the next ARM can
# reuse a check shape that already survived instead of re-inventing it. The
# index is a POINTER CATALOG: the reusable check_cmd itself stays in the run's
# pinned CRITERIA.md, which this script never touches (read-only over runs; the
# only file it writes is .redgate/INDEX.md, outside every run dir, so the
# ratified-contract guard is never in play).
#
# Status column:
#   checkable — the criterion carries a check_cmd
#   witness   — declared WITNESS/UNVERIFIABLE (human observation, not reusable
#               as a mechanical shape)
#   demoted   — the run's gates.log records mutation control demoting this
#               criterion (it stayed green when its subject was reverted:
#               WITNESS-in-fact). NEVER reuse a demoted shape as a positive
#               control — it is in the index precisely as a warning.
#
# Output is deterministic (runs sorted by slug, criteria by number), so the
# committed INDEX.md is verifiable: --check rebuilds to a temp file and diffs,
# exiting 1 on drift — the same sync contract the example gallery uses.
#
# Exit: 0 built (or in sync); 1 --check drift; 2 usage.
