# re-hashes both, and a mismatch fails the run as drift.

# The disposition field records what the human actually did at the gate —

# approved / revised / declined (MAJOR) — so the approval-fatigue report
# (recurrence-detector's gate-report.sh) can tell a calibrated mandate from
# rubber-stamping. The lesson field is mandatory at every gate (one line;
# the reflection the protocol keeps between rounds, not inside them); after
# a red verdict it names what the next contract must encode. An auto-pass
# that cannot cite its qualifying conditions is a protocol violation; MAJOR
# decisions record the human's answer, never a default.
