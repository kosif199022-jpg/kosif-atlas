  X-ray method: mechanical structure extraction fused with semantic reading into a ground-truth account of WHAT, WHY, HOW and CONSEQUENCES. Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, PL/SQL, Rust, CSS/SCSS/LESS.
  TRIGGER WHEN: encountering an unfamiliar codebase, needing pre-review technical context, before a major refactor, or when documentation is stale or missing.
  DO NOT TRIGGER WHEN: the user wants human-readable narrative docs (use /codebase-mapper:map-codebase), a public-facing README, or a review verdict (senior-review consumes this output instead).

# Codebase X-Ray Analysis Skill

## Overview

This skill combines **mechanical structure extraction** with **Claude's semantic understanding** to produce comprehensive codebase documentation. Unlike simple AST parsing, this skill captures:

- **WHAT** the code does (structure, functions, classes)
- **WHY** it exists (business purpose, design decisions)
- **HOW** it integrates (dependencies, contracts, flows)
- **CONSEQUENCES** of changes (side effects, failure modes)

## Language Support

| Language | Extensions | Structural extraction | Comment rewriting |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | `.py`, `.pyi` | stdlib `ast` (always available) | `#` line + docstrings |
| Java | `.java` | tree-sitter (preferred) or regex | `//`, `/* */`, Javadoc `/** */` |
| JavaScript | `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.jsx` | tree-sitter (preferred) or regex | `//`, `/* */`, JSDoc `/** */` |
| TypeScript | `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, `.cts` | tree-sitter (preferred) or regex; adds interfaces, enums, type aliases | `//`, `/* */`, JSDoc `/** */` |
| SQL | `.sql`, `.ddl`, `.dml` | regex DDL (tables, views, indexes, sequences, types, functions, procedures, triggers) | `--`, `/* */` |
| PL/SQL (Oracle) | `.pks`, `.pkb`, `.plsql`, `.pls`, `.pck`, `.prc`, `.fnc`, `.trg` | regex (packages, package bodies, type bodies, cursors, exceptions, %TYPE/%ROWTYPE references) | `--`, `/* */` |
| Rust | `.rs` | tree-sitter (preferred) or regex; structs, enums, traits, impls (with `Trait for Type` naming), mods, unions, type aliases | `//`, `/* */`, rustdoc `///` / `//!` / `/** */` / `/*! */` |
| CSS, SCSS, LESS | `.css`, `.scss`, `.less` | stdlib tokenizer, never tree-sitter: one symbol per applied rule, named by its flattened selector inside its enclosing at-rules; top-level at-rules and Sass or LESS variables; mixins and Sass functions; `@import` / `@use` / `@forward`; Tailwind `@apply` layout utilities read as the declarations they inline | `/* */`, and `//` outside plain CSS |

`.sql` files are disambiguated against PL/SQL by inspecting content for Oracle-specific markers (`CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE`, `DBMS_OUTPUT`, `%TYPE`, `%ROWTYPE`, `UTL_FILE`, `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS`, etc.). PostgreSQL `plpgsql` is correctly classified as SQL.

## Prerequisites

The scripts require Python >= 3.10 and work **out of the box** with just the stdlib. Tree-sitter is optional and improves accuracy for Java / JavaScript / TypeScript / Rust:

```bash
# Optional: install for higher-fidelity parsing
pip install -r "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/requirements.txt"
# or
uv pip install -r "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/requirements.txt"
```

What changes when tree-sitter is installed:

- **Java**: nested classes, generic type parameters, annotations, multi-line declarations parsed correctly. Without it, the regex fallback still finds top-level classes, methods, imports, and constants.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: arrow functions in object/class properties, decorators, template literals, JSX elements parsed correctly. Without it, the regex fallback handles top-level declarations, ES6 `import`/`export`, and CommonJS `require`.
- **Rust**: lifetimes, generic bounds (`where` clauses), impl blocks with trait bounds, attribute macros parsed correctly. Without it, the regex fallback still finds top-level fns, structs/enums/traits/impls/mods, use declarations, and UPPER_CASE constants.
- **Python / SQL / PL-SQL / CSS**: no change. Python always uses stdlib `ast`; SQL/PL-SQL always use the regex DDL extractor; CSS, SCSS and LESS always use the stylesheet tokenizer.

The active parser is reported in `ParseResult.notes` and in the CLI output: `parser=stdlib-ast`, `parser=tree-sitter`, `parser=regex-fallback`, or `parser=stylesheet`.

### Capabilities

**Mechanical Analysis (Scripts):**
- Extract code structure (classes, functions, imports)
- Map dependencies (internal/external)
- Find symbol usages across the codebase
- Classify files by criticality

**Semantic Analysis (Claude AI):**
- Recognize architectural and design patterns
- Identify red flags and anti-patterns
- Trace data and control flows
- Document contracts and invariants
- Assess quality and maintainability

**Documentation Maintenance:**
- Review and maintain documentation (Phase 6)
- Fix broken links and update navigation indexes
- Analyze and rewrite code comments (antirez standards)

**Use this skill when:**
- Analyzing a codebase you're unfamiliar with
- Generating documentation that explains WHY, not just WHAT
- Identifying architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- Building technical ground truth before a code review
- Onboarding to a new project

## How This Skill Is Invoked

This skill is the method; the commands apply it. `/codebase-xray:analyze` runs every phase inline in one context, and `/codebase-xray:team-analyze` partitions the target and dispatches the phases per partition to isolated workers, which read this skill directly. Both manage their state automatically under `.codebase-xray/` using the concurrent runs model below.

The skill's own name is `codebase-xray:xray-method`. `codebase-xray:analyze` names the command, and only the command: the two used to share a name, and on a host that lists both under one identifier the command shadowed the skill.

## Concurrent Runs Model

Multiple analyses can run at the same time (different targets, different sessions, or a re-analysis while an older one is still in flight). Every analysis is an isolated **run**:

```
.codebase-xray/
├── runs.json                          # registry: active runs + latest completed
├── runs/
│   └── <run-id>/                      # one directory per analysis run
│       ├── state.json                 # per-run phase tracking, flags, lineage
│       ├── snapshot/manifest.json     # the tree this run analyzed: files, symbols, hashes
│       ├── changes.json               # incremental runs: the change set since the parent
│       ├── changes.md                 # incremental runs: what changed and what it did to the claims
│       ├── knowledge/                   # Phase 0: navigation.md, documentation-leads.md
│       ├── 01-structure.md .. 07-final-report.md
│       ├── partitions/<name>/...      # team mode only
│       └── 08-interconnect-map.md     # team mode only
├── state.json                         # mirror of the latest published run
└── 01-structure.md .. 08-*.md         # mirror of the latest published run
```

Rules:

1. **Run identity.** `run-id` = slug of the target path + `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`, or the value of `--run-name <name>` (normalized to `[a-z0-9-]`; on collision append `-2`, `-3`, ...).
2. **Isolation.** A run writes ONLY inside `.codebase-xray/runs/<run-id>/` while in progress. Concurrent runs never share files.
3. **Registry.** `runs.json` holds `{"schema": 2, "active": [{run_id, target, mode, started_at}], "latest_completed": "<run-id>"}`. Commands register their run at start and update the registry at completion. Read-modify-write it; never blindly overwrite entries you did not create.
4. **Publish step.** On successful completion, the orchestrating command copies the run's `01..0N.md` files and `state.json` to the `.codebase-xray/` root and sets `latest_completed`. The root mirror is the **downstream contract**: consumers (`/senior-review:team-review`, `/senior-review:code-review`, `/codebase-mapper:map-codebase`, `/project-setup:create-claude-md`) keep reading `.codebase-xray/01-structure.md` etc. unchanged. If two runs finish concurrently, the last one to publish owns the root mirror; both remain intact under `runs/`.
5. **Resume.** On invocation, the command reads `runs.json`: active runs are offered for resume; completed runs can be archived or re-published. A root `state.json` containing `current_phase` with no `runs.json` present is a pre-runs legacy layout: offer to migrate it into `runs/legacy-<date>/` before starting.
6. **Mirror is for latest-state consumers only.** `.codebase-xray/` is a mutable convenience mirror of the latest published run. It MUST NOT be used by an orchestrated workflow to consume the output of a specific X-ray invocation: rule 4 makes the root mirror owned by whichever run published last, so a concurrent run can replace it between production and consumption. A workflow that started a run and then consumes it MUST retain and propagate the immutable run directory `.codebase-xray/runs/<run-id>/`. The general form: a specific invocation implies the immutable run directory, a latest-state consumer implies the mirror. One-shot commands asking for the most recent published analysis are correct on the mirror.
7. **Lineage.** Every run writes `snapshot/manifest.json`, the structural record of the tree it analyzed, which makes it a possible parent for a later run. An incremental run records its parent in `state.json -> parent_run` and in its `runs.json` entry. The chain of those values is the analysis history, and no other structure holds it. A mirror consumer never needs any of this: `snapshot/`, `changes.json` and `changes.md` stay in the run directory and are never published to the root.

## Incremental Updates

A second X-ray of the same target rebuilds from nothing only if nobody asked what changed. The mechanism that asks is `scripts/snapshot.py`, and every part of it runs outside the model.

**The snapshot** (`snapshot/manifest.json`, written by every run) records each file with its size, mtime and content hash, and each symbol with its line span and a hash of its body, plus the git commit as metadata. A class span encloses its methods, so editing a method moves both hashes. Three sets of files enter it: source in the parsed languages, with symbols, where CSS, SCSS and LESS carry one symbol per applied rule, except a minified stylesheet (any line over 10,000 characters), which stays file-level; configuration and documentation (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.md` and their kin), as file-level entries with no symbols; and presentation files no adapter parses (`.html`, `.htm`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, indented `.sass`), also file-level, because markup decides whether a screen renders, scrolls and can be completed, and a run that drops it can neither cite it nor notice that it changed. Any other extension is absent from the manifest and from every count derived from it, and the final report says so. Forbidden files never enter it, not even as a hash.

**The change set** (`changes.json`, written by `snapshot.py diff`) compares that manifest with the current worktree. Equal size and mtime means unchanged with no read at all; anything else is hashed, because a checkout moves mtimes without changing a byte. It classifies files and symbols, resolves the one-hop blast radius from the manifest's import edges, and scans the parent's phase files for every claim citing anything it touched. It recommends `incremental`, `full` (with reasons: too much changed, no parent manifest, an incomplete parent, flags differing from the parent's) or `none`.

**The carry** (`snapshot.py carry`) copies the parent's phase files, except the final report, which is never carried and is always regenerated. It renumbers every citation whose symbol survived, and marks every affected claim with `<!-- xray:stale reason=... cites=... -->`. The model then reads only the affected files and re-derives only the marked claims.

**The gate** (`snapshot.py check`) fails if any marker survives or any added symbol went undocumented. An incremental run does not publish until it passes. That gate is the whole reason an incremental result can be trusted the way a full one is: the claims it kept were not re-checked, so what it did not carry must be provably finished.

Two things this deliberately does not do. It never uses a git range as the source of truth, because the tree a developer wants re-analyzed is usually dirty and sometimes not in a repository at all; git is metadata. And it never widens the blast radius past one hop, because the transitive closure of imports is, on most codebases, the whole tree.

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: EVIDENCE-ANCHORED OUTPUT

Every file this skill produces is a set of claims about the code, each anchored to the code and each carrying a status. None of it is unquestionable. `/senior-review:team-review` re-derives its premises without reading the X-ray and refutes an X-ray claim whenever the code disagrees; that is the design working, not failing. What makes the output worth consuming is that every claim says where it came from and how sure it is.

### Mandatory Rules (VIOLATION = FAILURE)

1. **NEVER** document anything without reading the actual source code first
2. **NEVER** assume any existing documentation, comment, or docstring is accurate
3. **NEVER** write documentation based on memory, inference, or "what should be"
4. **ALWAYS** derive technical facts EXCLUSIVELY from reading and tracing actual code
5. **ALWAYS** cite `file:line` for every technical claim in a phase file, and add the qualified symbol (`file.py::Class.method`) where one exists. A stylesheet symbol is the rule's flattened selector, which carries spaces and punctuation, so it is cited inside single backticks exactly as the manifest names it, for example `theme.css::.dark #root > div:first-child`; the incremental gate matches that quoted form whole. The line locates the evidence for this run; the symbol survives the next edit. Downstream consumers (`premise-auditor`, the interconnect mapper, the review dimensions) read `file:line`
6. **ALWAYS** verify state machines, enums, constants against actual definitions
7. **TREAT** all pre-existing docs as unverified claims requiring validation
8. **MARK** every claim with the status the interconnect mapper uses: `verified` (enforced in code, cite where), `documented` (a document declares it, cite where), `unverified` (relied on, nothing enforces or documents it), `disputed` (two derivations disagree, cite both). `[UNVERIFIED - REQUIRES CODE CHECK]` stays the inline form for prose
9. **USE** qualified symbol names, never line numbers, in the verification markers of maintained documentation (`[VERIFIED: file.py::Class.method]`, see `references/analysis-templates.md`). Those markers persist across edits, where a phase file is regenerated every run

### Documents play two roles, and only one of them is constrained above

As **evidence**, a document is an unverified claim requiring validation. Rules 2 and 7 govern that role and are not negotiable: a document never establishes a technical fact.

As a **discovery lead**, a document is a first-class input that must be collected early. A project's own index telling you that a concept named X exists and lives in module Y is not a claim about behaviour; it is a pointer telling you where to look and what to look for. Refusing to read it does not make the analysis more rigorous, it makes it blind to intent and to code paths the structure alone does not reveal.

Phase 0 collects leads. Phase 6 audits documents as evidence. Never let the second role suppress the first.

See `references/analysis-templates.md` for the full verification trust model, temporal purity principle, and documentation status markers.

## Phase 0: Project Knowledge Discovery

Runs in **every depth, including `--depth=lite`**, and runs first, in the orchestrating context: reading project instructions and globbing for index files is cheap, and what it finds shapes what every later phase looks for.

Phases 1 through 7 keep their numbers. `--phase N` is a user-facing flag and renumbering would break every invocation that names a phase.

**Phase 0 is a preamble, not a selectable analysis phase.** It runs before every invocation, `--phase 5` and `--docs-only` included, and it does not change the numbering semantics of phases 1 to 7. `--phase 5` still means "run phase 5 and nothing else from the analysis set", with the preamble in front of it. `--phase 0` runs the preamble alone, which is a legitimate way to ask only "how does this repository document itself".

This phase owns discovery of **how the repository documents itself**. It does not evaluate whether the documentation is accurate, which is Phase 6.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and any equivalent project instruction file at the repository root and in the target's ancestors. Record any navigation instruction they give, especially a statement of the form "look here first to find where a concept lives".
2. Locate the canonical indexes the project actually uses. Glob for, at minimum: `**/SEARCH_INDEX.md`, `**/INDEX.md`, `docs/README.md`, `README.md`, `**/BY_DOMAIN.md`, `**/adr/**`, `**/decisions/**`, `**/architecture/**`, `**/domains/**`, `.codebase-map/INDEX.md`. Record what exists, not what you expected to exist.
3. For each concept, symbol and subsystem in the analysis scope, search the located documents for an entry. Record the concept, the document, and the anchor or heading that matched.
4. Write both output files. Every row is a lead with status `documented` or `unverified`. Nothing here is `verified`, because this phase reads no code.

`$RUN_DIR` below is the active run directory, `.codebase-xray/runs/<run-id>/`, per the Concurrent Runs Model above.

**Output file:** `$RUN_DIR/knowledge/navigation.md`

```markdown
# Project Knowledge Navigation

## Project instructions read
| File | Navigation rule it states |
|------|---------------------------|

## Canonical indexes found
| Index | Path | What it indexes |
|-------|------|-----------------|

## Conventions observed
[How this repository organizes its knowledge, in prose. Name the file the project treats as its semantic index, if it has one.]

## Not found
[Index kinds searched for and absent. An absent index is a fact worth recording.]
```

**Output file:** `$RUN_DIR/knowledge/documentation-leads.md`

```markdown
# Documentation Leads

> Leads, not truth. Every row is a pointer to where the project claims a concept lives.
> Status is `documented` or `unverified`. No row here is `verified`: this phase reads no code.

| Concept / symbol | Document | Anchor | Status |
|------------------|----------|--------|--------|

## Concepts in scope with no lead
[Concepts the scope touches for which no document was found. This list is what a
downstream consumer must discover independently.]
```

This section is the canonical copy. `/codebase-xray:analyze` carries the same procedure and templates in its own `## Phase 0` section so the command path is self-contained, and `/codebase-xray:team-analyze` runs the same phase once for the whole run. All three must move together: `/senior-review:team-review` reaches this phase through the `analyze` command and its Phase 1d consumes `knowledge/documentation-leads.md` from whichever path produced the run, while the `team-analyze` workers read this skill directly.

## Output Usage Guide

After analysis completes, consult the right file for your task:

| Your Task | Start With | Also Check |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Onboarding / understanding the project | 07-final-report, 01-structure | 04-semantics |
| Writing new feature | 01-structure (Where to Add), 02-interfaces | 04-semantics |
| Fixing a bug | 03-flows, 05-risks | 01-structure |
| Refactoring | 01-structure, 04-semantics, 05-risks | 03-flows |
| Code review | 02-interfaces, 05-risks | 06-documentation |
| Updating documentation | 06-documentation, 04-semantics | 02-interfaces |
| Finding where the project documents a concept | knowledge/documentation-leads.md | knowledge/navigation.md |

The two `knowledge/` files are Phase 0 output and are the only files in the set produced without reading code: every row is a lead, never a verified fact. `/senior-review:team-review` Phase 1d reads `knowledge/documentation-leads.md` from the run directory and joins it against its own independent discovery, so a run that skips Phase 0 leaves that consumer with an empty half.

## Forbidden Files

The analysis NEVER reads or includes contents from sensitive files: `.env`, `.env.*`, `credentials.*`, `secrets.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`, or any file containing API keys, passwords, or tokens. If encountered, note file existence only - never quote contents.

## Script Commands

All scripts live in `<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/`.

### 1. Analyze Single File

```bash
# Python
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file src/utils/circuit_breaker.py \
  --output-format markdown

# Java
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file src/main/java/com/example/UserService.java

# TypeScript
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file src/services/auth.ts

# Rust
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file src/lib.rs

# SQL / PL-SQL
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file migrations/0042_users.sql
```

**Parameters:**
- `--file` / `-f`: Relative or absolute path to file - **REQUIRED**. Any supported extension (see Language Support table).
- `--output-format` / `-o`: Output format (json, markdown, summary) - default: summary
- `--find-usages` / `-u`: Find all usages of exported symbols - default: false

### 2. Find Usages of One Symbol

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/analyze_file.py" \
  --file src/utils/circuit_breaker.py --find-usages --symbol CircuitBreaker
```

`--symbol` restricts the usage search to a single exported symbol; the script errors cleanly if the symbol is not exported by the file.

### 3. Structural Parse Only

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/ast_parser.py" src/services/auth.ts
```

Emits the raw structural extraction (classes, functions, imports, exports) as JSON. Reports the active parser in `notes`.

---

## Documentation Maintenance Commands (Phase 6)

### 4. Scan Documentation Health

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/doc_review.py" scan \
  --path docs/ --output doc_health_report.json
```

### 5. Validate Links

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/doc_review.py" validate-links \
  --path docs/ --fix
```

### 6. Verify Against Source Code

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/doc_review.py" verify \
  --doc docs/agents/lifecycle.md --source src/agents/lifecycle.py
```

### 7. Update Navigation Indexes

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/doc_review.py" update-indexes \
  --search-index docs/00_navigation/SEARCH_INDEX.md \
  --by-domain docs/00_navigation/BY_DOMAIN.md
```

### 8. Full Documentation Maintenance

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/doc_review.py" full-maintenance \
  --path docs/ --auto-fix --output doc_health_report.json
```

Executes: scan health, validate/fix links, identify obsolete files, update indexes, generate report.

---

## Comment Quality Commands (Antirez Standards)

### 9. Analyze Comment Quality

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/rewrite_comments.py" analyze \
  src/main.py --report
```

### 10. Scan Directory for Comment Issues

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/rewrite_comments.py" scan \
  src/ --recursive --issues-only
```

### 11. Generate Comment Health Report

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/rewrite_comments.py" report \
  src/ --output comment_health.md
```

### 12. Rewrite Comments

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/rewrite_comments.py" rewrite \
  src/main.py --apply --backup
```

### 13. View Standards Reference

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/rewrite_comments.py" standards
```

---

## Incremental Update Commands

### 14. Write a structural snapshot

```bash
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/snapshot.py" write <target> \
  --out <run-dir>/snapshot/manifest.json
```

Records the tree a run analyzed. Every run writes one, which is what makes it a possible parent.

### 15. Diff, carry and check an update

```bash
# what changed since a parent run, and which of its claims that affects
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/snapshot.py" diff \
  <parent-run-dir> <target> --out <run-dir> [--verify] [--threshold 0.4] [--flags '{"depth":"full"}']

# copy the parent's phase files, renumber citations, mark the stale claims
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/snapshot.py" carry <parent-run-dir> <run-dir>

# publication gate: no marker left, no undocumented new symbol
python "<plugin-root>/skills/xray-method/scripts/snapshot.py" check <run-dir>
```

`--verify` hashes every file instead of trusting size and mtime. `--threshold` is the affected-file ratio above which a full run is recommended instead.

## File Classification Criteria

| Classification | Criteria | Verification |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Handles authentication, security, encryption, sensitive data | Mandatory |
| **High-Complexity** | >300 LOC, >12 dependencies, state machines, async patterns | Mandatory |
| **Standard** | Normal business logic, data models, utilities | Recommended |
| **Utility** | Pure functions, helpers, constants | Optional |

The classifier matches patterns against raw file content (including comments and string literals), so treat its verdict as a triage signal to be confirmed by reading the file, not as ground truth.

## AI-Powered Semantic Analysis

### Five Layers of Understanding

| Layer | What | Who Does It |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1. WHAT** | Classes, functions, imports | Scripts (AST) |
| **2. HOW** | Algorithm details, data flow | Claude's first pass |
| **3. WHY** | Business purpose, design decisions | Claude's deep analysis |
| **4. WHEN** | Triggers, lifecycle, concurrency | Claude's behavioral analysis |
| **5. CONSEQUENCES** | Side effects, failure modes | Claude's systems thinking |

### Pattern Recognition

| Pattern Type | Examples | Documentation Focus |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Architectural** | Repository, Service, CQRS, Event-Driven | Responsibilities, boundaries |
| **Behavioral** | State Machine, Strategy, Observer, Chain | Transitions, variations |
| **Resilience** | Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Timeout | Thresholds, fallbacks |
| **Data** | DTO, Value Object, Aggregate | Invariants, relationships |
| **Concurrency** | Producer-Consumer, Worker Pool | Thread safety, backpressure |

### Red Flags to Identify

```
ARCHITECTURE:
- GOD CLASS: >10 public methods or >500 LOC
- CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY: A -> B -> C -> A
- LEAKY ABSTRACTION: Implementation details in interface

RELIABILITY:
- SWALLOWED EXCEPTION: Empty catch blocks
- MISSING TIMEOUT: Network calls without timeout
- RACE CONDITION: Shared mutable state without sync

SECURITY:
- HARDCODED SECRET: Passwords, API keys in code
- SQL INJECTION: String concatenation in queries
- MISSING VALIDATION: Unsanitized user input
```

### AI Analysis Workflow

```
1. SCRIPTS RUN FIRST -> classifier.py, ast_parser.py, usage_finder.py
2. CLAUDE ANALYZES -> Read source, apply semantic questions, recognize patterns, identify red flags
3. CLAUDE DOCUMENTS -> Use template, explain WHY not just WHAT, document contracts
4. VERIFY -> Re-trace the code path end to end; accept runtime evidence only when the user supplies it
```

## Analysis Loop Workflow

```
1. CLASSIFY -> LOC, dependencies, critical patterns, assign classification
2. READ & MAP -> AST structure, classes, functions, constants, state mutations
3. DEPENDENCY CHECK -> Internal imports, external imports, external calls
4. CONTEXT ANALYSIS -> Symbol usages, importing modules, message flows
5. CODE-PATH VERIFICATION (Critical/High-Complexity) -> Trace every call path the claim depends on; runtime logs or traces count only when the user supplies them, and are never invented
6. DOCUMENTATION -> Write the phase output file into the active run directory
```

## Best Practices

### Source Code Analysis (Phases 1-5)
1. Start with Phase 1 - foundation modules inform everything else
2. Never skip code-path verification for critical/high-complexity files. This is static analysis: runtime evidence is welcome when supplied, never required, never fabricated
3. Keep all writes inside the active run directory until the publish step

### Documentation Maintenance (Phase 6)
1. Run scan first to understand current state
2. Fix links before content - broken links indicate structural issues
3. Verify against code before updating documentation
4. Update indexes last to reflect final state

## Team Mode Integration

The classic `/codebase-xray:analyze` command runs every phase inline in one context on a single target. For monorepos, multi-language repos, or any target where one context would have to hold too much, switch to the team variant:

```
/codebase-xray:team-analyze <target>
```

The team command:
1. Auto-detects partitions (workspaces, top-level dirs, or language clusters) and shows the concrete scope before dispatch. A fresh run proceeds on the invocation's authorization, without requiring `--yes`; an unresolved choice or an explicit request for approval gets an answerable question, through a permitted input tool or ordinary chat.
2. Spawns three workers per partition in two waves (Wave 1 = Structure; Wave 2 = Behavior + Quality). Wave 2 workers read every partition's Wave 1 output, so cross-partition contracts and flows can be cited directly.
3. Synthesizes a backward-compatible `01..07.md` set inside the run directory; the publish step mirrors it to the `.codebase-xray/` root, so any downstream consumer (`/senior-review:team-review`, `/codebase-mapper:map-codebase`, `/project-setup:create-claude-md`) picks it up without changes.
4. Adds `08-interconnect-map.md` produced by `codebase-xray:semantic-interconnect-mapper` on top of the consolidated set, giving a global Call Graph, Contracts, Invariants, and Integration Hot-Spots view.

### Choosing between classic and team

| Repo profile                                        | Use classic | Use team |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Single package, < 200 files, one language           | ✓           |          |
| Monorepo (pnpm/npm/yarn/lerna/nx/turbo workspaces)  |             | ✓        |
| Multi-language (Python + TS, etc.) at top level     |             | ✓        |
| You want a global interconnection map produced in the same run |  | ✓        |
| You want `--phase N` or `--docs-only` control       | ✓           |          |
