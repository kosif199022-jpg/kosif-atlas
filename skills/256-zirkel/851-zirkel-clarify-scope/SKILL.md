name: zirkel-clarify-scope
description: >-
  Scopes an ambiguous task before any work begins — restates it with defaults
  made explicit, lists known facts (flagging low-confidence ones), and surfaces
  the interpretation forks that could send the work the wrong way. Use when a
  task's phrasing supports multiple reasonable interpretations, success criteria
  aren't stated, or scope is underspecified: "what exactly do you want here",
  "before I start, let me pin this down", a vague one-line request, or the first
  phase of zirkel-solve.

# zirkel-clarify-scope

Produce four structured outputs; validate `known_facts` and `flagged_uncertainties`
with the guard (`scoped_task` and `success_criteria` have no code-level check — get
them right by inspection). The guard enforces the confidence gates in code — a
missing `confidence` or `blocking` field is rejected, never defaulted.

The guard is `python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/zirkel.py"`, typed in full in each command below.

## Outputs

1. **scoped_task** — one clear restatement with every default interpretation
   stated inline (e.g. "…assuming *production* config, since none was named").
2. **known_facts** — a numbered list. Each fact carries a `confidence` (0-100).
   The guard marks any fact **below 90** with ⚠️.
3. **flagged_uncertainties** — for each interpretation fork:
   `{element, default_interpretation, confidence, other_readings, blocking}`.
   `confidence` and `blocking` are load-bearing and mandatory.
4. **success_criteria** — list of `{criterion, status}`.

## The rules (enforced in code)

- **Any uncertainty with confidence below 70 MUST be flagged.** The guard's
  `clarify` check computes `flagged` per entry — you do not eyeball it.
- **Any known fact below 90% confidence MUST be marked ⚠️.**
- **MUST pause and wait for user input if any flagged uncertainty is load-bearing**
  (`blocking: true`) for the deliverable. The guard returns `must_pause`.

## The rules (discipline, not guard-checkable)

- **MUST NOT silently adopt a default interpretation for a flagged item.** Present
  it. The guard has no way to check whether you actually presented a flagged item
  to the user rather than silently defaulting it — this is on you, not the guard.

## Validate

```
echo '{
  "flagged_uncertainties":[{"element":"target env","default_interpretation":"prod","confidence":55,"blocking":true,"other_readings":["staging"]}],
  "known_facts":[{"fact":"repo uses pnpm","confidence":95},{"fact":"CI is GH Actions","confidence":70}]
}' | python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/zirkel.py" clarify -
```

The result gives `flagged_count`, `blocking_uncertainties`, and `must_pause`. **If
`must_pause` is true, stop and ask the user** — do not proceed under a guess. A
non-zero exit means a gating field was missing; supply it, never invent it.

## Persist (so a later `zirkel-solve` can reuse this)

Generate a run id (`python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`), then write:

```
echo '{
  "run_id": "<run-id>",
  "raw_task": "<the exact text you were asked to scope>",
  "phase": "Clarify",
  "explore_ran": false,
  "clarify": {
    "scoped_task": "...",
    "known_facts": [...],
    "flagged_uncertainties": [...],
    "success_criteria": [...]
  }
}' | python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/zirkel.py" state-write - --output-dir .zirkel --to runs/<run-id>/state.json
```

This is what lets a later `zirkel-solve` run on the same task skip re-running Clarify
from scratch — it matches on `raw_task` **byte-for-byte** (see `zirkel-solve`'s own
"Reuse a prior run" step), so keep this identical to what you were actually given, not
a paraphrase.
