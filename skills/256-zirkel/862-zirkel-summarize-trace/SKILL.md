description: >-
  After a zirkel-solve pipeline finishes, produces a compact written record for
  handoff, PR comment, or documentation — 7 sections (6 if Explore did not run)
  covering what was asked, assumed, weighed, run, produced, revised, and NOT
  done. Use when a finished multi-stage run needs to be captured: "summarize
  what we did", "write this up for the PR", "hand this off", "document the
  run", after zirkel-solve completes.

# zirkel-summarize-trace

Turn a completed `zirkel-solve` run into a fixed 7-section record, then
**validate structure with the guard**.

The guard is `python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/zirkel.py"`, typed in full in each command below.

## Input

Read `.zirkel/runs/<id>/state.json`, written by `zirkel-solve`'s state-write
step — it is the source of `dag.stages`, `explore_ran`, and the content each
section below summarizes. If it is missing, ask the user for the run id or the
path to its state file; do not infer `dag.stages` or `explore_ran` from
conversation context.

## The 7 sections (exact order)

1. **What was asked**
2. **What was assumed**
3. **Approaches weighed** — **omit this section ENTIRELY if Explore did not run.**
   Do not leave it empty; remove it.
4. **What ran** — a table listing **every stage from `dag.stages`**.
5. **What was produced**
6. **What was revised** — **always present, even when nothing was revised. If
   nothing changed, say so explicitly.**
7. **What was NOT done**

Follow with a **completeness score table**: one row per section (7, or 6 if
Explore was skipped), scoring whether it is present and non-empty against the
rule for that section above.

```
| Section              | Present | Notes                                  |
|----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| What was asked       | yes     |                                         |
| What was assumed     | yes     |                                         |
| Approaches weighed   | omitted | Explore did not run                    |
| What ran             | yes     | 3/3 dag_stages listed                  |
| What was produced    | yes     |                                         |
| What was revised     | yes     | explicitly states nothing was revised  |
| What was NOT done    | yes     |                                         |
```

## Validate

The `explore_ran` flag is a first-class gating field the guard branches on:

```
echo '{
  "explore_ran": false,
  "dag_stages": ["gather","draft","check"],
  "sections": [
    {"title":"What was asked","body":"Add retry-with-backoff to the webhook dispatcher."},
    {"title":"What was assumed","body":"…"},
    {"title":"What ran","body":"…","stage_ids":["gather","draft","check"]},
    {"title":"What was produced","body":"…"},
    {"title":"What was revised","body":"Nothing was revised: all criteria scored above threshold."},
    {"title":"What was NOT done","body":"…"}
  ]
}' | python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/zirkel.py" trace -
```

The guard enforces: exactly the right sections in order, "Approaches weighed"
omitted iff Explore did not run, "What was revised" present and non-empty, and
every `dag_stages` id listed under "What ran". A non-zero exit means the structure
is wrong — fix it; the trace's value is its fixed shape.

## Output
- the 7 (or 6, if Explore was skipped) sections in order
- the completeness score table
