# Review-Deep Diff Planning and Static Analysis

Loaded by `SKILL.md` Steps 3-4. Execute the adaptive coverage plan and collect informational static-analysis evidence before semantic review.

## Step 3: Generate Diff and Coverage Plan

Based on detected scope:

- **Changes vs base branch** (default when PR detected): `git diff ${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`
- **Uncommitted changes** (no PR + uncommitted changes exist): `git diff HEAD` plus untracked files via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`
- **Explicit `PR_ARG`:** always use changes vs base branch

```bash
DIFF=$(git diff "${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD")
REVIEW_BASE="$BASE_BRANCH"
REVIEW_BACKEND=agent
REVIEW_CONCURRENCY=no
```

Read `../../lib/review-planning.md`, run the shared planner, display its coverage
plan, and follow it through the final coordinated pass. Do not interrupt solely
because of raw diff size. Process every review unit and the final pass in the
current context; the agent backend describes this session, not a child agent. Preserve `SCOPE_HINT` as review emphasis.

## Step 4: Static Analysis

If a Go project is detected (`go.mod` exists):

```bash
CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only "${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD" | grep '\.go$')
if [ -n "$CHANGED" ]; then
  echo "$CHANGED" | xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs go vet 2>&1 || true
  echo "$CHANGED" | xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs staticcheck 2>&1 || true
  echo "$CHANGED" | xargs -I{} dirname {} | sort -u | xargs go test -race -count=1 2>&1 || true
fi
```

Static-analysis failures are informational — they feed into the review, not block it.

When review includes browser screenshots, read
`<PLUGIN_ROOT>/lib/screenshot-evidence.md` before capturing. Initialize the
manifest and record every inspected route/capture, including failures, for the
Step 7 report. This does not add browser testing to reviews without visual work.
