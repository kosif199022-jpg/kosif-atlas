description: 'Check a devbook chapter against the code that implements it and report the drift verdict — aligned, code-ahead, spec-ahead, conflict, or unresolved — per chapter, without writing a chapter or a brief. Covers the same six kinds as capture-specs and apply-change: aggregate, domain-service, feature, setting, building-block, design-component. Use when: is the chapter still true, did the code drift from the spec, does the implementation match what we agreed, spec code drift, check before a review or a pull request, which side moved. Reads source and the tests each chapter names at its level — unit for an invariant, e2e or integration for a requirement; runs nothing and changes nothing. DO NOT USE FOR: writing the chapter (capture-specs) or implementing the delta (apply-change) — it names which of those the verdict calls for.'

# verify-change

Open the reply with `devbook@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

Read `assets/code-sync-protocol.md` first, then the kind's file under
`assets/spec-kinds/`. Nothing in them is repeated here.

**Kind.** Decided as `capture-specs` decides it: the chapter's `type`, or the
file where the folder has none. One kind per run, however wide the scope — a
sync unit or group excepted, per **The sync unit** in the protocol.

**Scope.** Any of: one chapter as `<path>#<heading-slug>` or by heading, a sync
unit or group, one file, a bounded context, or a whole devbook folder. A scope wider
than one chapter means every chapter of the run's kind inside it — a folder
given with no kind named takes the kind that folder's chapters carry, and says
which it took. Everything in scope lands in **one** table, `aligned` rows
included: the run's value is the shape of the whole, and a table per chapter
hides it.

**Inputs.** The scope, the bounded context where the kind has one, and the
repository root.

## Steps

1. Load the protocol and the kind's file. Read only the chapters in scope and
   what the kind's file says comes with them. Name the scope and the kind in
   the opening line, so a wide run says what it covered before it says what it
   found.
2. Resolve each counterpart by the protocol's ladder; record the rung.
3. Read the implementation, as the kind's file directs, then for each chapter
   the test files its `tests` field names at the level its type calls for —
   `unit` for an invariant, `e2e` or `integration` for a requirement. Read them
   as files: run no test and do not start the application; the run belongs to
   `capture-specs`. Only code that executes and tests that pass are evidence.
4. Reach exactly one verdict per chapter, with the evidence that settles it,
   specific enough to re-check. Mark it `unagreed` where the chapter's `status`
   says so, per the protocol's status table: a verdict against a draft is a
   verdict about a sketch.
5. Close with the protocol's report table — one table for the run, whatever
   its scope, `aligned` rows included, with its **Sync** and **Sweep** columns
   from `units.mjs` — and stop.
   The `Action` column names what the verdict calls for and nothing is done:
   `code-ahead` calls for `capture-specs`, `spec-ahead` for `apply-change`,
   `conflict` and `unresolved` for the question put to the user.

## Do not

- Do not write a chapter, a brief, an `annotation` fence, or a `tests` entry.
- Do not resolve a `conflict` by picking a side, or an `unresolved` by guessing.
- Do not touch a `status` line. A verdict is a report about drift, never about
  agreement.
