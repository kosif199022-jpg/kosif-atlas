description: 'Validate a repository''s devbook corpus without writing a generated file, and repair what it reports in the chapters — broken metadata references, malformed or missing meta blocks, and fields the schema no longer defines. Asks about the chapters only, never about the installation: stamp drift and outstanding migrations are not this skill''s question. Use when: the devbook-meta check fails or references do not resolve. Triggers on: "devbook validate", "validate devbook folders", "devbook check", "devbook-meta failed", "broken reference", "build.mjs --check".'

# devbook validate

Open the reply with `devbook@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

## Purpose

Validate the authored Markdown against the schema and write nothing generated; then
repair in the chapters whatever the check reports. One question: does every chapter
satisfy the schema, and does every reference resolve. Whether the installation is
current — the stamp, the migration ledger, the `AGENTS.md` section — is a question
about every component at once, and no single plugin's skill asks it.

This file exceeds the 40-line body budget on purpose. Most of it is the symptom
table in step 2 — one row per thing the generator can report, with the fix — and
compressing a lookup table costs a repair, not a sentence.

## Steps

1. **Check the authored Markdown** from the repository root:

   ```
   node .devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/build.mjs --check
   ```

   When `.devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/` is absent, run `devbook:update`, or
   `devbook:init` where devbook has no stamp yet — it materializes the checker.

   Exit codes:

   | Code | Meaning | Action |
   |------|---------|--------|
   | `0` | Every reference resolves, every block matches the schema | Done |
   | `1` | One or more problems at `error` severity | Go to step 2 |
   | `2` | No devbook folder found under `.devbook/`, or `--scope` names one the repository has not adopted | Wrong directory or wrong scope, the repo has not adopted the convention — run `devbook:init` — or its folders sit at the repository root, which the message names: move them under `.devbook/` |

   `--check` parses and reports without writing. Add `--root <path>` when running
   from outside the repository root, and `--scope <folder>` to narrow the run to
   one devbook folder.

2. **Fix the reported problems.** Each problem names the file it came from.
   Common causes and the correct fix:

   | Problem | Cause | Fix |
   |---------|-------|-----|
   | Unresolved reference | A `related` or `depends-on` target was renamed, moved, or never existed | Repoint the reference at the real chapter, or remove it if the relationship is gone. Never delete the target to silence the error. |
   | Missing file-level `meta` block | The top-level `#` heading has no block, or the file has no `#` heading at all | Add the heading and its block per `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` |
   | Heading with no `meta` block | A heading carries no block (warning) | Add one if it is an addressable chapter for this folder. A structural section heading is legal and stays a warning — this one never fails the run |
   | Malformed `meta` block | Wrong field name, wrong value shape, or bad fencing | Correct it against `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` |
   | Removed schema field | An `order` field left over from before reading order moved to the folder convention | Delete the field. If the generated order is then wrong, give the documents a `number` or mark the entry point `index: root` |
   | Duplicate `number` | Two documents in one directory claim the same number | Renumber one of them, in its filename or its `number` field, so each number identifies one document |
   | Two `index: root` | Two documents in one directory both claim to be its entry point | Keep the one that introduces the directory and drop the field from the other |
   | Bad `number` / `date` / `index` value | A non-integer number, a date that is not `YYYY-MM-DD`, or an `index` other than `root`/`exclude` | Correct the value; `date` is a calendar day the content records, not a modification timestamp |
   | `index` or `number` on a chapter block | Both place the document in its directory, so they belong on the file-level block | Move the field to the file-level block, or drop it if the chapter needed neither |
   | No entry point | A directory the convention covers is missing its root document, or has excluded it | Create the expected file, or mark the right one `index: root` |
   | Unknown status or type | A value outside the allowed ladder or value set | Use one of the values the message lists — the folder's own instruction file, or the `.devbook/statuses.json` rule it names |
   | Error on `.devbook/statuses.json` | The repository's ladder lists the resting value, a decision rung, a rung off the `tech/` or `ai/` rating ladder, or has a malformed rule | Fix the file, never the chapters; the offending value is ignored meanwhile. The limits are in `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` under `status` |
   | Approval with no signature | `status: approved` with no `approved-by` or `approved-at` (warning) | Add who approved it and on what day, or drop the rung — an unsigned approval records no decision |
   | Approval record with no rung | `approved-by` or `approved-at` on a chapter whose `status` is not `approved` (warning) | Either restore `status: approved`, or delete both fields in the same change that dropped the rung |
   | Bad `approved-at` value | Not a `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar day | Correct it; it is the day a person approved the chapter |
   | Missing `status` | A `tech/` or `ai/` block with no `status` — those folders rate, so absence states nothing | Add `status` from the folder's ladder. In `domain/`, `arc42/`, and `design/` an absent `status` is correct and means the resting value `active` |
   | Resting `status` stated explicitly | A `domain/`, `arc42/`, or `design/` block writes `status: active`, which is what an absent field already says (warning) | Delete the line. If the block is then empty, keep the empty `meta` fence — it is what makes the heading an addressable chapter |
   | Missing `type` | A `domain/`, `tech/`, or `ai/` block with no `type`, or a heading still carrying a kind prefix | Add `type` from the folder's value set and strip the prefix from the heading |
   | Bare key in `feature-flag` or `setting` | An application key where the field takes a `<path>#<slug>` reference to the switch's chapter in `context.md` — the pre-011 shape | Run the `011-context-md` migration, or point the field at the chapter that carries the key |
   | Switch reference to the wrong kind | A `feature-flag` or `setting` reference resolving to a chapter that is not of that type | Point it at the `feature-flag` or `setting` chapter in the context's `context.md` |
   | Switch chapter without `key` | A `feature-flag` or `setting` chapter with no single `key`, or a flag `default` outside `on`/`off`, or a setting `scope` outside `user`/`tenant`/`system` | Write the key as the code spells it, and the value from the set |
   | Bad `effort` value | A list, a fraction, a negative number, or a word such as "large" | Write a single non-negative integer — `effort` is a story-point estimate the tooling totals |
   | Bad `roadmap` entry | A path, free text, or anything that is not a lowercase kebab-case slug (warning) | Write the slug. It names something in the consuming repository, so only the shape is checked, never the vocabulary |
   | Bad or missing `stage` | An `ai/` chapter whose `stage` is not one of `plan`, `code`, `build`, `test`, `release`, `deploy`, `operate`, `monitor` (error), or a non-`concept` `ai/` chapter with no `stage` (warning) | Write the stage word from `devbook-ai.md`; the vocabulary is the loop's, not the repository's |
   | Unrecognized field | A field the folder's schema does not define, usually a typo (warning) | Correct the name against `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`, or move it under `ext.<namespace>` if it is an extension's own state |
   | Empty or null field value | A field set to `[]` or `null` (warning) | Delete the line. An absence is spelled by omitting the field, never by writing it empty |
   | Malformed `tests` entry | Not `<level>:<runner>:<selector>`, an unknown level, or a chapter reference pasted into `tests` | Rewrite the entry per "Linking test cases" in `devbook-chapter-metadata.md`. A link to another chapter belongs in `related` |
   | Unmapped test runner | A `tests` entry names a runner the tooling has no command for, so nothing can offer to run it (warning) | Leave it if the runner is genuinely what runs the test; add its command to `TEST_RUNNERS` in `.devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/metadata.mjs` to make it runnable |
   | Literal escape sequence in body text | A `` `r`n `` or `\n` was written instead of a line break, usually by a tool writing the file through a shell | Replace it with a real line break. Check whether a heading was glued onto the previous line and silently stopped being a heading |
   | Annotation before the first heading | An `annotation` fence with no chapter above it | Move it under the chapter it is about. A note is addressed by chapter and ordinal, so one outside a chapter has no address |
   | Annotation missing `author`, `date`, or `body` | The three required fields of a note | Add them. `author` is written, never inferred — a note outlives the rewrite `git blame` would have had to follow |
   | Unknown annotation `kind` or `status` | A value outside `comment`/`question`/`suggestion`/`flag`, or outside `open`/`resolved` | Use one of the listed values; both sets are closed so a reader can sort by them |
   | Annotation `quote` matches nothing above | The quoted phrase is not in the block the note attaches to (warning) | The passage probably moved out from under the note. Move the note to follow it, or drop the `quote`. Never resolve the attachment by the quote — position is the anchor |
   | Annotation `ext` is not a mapping | `ext` written as a scalar or a list | Write it as `ext.<namespace>`. L0 validates the shape and never reads inside it |
   | Unrecognized annotation field | A field outside the closed core set (warning) | Move it under `ext.<namespace>` — that is the seam an extension adds state through |

   Fix the **source Markdown**, never a generated file. Anything under `_meta/`
   is a layered plugin's derived output, and this check never writes it.

3. **Re-run the check** until it exits `0`.

4. **Never refresh from here.** This skill writes nothing: the committed `_meta/`
   indexes, where a repository keeps them, are refreshed by the paths its
   `AGENTS.md` names and by their scheduled job, never in a session beside a
   chapter edit — that is what makes the generated JSON conflict on merge.

## When CI fails but local is clean

A CI failure is about the *authored Markdown*, not the indexes: the workflow
fails only on an unresolved reference or a schema violation, which is
step 1 above. Drifted `_meta/` files produce a `::warning::` and never fail the
run, so "the indexes were not committed" is not the explanation.

If step 1 exits `0` locally but CI is red, compare against the merge result
rather than your branch tip — a reference can break when two branches land
together even though each was clean on its own.

If the checker itself is missing from the repository, restore it with
`devbook:update`, or `devbook:init` where devbook has no stamp yet, rather than
copying files ad hoc — a copy made by hand lands unstamped, and the next
reconcile cannot tell it from a customized file.

## Do not

- Do not hand-edit files under `_meta/` to make the check pass.
- Do not delete a chapter to resolve a dangling reference — repoint the reference.
- Do not weaken or remove the CI workflow to get a pull request green.
- Do not apply a migration from here, and do not edit the stamp. Both belong to
  `devbook:update`, which records what it did as it does it.
