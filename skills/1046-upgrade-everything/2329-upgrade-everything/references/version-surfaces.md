# Version Surfaces

Use this checklist to find every repository version reference before resolving upstream versions. It extends the `pin-everything` surface audit with upgrade-oriented surfaces such as release tools, schema URLs, marketplace metadata, and version-like literals in docs or scripts.

## Exclusions

Exclude generated, vendored, and cache directories from all searches unless the user explicitly asks to audit them:

- `.git/`
- `node_modules/`
- `.yarn/`
- `.lake/`
- `vendor/`
- `dist/`
- `target/`
- `.venv/`
- package manager cache directories
- generated coverage or build output directories

## Candidate Rules

- A candidate is any version surface where a current upstream value can be newer, unknown, blocked, or intentionally held.
- High-risk candidates stay in the matrix. Risk changes recommendation and validation, not inclusion.
- Low-reward candidates stay in the matrix. Reward changes priority, not inclusion.
- If a surface appears in generated output and source input, report the source input as the editable candidate and summarize the generated output as affected.
- If the same dependency appears in multiple places, group the occurrences under one candidate only when they share an owner and can be upgraded together.
