# Toolkit Plugin Reference

## Purpose

The verified schema and mechanics of Claude Code / Codex plugins **as used in this
repo** — nothing generic, nothing unverified.

## When to use

- Writing or editing any `plugin.json` (either variant), `marketplace.json`, or
  `packages/condux-opencode/package.json`.
- Deciding whether a field difference between the two manifests is a bug or by design.
- Explaining how the four install channels consume this repo.

## When not to use

- The end-to-end authoring sequence → `toolkit-foundry`.
- Gating whether a change is shippable → `toolkit-change-control`.
- Host-tool features beyond what this repo uses (MCP servers, commands dirs) —
  unverified here; consult official plugin docs instead.

## Inputs required

The plugin/manifest in question, plus `tests/plugin-manifests.test.mjs`,
`tests/manifest-parity.test.mjs`, and — for the two variant channels and the npm
package — `tests/opencode-dist.test.mjs` and `tests/cursor-dist.test.mjs` as the
executable source of truth.

## Procedure — the schema facts

**Three manifests per plugin, not two.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` are the hand-edited pair; the root `plugin.json`
beside them is **generated** (Agent Plugins 1.0.0) and never hand-written. Docket
additionally ships two MCP files in two dialects. Each section below says which
kind it is.

### plugin.json (both `.claude-plugin/` and `.codex-plugin/` variants) — hand-edited

| Field | Status in this repo |
|---|---|
| `name` | required (test-enforced), == plugin dir name |
| `version` | required (test-enforced); the pair must match — bump policy (which bump when, cache rationale) has its home in `toolkit-change-control` |
| `description` | required (test-enforced); may carry platform wording ("Claude Code skill for…" / "Codex skill for…") — identity fields `name`/`version`/`skills` must match across the pair |
| `author.name` | required (test-enforced) |
| `repository`, `license`, `keywords` | convention — present in every manifest (26 at the 2026-08-15 count; 13 plugin pairs) |
| `skills` | required (test-enforced). **Two shapes since 2026-08-14 (docket #29):** a standalone plugin uses `"./skills/<plugin-dir-name>"`; a bundle uses `"./skills"` — the dir of skill dirs — because bundle members flattened to depth one for Agent Plugins discovery. Both hosts accept either. Was one rule for both before the flattening |
| `interface` | **codex manifest only** since 2026-07-29 (parity-test-enforced: present in codex, absent in claude). Codex-native install-surface block (displayName, shortDescription ≤125 chars per Codex docs, longDescription, developerName, category, defaultPrompt; optionally capabilities/websiteURL/logo/screenshots). **Verified 2026-07-08: unknown to Claude Code** — ignored at load, validator warns, `--strict` errors. Previously duplicated into the claude manifest for parity; dropped so `claude plugin validate --strict` passes clean, since Claude Code never read the field anyway |
| `hooks` | **codex manifest only** — two carriers with two path shapes: condux points at plugin root (`"hooks": "./hooks/codex-hooks.json"`), concord points into its skill dir (`"hooks": "./skills/remember/hooks/codex-hooks.json"` — one level shallower since the 2026-08-14 flattening); both resolve relative to the plugin root, so either shape is valid. BOTH hosts default to loading `hooks/hooks.json` when no manifest field exists (verified in both hosts' docs); the codex-side field overrides that default so Codex loads the Stop-only file instead of Claude's PreToolUse file (commit 95425c8). A missing claude-side `hooks` field is BY DESIGN, not a parity bug. **Hook commands use the host's own plugin-root variable** — Claude Code substitutes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, Codex substitutes `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and does NOT set Claude's (verified 2026-07-10, Codex 0.144.1: the unexpanded variable made condux's Stop hook exit 1 on every turn; parity-test-enforced) |

### Verified host field support (2026-07-08)

Method: `claude plugin validate [--strict]` (Claude Code 2.1.204) run on this repo's
real manifests, plus both official schema docs
(code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference, developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build).

| Field | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | required — the ONLY required field | required |
| `version`/`description`/`author`/`homepage`/`repository`/`license`/`keywords` | recognized | recognized (documented publisher/discovery metadata) |
| `skills`/`hooks`/`mcpServers` | recognized (plus: `commands`, `agents`, `outputStyles`, `lspServers`, `dependencies`, `userConfig`, `channels`, `defaultEnabled`) | recognized (plus: `apps`) |
| `interface` | **unknown — ignored at load**; `claude plugin validate` warns; docs bless foreign-ecosystem metadata (warning, not error); `--strict` FAILS on it | recognized — native install-surface block |
| `displayName` (top-level) | recognized (v2.1.143+; names the plugin in the `/plugin` picker) | not documented top-level — Codex uses `interface.displayName` |
| unknown fields generally | ignored at runtime; validate warns; `--strict` errors | tolerance undocumented/untested |

The doctrine was flipped on 2026-07-29: `interface` now lives only in the codex
manifest, so every claude manifest validates clean under `--strict`. The trigger was
the official plugin directory — submissions are reviewed against unstated "quality and
security standards", and a `--strict` failure is the most visible thing a reviewer can
run. Wiring `claude plugin validate --strict` into CI is now safe; it is not wired yet
(it would add a `claude` CLI dependency to the test job).

### Root `plugin.json` (Agent Plugins 1.0.0) — GENERATED, never hand-edited

Since 2026-08-14 (docket #29) every plugin also carries a spec manifest at
`dist/plugins/<name>/plugin.json`, making it loadable by Cursor and any
[agent-plugins.org](https://agent-plugins.org) client with no changes. Claude
Code and Codex ignore it — they read their own `.{claude,codex}-plugin/` files,
and the root manifest is inert on both (`claude plugin validate --strict` passes
with it present).

`scripts/generate-agent-manifests.mjs` derives it from
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the richer manifest) during sync. Same doctrine as
`marketplace.json` and the doc catalogs: **registration data has one declared
source.** Hand-editing it is the drift the generator exists to prevent —
`tests/agent-plugins.test.mjs` fails on any byte that differs from generator
output.

The spec schema is **closed**. Only these fields may appear:

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `$schema` | constant | `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json` |
| `name` | `name` | must match `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9.-]*[a-z0-9])?$`, ≤64, no `--` or `..` |
| `version` | `version` | semver recommended, not enforced |
| `description` | `description` | |
| `author` | `author` | object; only `name`/`email`/`url` keys allowed |
| `repository` | `repository` | plain string |
| `license` | `license` | SPDX recommended |
| `keywords` | `keywords` | string array |

**Never emitted:** `skills` (the spec has no such field — discovery is by fixed
location), `interface` (codex-only), `hooks` (not a spec component), `homepage`
(no source field today), `extensions` (reserved for client-specific data).

Two severities, and the difference matters: an unknown *top-level* field is
reported-and-ignored, but **any other schema violation is fatal** — the client
rejects the whole plugin without loading a single component. The generator emits
only the closed set so there is nothing to reject.

**Discovery never recurses.** Spec clients read skills only as immediate children
of `skills/`; a nested tree fails *silently* — plugin valid, zero skills. That is
why bundle members flattened to `dist/plugins/<bundle>/skills/<skill>/`, and why
`tests/agent-plugins.test.mjs` pins depth one.

### docket's two MCP dialects — `mcp.json` (generated placement) vs `.mcp.json`

Docket ships both, side by side, because neither host reads the other's file:

| | Claude Code | Agent Plugins spec |
|---|---|---|
| File | `.mcp.json` | `mcp.json` |
| `type` | omitted | `"stdio"` — **required** |
| Root variable | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` |
| `$schema` | none | `…/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json` |

The variable grammar is the whole reason two files exist — one file would be
wrong for one host. Both are sourced from `plugins/docket/` and copied by
`sync_plugin_files`. **Keep them in lockstep by hand when the server path
changes**; `tests/agent-plugins.test.mjs` asserts the spec file keeps its dialect
but cannot know the two should agree on the path.

### marketplace.json (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, repo root)

Top level: `$schema`, `name`, `description`, `owner{name,email}`, `plugins[]`.
Per entry — exactly: `name`, `description`, `author{name}`, `source`
(`./dist/plugins/<name>`, `./`-prefixed, test-enforced), `category`. **No version
field.** Fields like `strict`/`skills`/`keywords` appear in upstream examples but in
none of this repo's entries. Note: `author` is `{ "name": "Hieu Vi" }` in marketplace
entries but `{ "name": "jabworks" }` in plugin.json manifests — historical convention,
consistent within each file kind.

**Description divergence is by design** (ratified 2026-08-04): a marketplace
entry's `description` is storefront copy for the `/plugin` picker; the
plugin.json `description` is install metadata and may carry platform wording.
They are not kept in sync and no test enforces parity — don't "fix" the drift.

### The four install channels

| Channel | Reads | Ignores |
|---|---|---|
| `npx skills add jabworks/agentic-toolkit` (vercel-labs/skills) | top-level `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `dist/`, all manifests |
| `/plugin install <name>@jabworks-agentic-toolkit` | `marketplace.json` → `source` → the dist plugin dir → its manifest → its `skills` path | `skills/`, `dist/opencode/`, `dist/cursor/` |
| OpenCode | `dist/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | every manifest in the repo |
| Cursor (2.4+, native SKILL.md) | `dist/cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | every manifest in the repo |

Consequence: a broken manifest is invisible to three of the four channels — test each
channel's own inputs, never infer one from another.

### The variant trees (`dist/opencode/` and `dist/cursor/`, both generated)

No manifest exists or is read on either host. Both surface **`description` only**
and ignore unknown frontmatter, so both builds fold `when_to_use` into
`description` and drop the field; everything else copies byte-for-byte.
`scripts/build-cursor.mjs` imports the fold (`transformSkill`, `copyTransformed`)
from `scripts/build-opencode.mjs` — one transform, two output trees, so the
trees cannot drift from each other until a host deliberately diverges. Hard
limits:

- The **merged** `description` must fit the 1024-char cap on both hosts
  (`tests/opencode-dist.test.mjs` and `tests/cursor-dist.test.mjs` each enforce
  it). A skill can pass the 500-char source budget and still blow this — check
  after editing either field.
- Only the skill's own top-level `SKILL.md` is transformed. A nested `SKILL.md`
  (eval fixture under `references/` or `evals/`) is data and copies verbatim.
- **Cursor only:** frontmatter `name` must equal the skill's folder name.
  Already guaranteed repo-wide by `tests/skill-invariants.test.mjs`, but a
  rename that slipped past it would fail on Cursor alone.
- Never point Cursor at top-level `skills/` — it never reads `when_to_use`, so a
  condux-style skill would load and then trigger only on its thin `description`.
  Nothing errors; the breakage is invisible. That is what `dist/cursor/` is for.

### The npm package (`packages/condux-opencode/` → `@jabworks/condux`)

A fifth surface, not a skills channel — it ships the OpenCode *plugin* (agent
injection via the config hook, opt-in `CONDUX_PLAN_REVIEW=1` session.idle
listener), not skills. Standard npm manifest; the repo-specific constraints are:

| Constraint | Why |
|---|---|
| `index.js` exports the plugin **named only** — no default re-export | OpenCode calls every export as a plugin function; a default doubles hook registration (`08cc554`) |
| `agents/` is generated, listed in `files` | built from `skills/subagent-execution/agents/*.md`; `tests/opencode-dist.test.mjs` fails on drift |
| root `package.json` has no `"type": "module"` | it would break the CommonJS reference scripts under `skills/*/references/`; those self-protect with their own `references/package.json` since `f1e4b53` |
| version bumps go through changesets, not by hand | `pnpm changeset` → release.yml opens the version PR → publishes via npm OIDC trusted publishing (no `NPM_TOKEN`) |

### SKILL.md frontmatter

Parsed by every host: `name`, `description`. House convention fields observed in this
repo: `when_to_use` (second half of the trigger contract), `argument-hint`, `effort`,
`disable-model-invocation`. Budgets: description ≤ 500 chars,
frontmatter ≤ 1024 (test-enforced) — plus the merged-description cap above, which
applies to both variant channels.

### Cache behavior

Installed plugin copies refresh only on a version change — see the stale-1.3.4
incident (`a4f4aa8`). Shipping a fix without a bump ships nothing.

## Evidence required

For any schema claim beyond this table: point at a real manifest in `dist/plugins/`
or a test assertion. For claims about host-tool internals: mark unverified.

## Output artifact

A correct manifest (or a field-level diff of what to change), pair-consistent.

## Common traps

- "Fixing" the missing claude-side `hooks` field on condux — it's by design.
- Hand-editing the root `plugin.json` — it's generated from
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; edit that and run sync.
- Adding a useful-looking field to the root `plugin.json` — the spec schema is
  closed, and only *unknown top-level* fields degrade gracefully. Anything else
  is fatal: the client drops the whole plugin.
- Nesting a new bundle's skills below `skills/<name>/` — spec discovery never
  recurses, and the failure is silent (valid plugin, zero skills).
- Adding `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` beside the root manifest — Cursor detects
  the format *from* the manifest, so shipping both is ambiguous. Never both.
- Changing docket's server path in one MCP file — `.mcp.json` and `mcp.json` are
  two dialects of the same registration and drift silently.
- Copying `strict`/`skills` arrays into marketplace entries from upstream examples.
- Editing one manifest of the pair (`ba69d2b` precedent).
- Looking for a manifest to register a skill with OpenCode or Cursor — there
  isn't one on either host; the skill appears the moment
  `dist/opencode/skills/<name>/` or `dist/cursor/skills/<name>/` is generated.
- Pointing a Cursor install at top-level `skills/` because "that's the source" —
  Cursor never reads `when_to_use`, so the skill loads with a thin trigger and
  fails silently. `dist/cursor/skills/` exists for exactly this.
- Hand-editing `version` in `packages/condux-opencode/package.json` — changesets
  owns that field; a manual bump collides with the version PR.

## Bad behavior this prevents

The pre-2026-07-08 state this table replaced: 7 of 8 plugin pairs disagreed on the
`skills` path form and the Claude manifests carried `interface` inconsistently — each
new plugin copied a different wrong example. The table + parity test pin one shape.
Since 2026-07-29 that shape is: `interface` in the codex manifest, never the claude
one, so `--strict` stays clean for directory submissions.

## Related skills

`toolkit-foundry` (uses these schemas in its templates), `toolkit-change-control`
(version-bump rules), `toolkit-debugging-playbook` (manifest-caused symptoms).

## Provenance and maintenance

Re-verify volatile claims with:
- `node --test tests/plugin-manifests.test.mjs tests/manifest-parity.test.mjs tests/opencode-dist.test.mjs tests/cursor-dist.test.mjs tests/agent-plugins.test.mjs`
- `node scripts/generate-agent-manifests.mjs && git status --short` — clean tree
  means every root `plugin.json` matches its generator
- `node -e 'for (const m of require("fs").globSync("dist/plugins/*/.{claude,codex}-plugin/plugin.json")) console.log(m, require("./" + m).skills)'`
- `claude plugin validate dist/plugins/<p> --strict` — official validator (expect a
  clean pass, no warnings, since `interface` moved to the codex manifest on 2026-07-29)
- `node scripts/build-opencode.mjs && node scripts/build-cursor.mjs && git status
  --short` — clean tree means both variant channels and the package's `agents/`
  are in sync with source

Last generated: 2026-07-08 (host-support matrix verified same day; OpenCode +
npm-package sections added 2026-07-23; hooks row + counts refreshed 2026-08-04;
Cursor channel folded in 2026-08-14 — three channels became four, and the OpenCode

MCP dialects documented 2026-08-14, making it three manifests per plugin, not two)
Known uncertainty:
- Codex's tolerance of fields IT doesn't recognize is untested — this repo's manifests
  contain only Codex-documented fields, so it's never exercised. No codex-side
  validator found (codex 0.142.5 `plugin` has only add/list/marketplace/remove).
- `interface.shortDescription` ≤125 chars is docs-stated, not validator-verified
  (this repo's max is 55).
- The `$schema` URL in marketplace.json is not fetched/validated by anything here.
- OpenCode's 1024-char description cap is enforced locally by
  `tests/opencode-dist.test.mjs`; the host's own behaviour past that limit
  (truncate vs reject) was never observed — the repo has stayed under it.
- No OpenCode-side manifest validator exists to check against, and the
  description-only routing claim comes from the host's `<available_skills>`
  listing, not from a schema.
- No Agent Plugins validator was run against the generated root manifests — the
  closed field set is honoured by construction (the generator emits only it) and
  asserted by `tests/agent-plugins.test.mjs`, not confirmed by a spec client.
  Cursor loaded the plugins in a local-install check; that is evidence one client
  accepts them, not that the schema is fully satisfied.
- Cursor's 1024-char cap is assumed equal to OpenCode's and enforced locally by
  `tests/cursor-dist.test.mjs`; no Cursor-side validator or documented limit was
  found to confirm it. The repo has stayed well under either way.
- Cursor global installs are unreliable upstream: vercel-labs/skills#421 (the CLI
  writes `~/.agents/skills/` where the docs say `~/.cursor/skills/`; fix PR #464
  unmerged as of 2026-08-14), compounded on WSL by `~` resolving to the Windows
  home rather than the WSL one. Project-level `.cursor/skills/` is the path
  verified to work here. Full detail: `specs/cursor-channel/quirks.md`.
