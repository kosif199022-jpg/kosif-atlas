description: "Use only when the user has explicitly enabled fix mode for a domain, to apply the mechanical findings from a prior cupertino-handbook-check pass. Trigger only on explicit requests like 'fix the mechanical handbook findings' AFTER the user has turned on fix mode — never infer consent from a check report alone. Never touches mechanical:false findings, never commits or pushes. Not for code-modernization or idiom findings from code_idiom_summary.json — those belong to befund-idiom-fix. If no handbook_check_DOMAIN_summary.json exists for the domain, this is not the audit the user means."

Apply only the mechanical findings from an existing `cupertino-handbook-check` report — nothing that needs design judgment, and nothing beyond what was already found and verified.

## Mode gate — checked before anything else

This skill's dispatch is itself gated by a PreToolUse hook: it reads `.claude/cupertino.local.md` for a `fix:` block containing `mode: fix`, and denies the dispatch outright if that setting isn't present. If you're executing this skill body, that gate already passed for this invocation — but if the user asks you to "just fix it" without having set this, **stop and report plainly** that `handbook.fix.mode` is not `fix`, and tell them what to add to `.claude/cupertino.local.md`:
```markdown
---
fix:
  mode: fix
---
```
Do not attempt any workaround.

## Steps

1. **Parse the domain**, locate `.cupertino/handbook_check_<domain>_summary.json` from the most recent `cupertino-handbook-check` run. If it doesn't exist, tell the user to run that check first.
2. **Validate the summary on read, not just on trust** — a stale or hand-edited findings file could be missing the fields this whole process gates on:
   ```bash
   cat ".cupertino/handbook_check_${domain}_summary.json" | python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validators.py" handbook-check-summary
   ```
   If this exits non-zero, stop — do not attempt to guess or repair the missing fields yourself. Report the validator's errors and ask the user to re-run `cupertino-handbook-check`.
3. **Filter to `mechanical: true` findings only.** Everything else is explicitly out of scope for this skill — it requires design judgment `handbook-remediator` is built to refuse.
4. **Mark the fix pass active**, which the PreToolUse hook uses to block any `git commit`/`git push`/destructive command for the duration:
   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" set handbook-fix-active
   ```
5. **Run the fix pipeline** via the Workflow tool:
   ```
   Workflow({ scriptPath: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflows/handbook-fix.js", args: { findings: [...] } })
   ```
   This clusters findings by `(file, rule)`, dispatches `handbook-remediator` once per cluster (never touching anything outside the cited file:line, never verifying its own work), and immediately dispatches a **fresh, independent** `handbook-verifier` per finding — one that is never shown the remediator's own description, rationale, or confidence, only the original pre-fix evidence and the rule text. Both constraints are backstopped by the PreToolUse hook regardless of what the workflow script does.

   If this step errors, is interrupted, or any verifier rejects a fix, still run step 6 to clear `handbook-fix-active` before reporting the failure — do not leave the flag set on a failed or partial run. Only skip step 6 if the state file itself cannot be written, in which case tell the user to clear `handbook-fix-active` manually.
6. **Clear the flag**:
   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/state.py" clear handbook-fix-active
   ```
7. **Report one accept/fail line per finding fixed** — the remediation outcome and the independent verifier's verdict, side by side, so a "fixed" claim that the verifier actually rejected is visible, not hidden.
8. **Never commit or push**, and never touch test files or CI configuration — this skill's job ends at the working tree.

## Output format

Mode-gate confirmation → validated findings count (mechanical vs. skipped) → per-finding accept/fail table (remediation status + verifier verdict) → explicit statement that nothing was committed or pushed.

```
Mode gate: handbook.fix.mode = fix (confirmed)
Findings: 4 mechanical, 2 skipped (design judgment required)

| finding            | file:line              | remediation | verifier verdict |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| spacing-token-4pt   | src/Card.swift:82       | fixed       | accepted          |
| color-literal-hex   | src/Card.swift:104      | fixed       | rejected          |

Nothing was committed or pushed.
```

When the summary has no `mechanical: true` findings:

```
Mode gate: handbook.fix.mode = fix (confirmed)
Findings: 0 mechanical, 3 skipped (design judgment required)

Nothing to fix — no mechanical findings in this report.
Nothing was committed or pushed.
```
