# Supported Guides

Each entry names a style guide, how to detect the files it covers, the routing globs written into the entry `SKILL.md`, and the bundled checklist installed as `.github/skills/code-review/<guide>.md`. Detection runs over `git ls-files` after the exclusions in step 2 of the workflow.

A file can match more than one guide: Lean test modules get both Lean checklists. A routing bullet lists the concrete globs, followed by the exclusions that apply to it.

## Shebang Rule

An extensionless file is a script of the language its first line names. Read the interpreter from `#!/usr/bin/env NAME`, `#!/usr/bin/env -S NAME ...` or `#!/path/to/NAME`, ignoring trailing flags. The shebang overrides the file extension.

- `bash` selects `write-bash-scripts`.
- `zsh` selects `write-zsh-scripts`.
- `sh`, `dash` and `ksh` match no guide. Report those files as unsupported rather than applying the Bash checklist, which would push Bash-only syntax into POSIX scripts.

When either shell guide is installed, the entry skill's reporting rules include the line telling reviewers that a script without a file extension follows its shebang, so scripts added later are routed too.

## write-go-code

- **Detect**: A tracked `go.mod`.
- **Route**: `**/*.go`.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-go-code.md`

## write-lean-code

- **Detect**: A tracked `lakefile.toml`, `lakefile.lean` or `lean-toolchain`, or any tracked `*.lean` file.
- **Route**: `**/*.lean`.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-lean-code.md`

## write-lean-tests

- **Detect**: A Lean project whose lakefile names a test library, and a tracked directory with that name at any depth. The lakefile names it through a test driver, `testDriver = "NAMETest"` in `lakefile.toml`, or `testDriver := "NAMETest"` or a `@[test_driver]` attribute on the library in `lakefile.lean`, or through a `lean_lib` whose name ends in `Test`.
- **Route**: `**/*.lean`, which covers the test directory and the test library's root module, for example `ShannonTest/**/*.lean` and `ShannonTest.lean`, and the library modules they mirror. The library files are routed here because the checklist's first rule is that a change to an exported declaration updates its mirrored test module, which a reviewer can only apply while looking at that change. A Lean file therefore carries both Lean checklists.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-lean-tests.md`

## write-bash-scripts

- **Detect**: Tracked `*.sh` or `*.bash` files, and any other tracked file whose shebang names Bash, whether or not it has an extension.
- **Route**: `**/*.sh` and `**/*.bash`, plus every other Bash script by path, or a directory glob such as `bin/*` when every file in the directory is a Bash script. A `*.sh` or `*.bash` file that the exclusion below removes is named in the exclusions of this guide's routing bullet, so the glob does not carry it.
- **Exclude**: Files whose shebang names another shell, including a `*.sh` or `*.bash` file that does.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-bash-scripts.md`

## write-zsh-scripts

- **Detect**: Tracked `*.zsh`, `*.plugin.zsh` or `*.zsh-theme` files; zsh startup files (`.zshrc`, `.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, `.zlogin`, `.zlogout`, with or without the leading dot); files whose first line is `#compdef` or `#autoload`; and any other tracked file whose shebang names zsh, whether or not it has an extension.
- **Route**: `**/*.zsh` and `**/*.zsh-theme`, plus each startup file, completion function and other zsh script by path, or a directory glob when every file in the directory is zsh. A `*.zsh` file that the exclusion below removes is named in the exclusions of this guide's routing bullet.
- **Exclude**: Files whose shebang names another shell, including a `*.zsh` file that does.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-zsh-scripts.md`

## write-scrut-tests

- **Detect**: A tracked `tests/scrut/` directory, or tracked Markdown files containing a code fence whose info string starts with `scrut`.
- **Route**: `tests/scrut/**/*.md`, plus each other Markdown file with a scrut fence by path.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-scrut-tests.md`

## write-markdown

- **Detect**: Any tracked `*.md` file that is neither a scrut test file nor Pandoc-academic Markdown.
- **Route**: `**/*.md`, followed by its exclusions.
- **Exclude**: Scrut test files, which the scrut checklist covers, and Pandoc-academic Markdown, which the Markdown checklist would misjudge. Treat a project as Pandoc-academic when it has `references/papers/`, `references/extractions/` or `references/transcriptions/`, or `papers/**/main.md` beside `papers/shared/templates/*.latex`; exclude those trees. Also exclude individual files with `bibliography:` or `csl:` in their frontmatter, `[@key]` citations in prose, or raw `{=latex}` blocks. A citation shown inside inline code or a code block, such as documentation of the citation syntax, is not a signal. Report the excluded Pandoc files as waiting on a Pandoc checklist.
- **Checklist**: `./references/checklists/write-markdown.md`
