# Lock-Free Buffers

Start with a protocol contract, not an atomic type: producer and consumer counts, owner of every storage location, publication and reuse points, capacity, maximum callback work, overflow rule, reclamation thread, and stalled-participant behavior. FIFO delivery of admitted events and latest-value or snapshot semantics are distinct products. A finite queue cannot guarantee lossless delivery under unlimited offered load.

## Legal Snapshots

A display may skip a frame, but a post-copy cursor check does not make a concurrent plain-data copy legal in C++ or Rust. A second cursor check and a larger history buffer can reduce visible tearing; neither repairs the data race or covers writes in progress after the last publication. A conventional plain-payload seqlock is therefore not portable C++ or Rust code.

Use one of these protocols instead:

- Transfer owned fixed blocks through a bounded SPSC channel.
- Protect double or triple buffers with an ownership state and a consumer-to-producer reuse acknowledgment.
- Use an atomic payload only after proving its coherence, ordering, target support, and capacity rules.

fosforo's [history ring](https://github.com/cboone/fosforo/blob/1317e2b752f7f7d44db9bb7745200ca6e59dde83/src/dsp/ring.zig) records an acknowledged lapping limitation. Its post-copy `coherent` predicate is a display decision under its assumptions, not a portable proof that sample access is race-free. Do not exclude a production-reachable race to obtain a clean experiment.

## Recommended Owned-Block Transfer

The following SPSC state table describes one bounded transfer. It requires one producer and one consumer. A worker turning into an extra producer invalidates that premise.

| State       | Owner    | Producer action                        | Consumer action                | Synchronization and full behavior                                               |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `free`      | Producer | Fill one block                         | None                           | Reuse only after consumer acknowledgment                                        |
| `published` | Consumer | Release-publish ownership state        | Acquire-observe that state     | If no `free` block exists, apply the documented drop, coalesce, or defer policy |
| `consuming` | Consumer | Do not overwrite                       | Read the block                 | Work is bounded by the block's fixed capacity                                   |
| `returned`  | Producer | Acquire the acknowledgment, then reuse | Release-publish acknowledgment | The acknowledgment is the reverse edge that authorizes reuse                    |

Bound drain batches. “Drain until empty” can be unbounded when a concurrent producer continues publishing. Derive capacity from product requirements, report rounding, define writes larger than capacity, and route reset or clear through a valid ownership transition. Overwriting a published payload behind a cursor is not a clear operation without ownership or atomic access.

## Progress, Topology, and Costs

Lock-free describes system-wide progress. It does not promise a fixed number of steps for one callback. In Rust, use an atomic type only when that width is available and lock-free for the selected target; a particular operation can still retry. For C++ and other APIs, check width, alignment, and target guarantees. State counter-wrap arithmetic, capacity assumptions, stale-handle behavior, and any ABA-related risk. SPSC is a topology constraint, not a proof that those concerns disappear.

A bounded enqueue is not the whole submission path. Audit payload construction, copy or move, success notification, rejected-payload destruction, and last-reference release separately. A render worker can turn an apparent SPSC route into multi-producer traffic. If preparation is late or a consumer stalls, keep the last valid configuration or follow the documented product policy without making callback progress depend on background progress.

## Events and Immutable Replacements

When accepting an event creates a future termination or cancellation obligation, reserve room for that obligation or reject the start before it is emitted. Dropping the newest event can discard a note-off. A planned 256-entry scheduler in springer is a project choice, not a portable capacity or proven overload policy. On an output `try_push` failure, retain the obligation for the next valid opportunity without unbounded retrying.

Prepare immutable replacements away from the callback. A pointer swap alone does not provide safe reclamation. Define reader acknowledgment, bound the retirement backlog, and defer new off-thread updates when retirement capacity is exhausted. Reference counting requires special scrutiny because a rejected operation or pointer replacement can run final destruction on the callback.

fosforo's [combined close flag and active count](https://github.com/cboone/fosforo/blob/1317e2b752f7f7d44db9bb7745200ca6e59dde83/src/clap/gate.zig) are one teardown protocol. Its closing loop spins and yields on the closing thread; completion depends on participants being scheduled and exiting. Keep that wait outside an audio callback. A mutex does not inherently create a check-then-enter race: define the state transition and the permitted waiting thread for the selected critical section.

## Review Cases

Validate block reuse, overwrite attempts, a stalled consumer, bounded drain batches, retirement exhaustion, notification cost, and payload destruction after rejected enqueue. Report the protocol's producer and consumer topology, all full-capacity behavior, and any unverified target-specific atomic guarantee.

### Example: Three Display Blocks

One callback producer and one UI consumer own three fixed 256-sample blocks. Use the Rust `AtomicU8` per-slot handshake from [memory ordering](memory-ordering.md): each block starts in state `0` (producer-owned), the producer release-stores `1` after filling it, and the consumer acquire-observes `1`, copies at most 256 samples, then release-stores `2` to that same atomic. The producer acquire-observes `2` and stores `0` before rewriting that block. The callback examines at most one block's state and publishes at most one block; the UI examines at most one block and returns it after copying. Each participant advances its own local round-robin block selection after a successful transfer. A state that does not permit that participant's next action leaves its selection unchanged until a later callback or UI poll. Neither participant retries in the same call.

The consumer's own return store prevents a later load from reading the old publication of that block, by the same-atomic write-read coherence proof in the linked example. A reused block index in a separate publication atomic does not provide this handshake. A slot remains consumer-owned from publication through completion of the copy; no payload reference escapes that copy.

When the selected block is consumer-owned, including when all blocks are consumer-owned, the callback increments an atomic dropped-frame counter and retains the previously published display value. It neither scans other blocks nor posts a notification. The counter requires a target with the chosen atomic width available and lock-free; audit the increment operation's progress separately. The UI polls the counter. A test trace holds all three blocks, verifies that a fourth callback does not overwrite one, returns the selected block, and verifies that only that returned block becomes reusable. This establishes the stated SPSC transfer and bounded overflow policy; a worker producer or a reference-counted payload would require a different protocol and cost audit.
