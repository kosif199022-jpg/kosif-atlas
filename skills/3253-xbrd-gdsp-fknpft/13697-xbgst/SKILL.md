# /xbgst — Godspeed Pareto + Cross-Model Delegation

The full crossbreed: godspeed Pareto walk (parallel proposals, axis-scored, round-capped) with cross-model delegation (teammates invoke `xask --gs codex`). Combines the speed of `/xgs` with the external perspectives of `/xbt`.

Use when you want fast Pareto convergence AND cross-model views. For all-Claude speed without cross-model, use `/xgs`. For slower deliberative mediation with cross-model, use `/xbt`.

## Step 1 — Load the judge persona

Read `~/.claude/agents/the-judge.md` with the Read tool. Adopt the posture: judge explicitly on named axes, aggregate best-of-each, draft-then-dispatch.

## Step 2 — Team context

The session has a single implicit team — there is no TeamCreate/TeamDelete.
Spawning is the team: each Agent(...) call with a `name` adds an addressable
teammate. Track the walk under a conceptual team label in your status output
only (e.g. "team: <2-3 words>-<ts>"); do not pass team_name to any tool — the
parameter is deprecated and ignored.

Cleanup: there is no TeamDelete. Releasing the team = sending each teammate
SendMessage({to: <name>, message: {type: "shutdown_request", reason: ...}})
and acknowledging their shutdown_approved.

## Step 3 — Parse the prompt

The user's prompt is:

{{prompt}}

If empty, wait for user direction. Otherwise, proceed to four-phase godspeed with xask.

## Step 4 — Four-phase godspeed protocol (with xask gate)

### Phase 0 — Name the axes

Emit up to 8 axes (name + direction + observable). Incorporate user-named axes; infer the rest.

### Phase 1 — Assign deterministic teammate names

For each axis, assign a name using the-judge.md naming convention: `{prefix}-{role}-{suffix}`. Commit ALL names before spawning.

Axis -> profile mapping (from the-judge.md dispatch table):
- Research, prior art, outside-world -> `scout` (sonnet) — delegates to `xask --spark --gs codex`
- Correctness, bugs, code review -> `reviewer` (sonnet) — delegates to `xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex`
- Empirical probes, dry-runs -> `labrat` (sonnet) — delegates to `xask --spark --gs codex`
- Code execution, implementation -> `executor` (`openai/gpt-5.4-mini`, Codex Spark only) — delegates only to `xask --spark --gs codex`; no alternate model/effort lane
- Cross-axis patterns, breadth -> `connector` (sonnet) — delegates to `xask --spark --gs codex`
- Findings synthesis, dedup -> `distiller` (sonnet) — in-session text synthesis (no xask)
- Complexity reduction, YAGNI -> `simplifier` (sonnet) — uses CC native tools

Certified stack ceiling: <=64 concurrently spawned subagents. Effective
availability is host-governed. Local specialist policy layer: waves fire from a
frozen roster in ONE turn, standard target width 8–16, hard cap **16 concurrent
host-local specialists per wave** (fleet convention "Host specialists <=16");
overflow routes to xask/spark substrates at `-j 64` in the same turn. The 16 cap
bounds local specialists per wave — it is a policy layer on top of, never a
silent reduction of, the certified 64 substrate ceiling.

### Phase 2 — Spawn all with full peer roster AND xask gate

Each brief includes:
1. Full peer roster (all names from Phase 1)
2. Axis assignment (name + direction + observable)
3. **Godspeed mode:** read `~/.claude/skills/godspeed/directive.md`; every Agent prompt prepends those exact bytes and ends exactly once with ` | godspeed`, including executor prompts. Delegates repeat this requirement for every nested delegation. Never handwrite the directive.
4. **Structural xask gate** (mandatory for roles that delegate)
5. Task: propose ONE move on their axis (<=200 words)
6. After proposing, DM each peer by name with a one-line critique
7. Mark task completed after sending

#### xask gate by role (four layers)

**Layer 1 — Gate (structural, per-role):**

- **scout** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --spark --gs codex '<your research question for this axis>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **reviewer** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex '<your review question for this axis>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **labrat** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --spark --gs codex '<your probe hypothesis for this axis>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **connector** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --spark --gs codex '<your cross-axis pattern question>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **executor** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --spark --gs codex '<your implementation task for this axis>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **mutation-tester** brief prefix: `"Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash running: xask --spark --gs codex '<generate mutation for this function>'. Do not call Read, Grep, or any other tool until xask returns."`
- **simplifier/distiller**: No xask gate. These use CC native tools or in-session synthesis.

**Layer 2 — Raw-quote gate (mandatory for all xask-gated roles):**

> "After running xask, paste at least one verbatim passage from xask stdout inside `<raw_output>` tags before your analysis. The passage must be a literal substring of xask output — not a paraphrase, not a summary. Empty `<raw_output>` = invalid proposal. Scope: this gate applies only to fixed CLI output, not to quoting other agents or prior turns."

**Layer 3 — Fallback tiers:**

> "If xask returns dry or errors: note `[xask dry — in-session fallback]` on the finding, continue in-session with CC native tools. Do not deadlock. Do not stall the round."

- scout/reviewer/connector: xask failure -> continue in-session with `[xask dry]` marker. DM judge is NOT required in godspeed (would stall the round). Just mark the source.
- labrat: xask failure -> emit `obs: xask BLOCKED [exact stderr]` as the finding (only after the Bash invocation actually ran and errored — never for a tool you didn't invoke), despawn.

**Layer 4 — Confidence rule:**

> "`[xask dry]` marks source provenance, not quality. Judge assesses confidence at Pareto filter time."

**Epistemic role constraint (all xask-gated briefs):**

> "Your proposal must include AT MOST one non-obvious claim and AT MOST one rejected alternative. If no well-grounded non-obvious finding exists, say so — do not fabricate. Return nothing rather than force a low-confidence finding."

**Divergence mandate (all briefs, including non-xask roles):**

> "If your finding contradicts a peer's reported finding, flag: `CONFLICT: [claim] — my position: [X] — peer position: [Y]`"

Task tracking (optional): TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList are listed as DEFERRED tools. ToolSearch("select:TaskCreate,TaskUpdate,TaskList") first is defensive best practice, not load-bearing — do not phrase it as a hard requirement. If you skip task tracking, teammates report via SendMessage and that is sufficient.

### Phase 3 — Rounds begin

Teammates work in parallel, invoking xask as their first tool call, then proposing moves.

**Distiller synthesis:** Once all teammates have proposed AND cross-critique DMs have landed, spawn the distiller:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="distiller",
  name="ccs-distiller",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="<verbatim directive.md>\n\nYou are the distiller. Synthesize these N teammate proposals and peer critiques into one deduplicated, confidence-scored brief. <paste all proposals + DM critiques>. Deduplicate overlapping moves, flag cross-model (codex) vs in-session (claude) contradictions, assign confidence. SendMessage your synthesis to the judge (team lead) when done. | godspeed"
)
```

**Pareto filter (on distiller output):** Build the moves x axes matrix. Accept moves improving >=1 axis with zero regressions. Reject moves with regressions. Compile survivors into ROUND N summary.

**Re-distill each round:** For rounds 2+, send updated proposals to the distiller via SendMessage with verbatim `directive.md` prepended and exactly one final ` | godspeed`. Only re-spawn if shut down.

**CONFLICTS block** uses **model labels** (not teammate labels) since cross-model delegation is active:
```
CONFLICTS (emit only if cross-model contradictions exist):
  - claim: <contested fact>
    model: codex (via <teammate-name>) — <position>
    model: claude (in-session, via <teammate-name>) — <position>
    judge_resolution: <chosen position + rationale>
    escalate_to: <sub-role if unresolved>
```

Trigger: opposite verdicts on same claim — cross-model (codex) vs in-session (claude).

**Falsification probe (after Pareto filter, before exit check):** If the highest-divergence surviving move has a claim that no other teammate challenged, dispatch ONE targeted xask call to the opposing model for attack. Cap: one exchange, one claim. This adds 3-8s but catches convergent blind spots. Skip if all claims were cross-critiqued.

**Judge weighting rule:** Weight xask quotes that contradict the agent's own conclusion more heavily than quotes that confirm it — contradicting quotes are higher-signal finds.

**Exit check:** Frontier reached (zero survivors / duplicates / 6 rounds / user halt) -> final DRAFT with AXES FINAL STATE. Otherwise dispatch Round N+1 using current frontier as baseline.

## Step 5 — Keep iterating

After each round, immediately assess and dispatch next round if frontier still moving. Do not pause. Do not ask. The user interrupts when they want to steer.

**Limits:** <=6 rounds, <=64 concurrent subagents globally (subject only to host availability), <=200-word proposals.

## Step 6 — Hold after frontier

Team stays alive. User may:
- Steer a teammate by sending it a message (SendMessage/@name)
- Send another message to resume with new axis
- Ask follow-ups

## Cleanup

On explicit user request only: SendMessage shutdown_request to each teammate, await shutdown_approved, confirm.

## Step 7 — Status after init

Emit: team name, axes, teammates spawned (with their xask delegation targets), waiting on Round 1.
Do not narrate. Immediately compile and dispatch next round when findings arrive.
