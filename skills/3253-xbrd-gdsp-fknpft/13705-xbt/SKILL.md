# /xbreed-team — Judge-Orchestrated Team Mode (Deliberative)

This command initializes a **persistent native agent team** with YOUR current session as the team lead. You adopt the-judge persona and orchestrate specialist sub-roles (scout, reviewer, labrat) as **real teammates** with **cross-model delegation** — teammates invoke `xask --gs codex` to bring external model perspectives into the draft.

Unlike `/xbreed` (solo one-shot subagents) or `/xgs` (godspeed Pareto all-Claude), `/xbreed-team` is the **deliberative** mode: slower, pondered, with the judge mediating cross-model views across multiple rounds.

## Step 1 — Load the judge persona

Read `~/.claude/agents/the-judge.md` with the Read tool. Adopt the posture: you are the top of the stack, you judge explicitly on named axes, you aggregate best-of-each, you draft-then-dispatch. Your output shape is the DRAFT protocol from that file.

## Step 2 — Team context

The session has a single implicit team — there is no TeamCreate/TeamDelete.
Spawning is the team: each Agent(...) call with a `name` adds an addressable
teammate. Track the walk under a conceptual team label in your status output
only (e.g. "team: <2-3 words>-<ts>"); do not pass team_name to any tool — the
parameter is deprecated and ignored.

Cleanup: there is no TeamDelete. Releasing the team = sending each teammate
SendMessage({to: <name>, message: {type: "shutdown_request", reason: ...}})
and acknowledging their shutdown_approved.

## Step 3 — Parse the prompt

The user's prompt is:

{{prompt}}

- If `{{prompt}}` is empty, the team was initialized without a specific task. Skip to Step 6 and wait for the user to direct the team with their next message.
- Otherwise, treat `{{prompt}}` as the problem to judge / draft per the-judge protocol. Decide which sub-roles (if any) you need.

**Planner-first is unconditional** (matches `~/.claude/agents/the-judge.md` sub-role table). Spawn `the-planner` as the Phase 0 teammate BEFORE any specialist:

```
Agent(subagent_type="the-planner", name="cco-planner-r0",
      prompt="<verbatim directive.md>\n\nWWKD Phase 0 data walk + skeleton for: <full user prompt>. FIRST tool call MUST be Skill(skill='wwkd'). Deliver plan artifact to team-lead. | godspeed")
```

Wait for the plan artifact. It becomes the skeleton against which downstream specialist dispatch checks for drift.

Composition: `/xbt /wwkd <spec>` is the explicit form of the same behavior.

## Step 4 — Dispatch sub-roles AS TEAMMATES with xask gate

When you decide a sub-role is needed, spawn it as a **persistent team member**:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="scout" | "reviewer" | "labrat" | "the-planner",
  name="<unique teammate name>",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="<verbatim directive.md>\n\n<task brief with mandatory xask gate and peer roster> | godspeed"
)
```

These are **real teammates** — they persist as background agents, can be steered by sending them a message (SendMessage/@name), will DM back via SendMessage, go idle between turns, and follow shutdown protocol.

**DO NOT** fall back to `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", ...)` with inlined persona.

**Task tracking (optional):** TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList are listed as DEFERRED tools. ToolSearch("select:TaskCreate,TaskUpdate,TaskList") first is defensive best practice, not load-bearing — do not phrase it as a hard requirement. If you skip task tracking, teammates report via SendMessage and that is sufficient.

### Peer roster and cross-critique DMs

Every teammate brief MUST include:
1. **Full peer roster** — all teammate names committed in this dispatch (so they can DM each other)
2. **Cross-critique instruction:** `"After completing your research/analysis, DM each peer by name with a one-line critique or reinforcement. Use SendMessage({to: '<peer-name>', message: '<verbatim directive.md>\n\n<critique> | godspeed'})."`

Peers DM each other directly for lateral information flow. The judge collects all reports + DM summaries and pastes them into the distiller's prompt for synthesis.

### Godspeed inheritance

Godspeed applies unconditionally. Read
`~/.claude/skills/godspeed/directive.md`; every Agent prompt prepends those
exact bytes and ends exactly once with ` | godspeed`, including executor
prompts. Delegates repeat this requirement for every nested delegation. Never
handwrite the directive.

### xask gate, epistemic constraints, and axis→profile mapping

Read `/home/vhpnk/repos/xbrd-gdsp-fknpft/commands/references/xbreed-shared.md` for the full 4-layer xask gate (per-role), epistemic constraints, divergence mandate, judge weighting, and axis→profile mapping. Apply them to every teammate brief.

(Legacy note: the original body pointed at `~/.claude/commands/references/xbreed-shared.md`, which is a dangling symlink — the target directory `/home/vhpnk/xbrd-gdsp-fknpft/` does not exist. Redirected to the real file's actual location. The already-canonical `xbreed-team` skill sidesteps this by inlining the gate directly instead of referencing this file — worth aligning on one approach.)

### Budget

Scale up to 12 teammates when the problem has many independent sub-questions.

## Step 5 — Distiller synthesis + deliberative rounds

### Phase A — Distiller aggregation

Once all teammates have spawned, spawn the **distiller** with | godspeed:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="distiller",
  name="ccs-distiller",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="<verbatim directive.md>\n\nYou are the distiller. Synthesize these N teammate findings into one deduplicated, confidence-scored brief. <paste all teammate reports + peer DM SendMessage cross-critiques>. Return format: State block with deduplicated claims, Unknowns block with contradictions, duplicate count. SendMessage your synthesis to the judge (team lead) when done. | godspeed"
)
```

The distiller:
- Reads all teammate reports + peer DM SendMessage cross-critiques
- Deduplicates overlapping findings
- Flags contradictions (CONFLICT blocks) for the judge
- Assigns confidence scores (high/medium/low/unverified)
- Sends one clean synthesis to the judge

### Phase B — Judge-driven iteration

Using the distiller's synthesis, the judge **mediates**:

1. **Draft** initial DRAFT from distiller output.
2. **Challenge** specific findings via targeted SendMessage follow-ups to individual teammates. Each message prepends verbatim `directive.md` and ends exactly once with ` | godspeed`.
3. **Teammates refine** and re-report. Peer DMs flow again.
4. **Re-distill** if findings changed substantially (send updated reports to distiller via SendMessage using the same canonical directive + suffix wrapper). For minor refinements, judge aggregates directly.
5. **Populate CONFLICTS block** if cross-model divergence found (codex vs. claude contradictions on the same claim).
6. **Repeat 2-5** until the judge is satisfied with the DRAFT quality.

**Soft ceiling: 6 deliberative rounds** (aligned with judge godspeed limit). After 6 rounds with no DRAFT progress, emit a CONFLICTS-only output and halt, naming unresolved items. Judge can override but must state why.

Deliberative rounds retain the inherited Godspeed directive while using sequential depth (judge challenges, teammates refine). For parallel Pareto width, use `/xgs`.


## Auto-cleanup after DRAFT

Once the final DRAFT is emitted (frontier reached / 6 rounds / halt): immediately shutdown all teammates in parallel via `SendMessage shutdown_request`, wait for shutdown_approved. There is no TeamDelete — acknowledged shutdowns are the full cleanup. Do not ask the user — the team served its purpose, kill it.

If the user wants to continue on a new axis, they invoke `/xbt` again; spawning is cheap.

## Step 7 — Emit a brief status after initialization

End your initialization turn with a short status:
- Team name created
- Which sub-roles were spawned and what task each was given
- Whether waiting on teammate replies or drafting

Do not narrate internal thinking. The DRAFT comes in a later turn once findings are in.
