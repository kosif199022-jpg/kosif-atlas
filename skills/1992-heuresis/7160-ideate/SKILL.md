# Heuresis Protocol

Resolve an underexpanded candidate field through frame-parallel divergent generation, widening it in width and in depth, without ever eliminating, ranking, or selecting among the candidates it produces. Type: `(CandidateFieldUnderexpanded, User, DIVERGE, IdeationRequest) → DiverseCandidateField`.

## Definition

**Heuresis** (εὕρεσις): the act of finding or discovering — a dialogical act of widening a candidate field that is empty or has prematurely converged, before any selection is made. Divergent and convergent thinking are distinct cognitive operations (Runco & Acar, 2012), and no protocol in this catalog carries a typed guarantee to generate the object-level alternative set itself — heuresis sits at the point where the candidate field itself is thin. On a blank entry, heuresis opens an abstract frame map before showing any concrete idea — early concrete examples measurably narrow independent generation (Wadinambiarachchi et al., 2024), and ideating before seeing a model's ideas preserves ownership and yields ideas less similar to the model's own (Qin et al., 2025). Generation is frame-parallel and never eliminates, ranks, or scores: selection is a downstream act, out of this protocol's scope. The field grows two ways — a new frame widens it, a branch dug under an open frame or candidate deepens it — and every round redraws the whole field as one map, so where the person stops is a checkpoint a later run can resume from.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

invariant: frame map first                    -- on a Blank entry no concrete candidate precedes the person's choice of frames
invariant: Divergence over Selection          -- nothing is eliminated, ranked, scored, or chosen; selection is outside this protocol
invariant: width and depth both widen         -- a new frame or a branch under an open frame or candidate; the map shows each branch's place
invariant: dissent rides the field            -- unaddressed signals, unexplored frames, and your contrary grounds stand before every gate and in the result

    preceding message as the utterance. -/
abbrev IdeationRequest (P : Type) := Context P

/-- **Your reads**: when the latest of the person's turns — the bound request, or an answer at any
    gate — names a record outside the session, such as an issue or a document, that record, read
    by a tool. Nothing the person does not name is read, and nothing wider is scanned. Empty when
    the turn names none. -/

/-- **Your reading** of the bound request: its topic. -/
axiom topic : Context P → String

/-- A fragment the request brings before any frame holds it, and where it came from: `person` for
    the person's own fragments. Material a named reference supplied keeps the origin it already
    carries as a tag, or else the origin of the turn it was read from — `external` for a record a

    different paths: the frame map first, or a first pass. -/
inductive Entry
  | blank

/-- **Your reading** of the bound request: which entry it is — inferred, never asked. The
    classification relay states it with its basis, why the field reads thin, and the signals. -/
axiom entry : Context P → Entry

inductive SignalSource | utterance | chain

/-- A concern, weakness, or requirement the person holds, and whether it came from their words or
    from named material. Never a quality score, an elimination reason, or a rank. -/
structure Signal where
  content : String
  source  : SignalSource

/-- **Your reading**, from the context as it now stands: the concerns the bound request and named
    material carry, and any the person voiced later in the run — a constraint added at a gate is a
    signal from then on. Nothing is fixed at entry, and none is dropped while the person's words
    still hold it. -/
axiom signals : Context P → List Signal

/-- A partition for parallel generation: a frame, or a branch dug under an open frame or under a
    candidate, `parent` naming that frame's label or that candidate's content. It organizes
    divergence only and is never handed off as a framed inquiry. -/
structure Frame where
  label  : String
  angle  : String
  parent : Option String

/-- **Your record**, read from the context: the frames and branches registered — derived from the
    entry, frames the person named at the frame map or at a round shaped into frames, and branches
    under what the person asked to deepen. On Seeded, at least one, seed-anchored and novel, every
    seed landing under one; on Blank, novel and abstract. When the request chains a field this
    protocol assembled, that field's frames and branches carry over as it stood at its Stop.
    Whether the person's words name a registered frame is read here. -/

axiom Opened : Context P → Frame → Bool

  request  : Cite c

/-- **Your reading** of every exclusion in the person's turns, each citing the turn that made it.
    A boundary the person states — "only this area" — reaches particular frames only once the
    person takes that application; until then it stands in `proposedExclusions`. An excluded frame
    is never deleted: it stays on the map marked out of scope with the turn quoted, and it is never
    widened. -/

/-- A generated idea: raw material for divergence, not a selection-ready alternative. It carries
    no score, rank, or preference. -/
structure Candidate where
  content : String
  frame   : Frame
  origin  : Origin

/-- **Your record**: every candidate the passes produced, under the frame or branch it came from —
    on a Seeded entry's first pass the seeds, each keeping its own origin, and every generated one
    as `assistant`; a chained field's candidates under their own frames and origins; the items of
    material the person names at a later turn under their frames, with their own origin —
    `external` for a tool read — at the pass after they are read. Never removed, re-ranked, or
    relabeled, an excluded frame's included. -/
axiom candidates : Context P → List Candidate

/-- **Your judgment**, remade at each presentation from the candidates and signals as they stand:
    the candidate responds to the signal. Never stored as a mapping and never a score on the
    candidate. Once the person stops, it stands as the presentation their Stop answered showed
    it; no reading after the Stop changes what they closed on. -/

structure ParkedFollowUp (c : Context P) where

    relayed with the request quoted. What the cited turn asks is your `supports` reading of it. A
    request to deepen is not a deferral: it opens a branch. -/
axiom parked : (c : Context P) → List (ParkedFollowUp c)

/-- **Your judgment**: your grounds against stopping here or against the field as it stands — a
    direction left unexplored that the topic points to, a signal no candidate answers, a branch
    thinner than its siblings. Shown before every gate; never a recommendation to continue or to
    stop, and never a rank on a candidate. -/
axiom dissent : Context P → List String

/-- **Your reading** of the latest answer: the frames the next pass opens — at the frame map, the
    frames selected and any the person named, shaped into frames; at a round, the named unexplored
    frames, a new angle shaped into frames, or a branch under an open frame or candidate the
    person asked to deepen. An excluded frame is never among them. A continue that names nothing
    takes every unexplored frame. On a
    Seeded entry's first pass, how many derived frames to open is yours; the rest stay unexplored
    and show as such. Empty when the answer opens nothing — a deferral alone, a question, a
    correction, a pick among candidates, or a continue with nothing left to open. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn closes the run this way, read against the context as it now
    stands. A pick among candidates, a judgment on one, or a correction does not by itself take the

/-! ── PHASE TRANSITIONS ──
A round is one step of a structural recursion over the person's utterances. `relay` is the
classification relay: the entry, its basis, why the field reads thin, and the signals with their
sources. `generate` is one pass: candidates under each frame the pass opens (`targets`), in
parallel over the frames, with the seeds promoted on a Seeded entry's first pass, and no
elimination, ranking, or scoring. On Blank, `respond` first presents the frame map and the gate
before any pass.

    unexplored frames, the frames out of scope marked as such with the person's turn quoted, your
    proposed exclusions marked as proposals, what is parked, every signal still unaddressed, and
    your contrary grounds — with what this round added marked. The map is re-read from the context, never stored; when it
    grows large it compresses to branches and counts while this round's additions show in full,
    the density yours to judge. Then what continuing would cost to review and what stopping keeps,

/-! ── LOOP ──
No fixed round count and no quota: nothing is tracked toward a target, and the loop goes on until
the person closes it. A basis-cited note on whether recent rounds read as closer to earlier ones
may sit before the gate; it describes state only and never reorders or discourages either answer.

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
field: the person's Stop with candidates; early: their Stop with none; withdrawn: they dropped the
ideation; routed: they named the next protocol. Their Stop is the completion itself, not a judgment
layered on a built object, and it takes the field with the map's dissent in view.
Convergence evidence: at DiverseCandidateField, present the trace — the topic, then the map: every
registered frame and its branches, each marked explored or unexplored, with every candidate under
the frame it sits in and its origin, the frames out of scope marked as such with the person's
turn quoted, the parked follow-ups with the requests quoted, the unaddressed signals, and your
contrary grounds; at EarlyExit, the frames offered, those out of scope, the parked follow-ups,
every signal, and your contrary grounds.

## Mode Activation

`/ideate` is user-initiated: an observation that a field looks narrow does not activate it. Selection and recommendation wait until the person's Stop produces `DiverseCandidateField` or `EarlyExit`.

## Protocol

### User-facing realization

Present the classification as a short basis-cited relay: the inferred entry, why the field reads thin, and source-tagged signals. For `Blank`, read `references/blank-entry.md` before presenting abstract frames and the pre-generation Stop path; for `Seeded`, read `references/seeded-entry.md` before the first pass. When named material supplied seeds or a chained field, also read `references/chain-reference.md` after classification and before the first pass.

Before every gate, present one map of the whole field — frames and the branches dug under them, candidates with their origins, unexplored frames, parked follow-ups, every signal still unaddressed, and your contrary grounds — with this round's additions marked. State the extra review load and what Stop will keep. At the Blank frame map the gate is the frame selector `references/blank-entry.md` carries. At every round gate, present continue first and stop second with symmetric specificity: continue opens unexplored frames, a new angle, or a branch under whatever the person asks to deepen; an answer that opens nothing presents the question again. Render Stop as `DiverseCandidateField` only when candidates exist and otherwise as `EarlyExit`.

Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when terminology must remain stable, wording must be carried unchanged, material belongs to another round or trace, or phase order determines placement around a gate.

## Known Limitations

- `unexplored_frames` covers derived frames, not every conceivable angle.
- A chain reference gives up the blank path's independent-ideation-first benefit; no mitigation is claimed.
- Signals are read from what the person said and the material they named; a concern never put into words is not among them.
- The rendered field carries the final unaddressed snapshot, not the full signal take/discard ledger; that ledger remains recoverable only from the round presentations the session context holds.

## Rules

- **User-initiated, zero entry questions**: `/ideate` activates only on direct invocation (Layer 1); `Entry` (Blank vs. Seeded) is inferred from the request alone — never asked. The classification is a relay, not a gate.
- **Frame-first ownership**: On `Blank`, read `references/blank-entry.md` before presenting abstract frames or any concrete candidate. Preserve every candidate's origin thereafter.
- **The person closes**: Stop, withdrawal, or a protocol the person names ends the run, and only the person's own turn does. A pick among candidates, a judgment on one, or a correction does not take the field; it is read for the frames it opens and the signals it adds, and the gate stays. Stop returns `DiverseCandidateField` only with candidates and otherwise the fully declared `EarlyExit`, and it closes on what the map it answered showed.
- **Out of scope, never erased**: A frame the person puts out of scope stays on the map with its branches and candidates, marked out of scope and citing their turn, and is never widened. Applying a boundary the person stated to particular frames is your proposal, shown as such, until the person takes it.
- **Named material only**: heuresis reads the request, material the person explicitly names at invocation or at any later turn — a prior protocol's output in the session, or a record outside it such as an issue or a document, read by a tool — and what the person says as the run goes on. A bare invocation binds the immediately preceding user message as the request (a one-turn U-BINDING rule, not a session scan). It never scans unnamed material — the wider session, codebase, or rules — and never reverse-traces hidden decision coordinates from externalized substrate; that is `/elicit`'s territory.
- **Chain semantics**: Named material folds in as seeds, each keeping the origin tag it carries or else the origin of the turn it was read from — `external` for a record a tool read; naming it is the person's adoption, recorded apart. A record named at a later turn is read then, and its items land under their frames with that origin at the next pass. A chained field this protocol assembled resumes: its frames, branches, and candidates carry over as the map stood at its Stop. Read `references/chain-reference.md` after classification and before the first pass; the ownership trade-off remains declared under Known Limitations.
- **Round composition**: Compose each round so the reader can act on it without reassembling it — everyday language rather than this file's formal vocabulary, the judgment set beside the evidence it rests on together with the differential implication that matters for the next move, and analytical context laid out before a gate rather than inside it, so the gate carries the question and each option's differential implication. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when a term's rendering has to hold across the session or wording has to be carried through unchanged, when some of what is in view belongs to a later round or a trace rather than this one, or when this protocol's own phases bear on where a sentence sits relative to a gate.
- **Width and depth both widen**: A request for more on an open frame or on one candidate opens a branch under it, registered with its parent, and the next pass fills it; nothing is ranked or chosen. Only what the person themselves sets aside for later parks, citing their turn, and is declared at either terminal.
- **One map every round**: The whole field is redrawn from the context before each gate, this round's additions marked; a large map compresses to branches and counts while the additions show in full.
- **Decision delta**: Before every gate, surface unaddressed signals, your contrary grounds, the explored/unexplored directional contrast, continuing's review cost, and what stopping keeps. Continue names its widening target and Stop names its live terminal.
- **Neutral option order**: At every round gate, Continue is always first and Stop second, with symmetric specificity. Any novelty or coverage observation, and every contrary ground, stays basis-cited pre-gate state and does not recommend or reorder either answer.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request; carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
