# iOS Take Screenshot

Produce exactly ONE image per requested screen. iOS has no full-page screenshot API — `screenshot` returns only the visible viewport — so a whole screen must be captured as slices and stitched. This skill owns that end to end: open the app, reach the screen, capture slices, stitch, delete the slices.

## Pick the Target First

Everything below has a real-device path and a simulator path. They differ in three places
only — how the app is found, how a session is set up, and which calls scroll and capture.
The stitcher, the output convention, the slice discipline, the settle rule, the
endless-list rule, cleanup and reporting are identical.

| | Real device | Simulator |
|---|---|---|
| App lookup | `devicectl` | `simctl` |
| Drive layer | appium-mcp | XcodeBuildMCP |
| Capture | `appium_screenshot` | `xcrun simctl io` |

Use the device when the request names one, when the app is only installed on a phone, or
when the point is how the app behaves on real hardware. Use the simulator when the app is
already running there, when no phone is connected, or when the request is about layout and
content rather than the device. If the request does not say and both are available, ask.

## Where Results Go

### Every name in this document is a value to paste, not a variable

Each command runs in its own shell, so a variable assigned in one command is empty in the
next. Where this document writes `$SLICE_DIR`, `$OUT_ROOT` or `$UDID`, it means
**the absolute value you were given, typed out in full** — or put the whole capture loop in a
single command. Getting it wrong fails quietly: an `if [ -z "${SLICE_DIR:-}" ]` guard mints a
new directory on every command, one slice in each, and the stitch succeeds on that single
slice and reports nothing wrong.

### Set the run up once

Run this one command and read the three values out of its output:

```bash
RUN_ID="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"
TMP="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"
SLICE_DIR="$(mktemp -d "${TMP%/}/ios-screenshot.XXXXXX")"
OUT_ROOT="${IOS_SCREENSHOT_DIR:-${TMP%/}/ios-screenshots}/$RUN_ID"
mkdir -p "$SLICE_DIR" "$OUT_ROOT"
printf 'RUN_ID=%s\nSLICE_DIR=%s\nOUT_ROOT=%s\n' "$RUN_ID" "$SLICE_DIR" "$OUT_ROOT"
```

The stitched PNG goes where the caller asks, via `--out`. `IOS_SCREENSHOT_DIR` only
takes effect if it is set in the shell that runs this command, so to use it, make
`IOS_SCREENSHOT_DIR=/some/dir` the first line of that same command. `RUN_ID` gives each run its own
subdirectory under it, so two sessions capturing the same screen cannot overwrite each
other, and it is also the name under which this run claims its simulator.

Each screen is then named for what it shows:

```
$OUT_ROOT/<app-slug>/<screen-slug>.png
```

Report the full path when you finish — a run-scoped directory is only useful to later tools
if they are told where it is. A path given in the request always wins over the default.

Set `IOS_SCREENSHOT_DIR` to the session's scratchpad directory when your system prompt names
one, and to a durable directory for screens worth keeping. With neither, the root falls under
`$TMPDIR`, which macOS clears.

Several agents can share that library safely; a phone or a simulator they cannot, so this
skill provides a lock: `claim-simulator.mjs` holds one UDID for one `RUN_ID`, and
`capture-slice.sh` refuses a simulator nobody has claimed. Neither target refuses a second
agent on its own. On a phone, WebDriverAgent serves one session, and a second Appium
session does not fail — it wins, and the first agent's next call fails with "Session does
not exist" mid-run. On a simulator, XcodeBuildMCP retargets its session default to whoever
set it last. So the second claim fails, and that agent chooses to wait or abort; with
several agents queued on one phone, waiting and claiming again is the normal path. On a
phone the plugin's `phone-session-gate` hook enforces the claim: `appium_session_management`
`create` is denied unless its capabilities carry `appium:udid`, that UDID is claimed, and no
session is recorded open on it. The hook cannot tell agents apart, so it stops a second
session, not a second driver on the holder's session. Several
sessions on several simulators is fine: each session has its own XcodeBuildMCP server and
its own defaults. The stitcher writes to a staging file and renames it into place, so a
reader never sees a half-written PNG, and its verdict reports `replaced_existing` when a
run overwrites an earlier capture of the same screen.

## Core Workflow

0. Discover the target and set up the session.
1. Open the app (find it first — the default device listing hides App Store apps).
2. Navigate to the requested screen and confirm you are on it by looking at a screenshot.
3. Scroll to the top, then capture overlapping slices downward, capped.
4. Stitch with `scripts/stitch_screens.py` and read its JSON verdict.
5. Delete the slices. Keep only the stitched PNG.

Keep slices in a run-specific temp dir, never under the skill folder.

## Tool Names

The plugin serves both MCP servers, so their tools carry its prefix. `appium_screenshot` is
`mcp__plugin_mobile_appium-mcp__appium_screenshot`, and `swipe` is
`mcp__plugin_mobile_xcodebuildmcp__swipe`. They are written unprefixed below for
readability.

Device-specific capabilities — UDID, team id, WebDriverAgent bundle id — are not in the
plugin config, since they differ per machine. Pass them inline to
`appium_session_management` (`action=create`), or point the server at a local
`capabilities.json` with `CAPABILITIES_CONFIG`. Do not ask the user for these values and
do not carry them between sessions — step 0 discovers them and prints them ready to use.

## Safety

On a real device you are driving someone's phone, often signed into a real account with
real money. A simulator has no real account behind it, but the same discipline keeps a
capture run honest and cheap, so follow it on both.

- Read-only. Never tap anything that transacts, sends, confirms, deletes, posts, or follows.
- Never type into a credential, seed-phrase, or payment field.
- Navigation, tab switching, and scrolling are fine. Anything that changes state is not.
- If a screen can only be reached by a state-changing action, stop and ask.

**Never tap a coordinate without a fresh screenshot showing what is under it.** An app
resumes on whatever screen it was last left on, so coordinates memorised from an earlier
run land somewhere else entirely. In one run, a remembered tab-bar position landed on a
payment button after the app reopened elsewhere, opening a checkout sheet. Screenshot,
look, then tap.

To dismiss a modal sheet, tap the dimmed backdrop above it. A downward swipe on the sheet
body often does nothing, and repeating it wastes turns.

## 0. Set Up the Target

### Real device

Discover the session values rather than asking for them or remembering them:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/discover-ios-setup.mjs"
```

It reports the connected devices, which provisioning profiles cover them, whether
WebDriverAgent is installed, and — when everything is in place — a `suggestedCapabilities`
object to pass straight to `appium_session_management` (`action=create`). Exit 0 means
ready; exit 1 lists what is missing. The UDID comes from the device list, the team id from
a profile that covers the device, and the WebDriverAgent bundle id from the runner already
installed on it.

**If WebDriverAgent is not installed, do not build it by hand.** Use
`appium_prepare_ios_real_device`:

1. Call it with no `provisioningProfileUuid` to list available profiles.
2. Call it again with the chosen UUID and `isFreeAccount` — false for a paid Apple
   Developer account, true otherwise. It downloads the matching WebDriverAgent release,
   packages it as an IPA, resigns it with that profile, and returns a `capabilitiesHint`.
3. Pass that hint to `appium_session_management` (`action=create`), serialising the whole
   object — do not drop its boolean or numeric values.

Before creating the session, claim the phone for this run, so no other agent opens a
session that ends yours:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/claim-simulator.mjs" "$UDID" --run "$RUN_ID"
```

Exit 0 means it is yours. Exit 3 means another run holds it; wait and claim again, since
there is no other phone to pick. Hold the claim across every screen of the flow and
release it at cleanup, after deleting the Appium session. The hook records the session id
in the claim when `create` succeeds, and clears it when `delete` succeeds.

Two switches live on the phone and cannot be set from the Mac. Developer Mode, which
`devicectl` does report, and **Settings -> Developer -> UI TESTING -> Enable UI
Automation**, which it does not report at all. Without the second, session creation fails
with a bare `xcodebuild failed with code 65`, and the real reason — "Timed out while
enabling automation mode" — appears only in the test log. Ask the user to turn both on, and
to leave the phone unlocked while a session runs.

A paid Apple Developer account re-signs WebDriverAgent yearly; a free Apple ID expires it
every 7 days, after which capture stops working until it is signed again.

### Simulator

There is no WebDriverAgent, no provisioning profile and no session to create. A booted
simulator is the whole requirement:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/discover-ios-setup.mjs" --target simulator
```

Exit 0 prints the booted simulators and a `sessionDefaults` object; exit 1 says either that
nothing is booted or that several are and it will not guess between them. Boot one with
`boot_sim` if none is running, and `open_sim` if you want to watch. With several booted,
choose one and run it again with `--device <udid>`; it then reports that one as selected.

Keep the chosen UDID — the `selectedSimulator.udid` from that report — and paste it into
every command that needs it, as above.

Then claim it for this run, so no other agent drives it while you capture:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/claim-simulator.mjs" "$UDID" --run "$RUN_ID"
```

Exit 0 means it is yours. Exit 3 means another run holds it, and the message says which
run and for how long. Decide: wait and claim again, or abort and pick another simulator.
Never `--steal` unless you know that run is dead. The claim is a file under `TMPDIR`, so
it is visible to every session of the same user; releasing it is part of cleanup.

Pass the `sessionDefaults` object to `session_set_defaults`, so every XcodeBuildMCP call
targets that simulator, then call `session_show_defaults` and check that `simulatorId` is
the UDID you claimed. The defaults belong to the XcodeBuildMCP server, which every agent in
this session shares, so they can already hold a different simulator, or a different
app's bundle id, set by an earlier agent, and nothing warns you. Set both and read both
back. None of `launch_app_sim`, `snapshot_ui`, `tap`, `swipe` or
`screenshot` takes a simulator of its own, whatever their `nextSteps` hints claim about a
`simulatorId` parameter; there is no per-call targeting. What each response does carry is
the simulator it hit, as `artifacts.simulatorId` (`udid` in a snapshot). Compare that with
the capture UDID whenever a screen seems not to move.

**The default and the capture UDID must agree.** XcodeBuildMCP scrolls whatever its
session default points at, while `simctl` captures whatever UDID you hand it; if they
differ you will swipe one simulator and photograph another, and the slices will look like a
screen that never moves. The stitcher refuses an identical pair for exactly this reason.

For the same reason, do not use `booted` as a stand-in for the UDID. `simctl` resolves it to
one running simulator without saying which, and simulators routinely hold different builds
of the same app — on one machine the same app was version 62 on one booted simulator and 64
on another. `claim-simulator.mjs` and `capture-slice.sh` refuse it outright.

## 1. Open the App

### Real device

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/find-ios-app.sh" --device <udid> --name <app name>
```

`xcrun devicectl device info apps` lists **only developer-installed apps by default** — an App Store app looks absent. The script passes `--include-all-apps`, which is the whole reason it exists. Do not call `devicectl` directly for this.

Foreground it with `appium_app_lifecycle` (`action=activate`, `id=<bundleId>`), then
screenshot. An app resumes where the user left it, not on its home screen, so confirm
where you actually are before navigating.

If no Appium session exists yet, create one: `select_device` (`platform=ios`, `iosDeviceType=real`, `deviceUdid=<udid>`), then `appium_session_management` with `action=create` and the discovered capabilities, which carry `appium:udid`. Sessions idle out. When a call fails with "Session does not exist", delete the session first (`action=delete`), then create again; the gate denies a create while the claim still records the old session.

### Simulator

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/find-ios-app.sh" --simulator "$UDID" --name <app name>
```

`devicectl` cannot see simulators at all, so this reads `simctl listapps` instead. The
script also accepts `booted`, but only when exactly one simulator is running — with several
up it refuses rather than answering about an arbitrary one.

Then `launch_app_sim` with that bundle id. The screen can stay blank for several seconds
after launch, so wait with `wait_for_ui` (`predicate: settled`) before the first screenshot,
then screenshot to see where the app resumed. A development build may resume on its dev
launcher — a list of servers, not the app. Pick the
running server from that list and dismiss any developer menu, then confirm the app itself
is on screen before going further.

## 2. Find the Requested Screen

Navigate by tab bar, search, or an element found with `appium_find_element` on a device, or
from a `snapshot_ui` target on a simulator. Prefer `accessibility id` over xpath.

Then **look at a screenshot and confirm you are on the right screen** before capturing. Do not assume a tap landed. This is the single most common way a capture run wastes its slices.

Not every visible row can be tapped by ref. On the simulator some list rows are exposed as
text rather than buttons, and tapping their ref fails with `TARGET_NOT_ACTIONABLE`; stock
Settings is like this below its first level. Reach such a screen another way, or pick a
different screen, rather than retrying the same ref.

## 3. Capture Slices

Read this section before your first scroll. These three facts cost an hour to learn:

- **`direction` is the direction the CONTENT moves, not the finger.** `direction=up` scrolls you FURTHER DOWN the page. To move toward the top of a page, use `direction=down`. This holds on both targets. Getting it backwards produces slices that look random and overlap measurements that read as "nothing moved".
- **Scoping matters, and a screen can hold several scroll views.** A bare gesture may not
  move the page at all, so every scroll must name a container.
- **One scoped scroll advances roughly a full viewport** at the default distance, which is
  too far. The stitcher joins slices by finding where they overlap, so a scroll that
  advances a whole screen leaves nothing to match on, and a short section between two
  slices is never photographed at all. Ask for about half a screen — `distance` 0.5 on the
  simulator — and let the stitcher measure the real offset. Measured on one screen:
  `distance` 0.7 advanced 1819px of a 2220px body, over 80%, while 0.3 advanced 770px and
  left a comfortable overlap. Do not hand-tune drag coordinates; scoped `direction` scrolls
  are far more reliable than custom `x/y/endX/endY` drags, which frequently move nothing.

A floating scroll-to-top button, where an app has one, returns to the top of the *list*, not the top of the *page*. Expect one more `direction=down` scroll to bring a header or chart back into view.

### Scrolling and capturing on a real device

Find a container with `appium_find_element` (`strategy=-ios class chain`,
`selector=**/XCUIElementTypeScrollView`) and pass its `elementUUID` to every scroll.
That selector returns the **first** match in hierarchy order, which is not necessarily the
one holding the content you want. It may scroll a different axis, or be nested, or be
inert. So after the first scroll, compare against the previous frame: if nothing moved,
try `**/XCUIElementTypeScrollView[2]`, then `[3]`, and so on. Exhausting them establishes
only that nothing moves the screen **vertically** — see below before calling the screen
one viewport tall.

`appium_screenshot` writes wherever the MCP server is configured to write (`SCREENSHOTS_DIR`, otherwise the working directory) and returns that path. It does not write into `SLICE_DIR`. Copy each returned file across as you go, named so a glob sorts in capture order:

```bash
cp "$RETURNED_PATH" "$SLICE_DIR/slice-$(printf '%02d' "$N").png"
```

Save slices at full resolution — do not pass `maxWidth` when capturing for a stitch, since downscaling loses the detail the overlap matcher needs.

### Scrolling and capturing on a simulator

**Do not capture slices with the XcodeBuildMCP `screenshot` tool.** It returns a downscaled,
lossy JPEG — 369x800 for a screen that is really 1179x2556 — whatever the file is named. It
is fine for looking at a screen; it destroys the detail the overlap matcher needs. Capture
with the wrapper instead, which writes a full-resolution PNG straight into `SLICE_DIR`, so
there is no copy step, and refuses a simulator this run does not hold:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/capture-slice.sh" --simulator "$UDID" --run "$RUN_ID" \
  --out "$SLICE_DIR/slice-$(printf '%02d' "$N").png"
```

Every script here prints its result as JSON on stdout; the one-line package note `uv`
prints on a first run goes to stderr, so parse stdout alone. Exit 0 prints the path it
wrote. Exit 2 is a bad argument, `booted` included. Exit 3 is a
simulator this run does not hold — unclaimed, or held by another run, which the message
names; that is not a retry, it is the one-agent-per-simulator rule.

Scroll with `swipe`, which requires `withinElementRef`. Get the first ref from
`snapshot_ui` — it lists scrollable targets. After every swipe, call `snapshot_ui` again
for the next ref. The swipe response carries a fresh snapshot only when the accessibility
tree settled in time, and on a live screen it rarely does: the usual response is the settle
warning described below, with no targets in it. If a swipe does return targets, use them
and skip the call.

Never reuse a ref across a swipe on the strength of it having worked before. A ref can go
stale once the screen moves, and a stale one fails with `TARGET_NOT_ACTIONABLE` or
`SNAPSHOT_MISSING`. A top-level container often keeps the same ref string for a whole
capture, and sometimes for a swipe or two before it changes, with nothing to say which
time is the last. Reading it fresh costs one call; a stale ref costs a failed swipe and a
snapshot anyway. On either error take a new snapshot rather than retrying the same ref.

No delay is needed between the swipe and the capture: by the time `swipe` returns, the
screen has stopped moving. Expect `swipe` to warn `SNAPSHOT_CAPTURE_FAILED` — "the
refreshed runtime snapshot did not settle" — on most calls; that is the norm on a busy
screen, and it is its accessibility tree timing out, not the rendering. Take a fresh `snapshot_ui` for the next ref and carry on; the pixels are fine.

`snapshot_ui` reports no geometry at all — no rect, no frame, no coordinates. Anything that
needs to know where a region sits must read it from the pixels instead. That is what
`--crop-band` on the stitcher is for; see the sideways capture below.

### One capture covers one axis

The loop below scrolls vertically, and the stitcher joins slices along that axis. Before
concluding a screen does not scroll at all, try a horizontal scroll on the same containers:

- **A screen that only scrolls sideways** — a wide table, a paged gallery — moves on the
  horizontal attempt. Capture it the same way, scrolling `direction=left` to advance, and
  stitch with `--axis horizontal`. Fixed chrome is then read off the left and right edges,
  so `--sticky-top` and `--sticky-bottom` mean left and right if you need to override them.
- **A screen that scrolls both ways** cannot become one image. Capture the vertical page as
  the main artifact, then capture any horizontally scrollable region as its own image named
  for that region. Do not try to assemble a two-dimensional mosaic: the overlap matcher
  aligns along a single axis, and a grid of slices gives it no consistent seam to find.

**A sideways region must be reduced to its own band before stitching.** A carousel occupies
a band; the rest of the screen holds still while it scrolls. Full-screen slices would be
mostly static, and static content matches at any offset, so the matcher splices confidently
in the wrong place. There are two ways to get the band, one per target:

- **Real device:** pass the container's `elementUUID` to `appium_screenshot` and the capture
  is cropped to that band. Find the container by shape rather than by guessing an index.
  Walk `**/XCUIElementTypeScrollView[1]`, `[2]`, … and read each one's geometry with
  `appium_get_element_attribute` (`attribute=rect`). A horizontal scroller is wide and
  short — full screen width, a fraction of its height — while a page container is nearly as
  tall as the screen. On one app this immediately separated a 393x118 carousel from the
  393x704 page container, with no trial-and-error scrolling.
- **Simulator:** there is no element-scoped capture and no geometry to crop to, so capture
  full screen and let the stitcher find the band: `--axis horizontal --crop-band`. It keeps
  the rows that change between slices, which is exactly the region that scrolled, and
  reports them as `cropped_band` in the verdict. Check that against the carousel you meant
  to capture.

Element captures can differ by a pixel between frames as the rect rounds; the stitcher trims
to the common size rather than rejecting the set.

Either way, say in the report which axis was captured and whether content extends past it.
A capture that silently drops the other axis reads as complete when it is not.

### Settle, then capture

**Let the screen settle before the first slice.** A screen captured mid-transition differs
from the same screen a moment later, and that difference is easily mistaken for scrolling.
Screenshot twice and compare; only start capturing once two consecutive frames are nearly
identical. Skipping this produced a run that captured one non-scrolling screen twice and
stitched a duplicate.

Name every throwaway frame — settle probes, the at-the-top check, the bottom marker —
outside the slice pattern, `probe-*.png` in `SLICE_DIR`, so the `slice-*.png` glob at
stitch time cannot pick one up. A probe that slips into the stitch is not always caught:
the stitcher refuses an identical pair, but a probe taken mid-transition is not identical
to anything.

Compare two frames with:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/frame_diff.py" <before.png> <after.png>
```

It prints `mean_abs_diff` on a 0-255 scale, and — more useful — `scrolled_px`, the offset
at which the later frame's content is found in the earlier one. It finds the fixed chrome
from the pair itself and reports it as `sticky_top` and `sticky_bottom`; pass those flags
only to override what it found. Do not reach for another tool: the system python has no
imaging library, and this script carries its own.

**Bound that wait to about three attempts.** A live feed never settles — its content keeps
arriving — so an unbounded settle loop waits forever. Tell the two apart by whether the
change decays: a transition drops to near zero within a second or two, while live content
holds a steady difference indefinitely. Once you have established it is live, capture
anyway and say so in the report.

Capture loop:

1. Scroll toward the top (`direction=down`) until the top no longer changes: capture a
   probe, swipe once more, capture another probe, and compare with `frame_diff.py`.
   `scrolled_px` 0 on that pair means you are at the top. An app usually resumes near the
   top of a tab, so this is often a single swipe.
2. Capture slice 1 — a fresh capture named as a slice, not one of the probes.
3. Scroll `direction=up` once → screenshot → next slice.
4. Repeat until the page stops moving, with a hard stop at **6 slices**.

"Nearly identical" means a `mean_abs_diff` below about 2 on settled frames.
Compare each new slice against the previous one:

- **Below 2 → stop.** The page did not move. That frame marks the bottom, it is not
  content: capture it as a probe, never as a slice, so nothing has to be deleted before the
  stitch.
- **If that happens on the very first scroll, the screen does not scroll at all.** One slice
  is the whole screen. Pass it alone to the stitcher, which copies a single slice through
  unchanged. Do not stitch a screen to itself.

The stitcher reports `vs_previous_diff` per seam, which separates "never moved" from "moved
but would not align" when a seam fails.

**A difference is not the same as movement.** A screen can be static and still differ
between frames: a net worth, a PnL, a claimable balance all tick on their own, so the raw
difference never reaches zero and the rule above reads as "it moved" forever. That is what
`scrolled_px` is for — it is 0 when nothing scrolled, whatever the values did, and a real
scroll reports the offset it found with a low `match_error`. Judge by that, not by the
difference alone. This is the same hazard as a live feed, in a milder form: there, whole
rows arrive; here, a few digits change in place.

**Infinite scroll: two screens is enough — one scroll.** An endless list has no bottom to
reach, and capturing more of it adds rows, not information. Such a list is usually already
partly visible on the first screen, so a single scroll reveals the next page of rows, and
the stitched image makes the endless section obvious. Stop there and report the capture as
truncated.

Two slices is also the one case where chrome detection has the least to work with. It
works by comparing slices, and with a single pair the first slice is half the evidence, so
where the app expands a large navigation title at the top of a page and collapses it once
the page moves, that band reads as content and the crop stops short of the title bar. A
compact title bar that does not change detects fine. When it does go wrong, the seam fails
loudly rather than silently — `all_spliced` is false and the slices are butt-joined. If
that happens on a two-slice capture, read the chrome height off a slice and pass
`--sticky-top` explicitly; do not reach for `--max-error`.

Judge which case you are in by what is advancing. Repeating rows of the same shape — a
comment thread, a feed, a search-results list — are an endless list: stop at two screens. Distinct
sections that each appear once — a description, a stats table, a footer — are finite page
content: follow them to the bottom.

**A live feed cannot be captured as one coherent page.** New rows arrive between slices, so
the stitched image is a composite of two moments rather than a snapshot of one: row ages
will not read in order, and a "new items" affordance may appear mid-image. Seam error also
runs close to the accept threshold, because no two frames of a live screen match cleanly.
Present such a capture as a composite, not as the state of the screen at one instant.

The stitcher trusts the order it is given; passing slices out of order produces a confidently wrong image.

## 4. Stitch

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/stitch_screens.py" \
  --out "$OUT_ROOT/<app-slug>/<screen-slug>.png" \
  --slices "$SLICE_DIR"/slice-*.png
```

The script auto-detects the fixed chrome (status bar, sticky header, pinned bottom bar), finds where each slice overlaps the previous one by sliding a textured band and minimising pixel difference, and splices at the matched row so duplicated content appears once.

It prints a JSON verdict. **Read it.** Every seam must say `"spliced": true`. A
`"butt_joined"` seam means no overlap was found and content may be missing at that seam.
It refuses outright, writing nothing, when two consecutive slices are identical: that is a
bottom marker that should have been dropped, or a swipe that hit a different simulator
than the capture. Fix the slices; do not pass the pair some other way.

Where that seam sits tells you what went wrong:

- **At the bottom of the page**, it usually means the last scroll hit the end and moved
  almost nothing. Check `vs_previous_diff`: near zero means the slice was not content and
  should have been discarded.
- **Mid-page**, the scroll overshot. One swipe advanced further than a screen, so the two
  slices do not overlap and whatever sat between them was never captured — the stitched
  image looks plausible and is missing a section. Recapture that stretch with a smaller
  `distance`, roughly half of what you used. This is the failure most likely to be
  mistaken for a good capture, because nothing about the image looks wrong.

**Do not chase a failing seam by raising `--max-error`.** Loosening the threshold does not
find a better alignment; it accepts a worse one. On a six-slice capture that failed one
seam, raising it made every seam report `"spliced": true` and produced an image a third
shorter than the page it came from, with the missing rows gone silently. When a seam fails,
the cause is almost always the chrome bounds, so check those first.

If `sticky_detected` in the verdict looks wrong, override it and re-run. Both flags take the **number of pixels** of fixed chrome at each edge, not row indices:

```bash
--sticky-top 362 --sticky-bottom 357
```

Read those off a slice: how tall is the status bar plus any pinned header, and how tall is the pinned bottom bar. Detection handles a pinned header that shows a live-updating value, because it measures the share of pixels in a row that change rather than the size of the change. It also ignores the first slice when three or more were captured, because iOS expands a large navigation title at the top of a page and collapses it as soon as the page moves — measuring that band against later slices reads it as content and crops short of it. With exactly two slices there is nothing left to measure once the first is set aside, so it is measured, and a screen whose title collapses after the first slice then needs `--sticky-top` passed by hand.

Verify the result by opening it and checking continuity across seams: ordered lists must stay ordered, and no row may repeat. On a dark UI a flat black band can match anywhere, so a low error score alone is not proof.

One thing the stitcher cannot remove: a button that floats over the page rather than
sitting flush with an edge. Chrome is detected at the top and bottom edges only, so a
floating action button is spliced in as content wherever it sits inside the part of a
slice the stitch keeps. Whether it repeats depends on where it floats and how far each
scroll advanced: one pinned near the bottom edge usually lands in the tail every splice
discards and shows once, while one over the middle can show once per slice. A repeat is a
property of the screen, not a bad stitch. Say so in the report rather than re-running.

A stronger check when a stitch looks suspect: the output height should be about the first
slice plus the sum of the scroll steps, minus the bottom chrome, which the first slice
carries and the stitch drops. If it is far short, content was dropped no matter what
`all_spliced` says.

That check only catches a bad splice, though. It cannot catch a bad butt join, which pads
in a whole untrimmed slice and so comes out *longer* than the arithmetic predicts even
while a section is missing. For a butt-joined seam there is no substitute for looking at
it: read the bottom of the earlier slice and the top of the next one, and ask whether
anything should sit between them.

## 5. Clean Up

Delete the slice directory, on a phone delete the Appium session, and release the claim.
A run that captures several screens keeps its claim until the last one; releasing between
screens only invites another agent in mid-run:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/ios-take-screenshot/scripts/claim-simulator.mjs" "$UDID" --run "$RUN_ID" --release
```

The stitched PNG is the only artifact that survives. Name it for what it shows — `settings.png`, `search-results.png`, `product-detail.png` — never `screenshot-1.png` or a timestamp.

Where a screen's own header and the tab that reaches it disagree — a tab bar reading
"Account" above a page headed "Portfolio" — name it for the header, which is what the image
shows. The app slug is the app's display name from `find-ios-app.sh`, lowercased, spaces to
hyphens: `MyApp` becomes `myapp`.

## Reporting

State the target, the output path, the number of slices, whether the capture was truncated by infinite scroll, and every seam's status. If any seam was butt-joined, say so plainly instead of presenting the image as complete.
