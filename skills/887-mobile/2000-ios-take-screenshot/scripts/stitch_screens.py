"""Stitch overlapping iOS screen slices into one full-screen PNG.

iOS screenshots capture only the visible viewport. Given slices taken while
scrolling down a screen, this removes the chrome that stays fixed on screen,
finds where each slice overlaps the previous one, and splices them so repeated
content appears exactly once.

Prints a JSON verdict. Every seam must report "spliced": true.
