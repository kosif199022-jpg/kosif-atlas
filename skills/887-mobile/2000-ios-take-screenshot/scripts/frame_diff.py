# ABOUTME: Compares two screenshots: the mean difference, and the offset at which the later frame is found
# ABOUTME: in the earlier one, so a page that scrolled is told from one that only carries a ticking value.
"""Compare two screenshots: how much they differ, and whether the page scrolled.

The capture loop turns on one question after every scroll — did the page move? —
and a raw difference cannot answer it on a screen that carries a live value. A
price that ticks between frames registers a difference while nothing scrolled,
and a short scroll near the bottom of a page registers about as much.

So this reports both: the mean absolute difference, and the offset at which the
later frame's content is actually found in the earlier one. A page that scrolled
has a non-zero offset with a low error at that offset. A page that only flickered
matches best at offset 0.

Fixed chrome must be left out of that search: a pinned header sits at the same
rows in both frames, so it matches at offset zero and outweighs the content
below it. Unless its height is given, it is detected from the pair the same way
the stitcher detects it.

Prints JSON.
