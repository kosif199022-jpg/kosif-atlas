description: Build or refresh the derived sqlite index over exported Claude Code, pi and dsh transcripts in the agent-transcripts cache. Use when the user wants to "index transcripts", "ingest transcripts into sqlite", or "refresh the transcript index". The database is derived and safe to delete; raw files stay canonical. Querying it is the transcript-query skill.

# transcript-ingest

Parses the raw transcripts the three export skills copied into the agent-transcripts cache
and writes one sqlite database beside them, so later analysis queries a single schema
instead of re-parsing three formats.

**The raw files are canonical; the database is derived.** Deleting it loses nothing — a
rebuild re-reads `raw/`. A parse failure is recorded against the file and does not stop the
run.

## The commands

```bash
# Index everything new or changed since the last run.
uv run --script ./transcripts.py ingest

# Start from an empty database (after a parser change).
uv run --script ./transcripts.py ingest --rebuild

# Flag standing-instruction boilerplate as `injected` (also auto-run at the end of ingest).
uv run --script ./transcripts.py annotate [--min-sessions N] [--exclude-role R]

# What is in the cache and the index.
uv run --script ./transcripts.py stats
```

Options: `--dest DIR` overrides the cache root (default `$AGENT_TRANSCRIPT_DIR`, else an
`agent-transcripts` directory inside the user's cache directory), matching the export
skills.

## Schema summary

`transcripts.db` sits beside `raw/`:

- `files` — one row per raw file: `harness`, `relpath` (unique), `size`, `mtime`,
  `parser_version`, `status`, `error`, `parsed_at`. A file is re-parsed when it is new, its
  size or mtime changed, or its recorded parser version is older than the current one.
- `sessions` — `harness`, `native_id`, the owning file, `cwd`, `project_key`, `kind`
  (`main` or `subagent`), `parent_native_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `model`, `title`.
- `messages` — per session: `ord`, `native_id`, `parent_native_id`, `on_main_path`, `role`
  (`user`, `assistant`, `tool_result`, `system`), `ts`, `text`, `model`, `stop_reason`,
  token counts, the original record as `raw`, and `injected`. The token counts are
  `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens`, as the
  harness reported them: every harness reports `input_tokens` **exclusive** of the prompt
  cache, so the prompt a turn actually processed is `input_tokens + cache_read_tokens +
  cache_write_tokens` (`NULL` cache columns mean the harness did not report them).
  `injected` is `1` for a message
  that is standing-instruction boilerplate — a `system` message, or any non-`tool_result`
  message whose normalized text appears in several distinct sessions (a standing instruction
  the harness prepends to every session). The `annotate` pass computes it; `ingest` runs it
  automatically at the end. The `transcript-query` skill's `search.py --exclude-injected` drops
  these so a term search reflects what sessions actually did, not the instruction text that
  appears everywhere.
- `tool_calls` — per message: `call_id`, `name`, `arguments`, the result message, `is_error`.
- `messages_fts` — an FTS5 external-content index over `messages.text`, kept in sync by
  triggers.

`text` holds text blocks only (no tool arguments, no thinking). Re-parsing a file deletes
its sessions first, so rows never duplicate. A file that is no longer in the raw set loses
its rows on the next `ingest`; that includes a dsh `session.jsonl.zstd` once a
`session.v3.jsonl.zstd` sits beside it, since dsh's v3 upgrade rewrites the whole history
into the v3 file.

## Privacy invariants

- **Transcripts and anything derived from them never enter a git repo** — the database is as
  sensitive as the raw files. The worktree guard refuses a cache root inside a git worktree.
- Raw files are read, never rewritten; the exports stay the source of truth.
- Fixtures in this repo are synthetic; real transcript text is never copied into it.
