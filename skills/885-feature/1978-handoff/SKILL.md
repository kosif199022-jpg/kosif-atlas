name: handoff
description: >
  Write a mid-phase handoff when a session must stop before its phase's output exists —
  quota exhausted, end of day, the context safety rail in the user's CLAUDE.md, or the
  55-minute idle wake-up firing.
  Use for "/feature:handoff", "write a handoff", or when the idle wake-up prompt says to. NOT at a
  phase end: a phase's output (plan.md, the PR, verdict JSONs) is its
  own record and needs no handoff.

# Handoff — what a resumer needs, and nothing else

A resumer reads the handoff plus the phase's document (or, for research, the materialized
findings). Everything else must be pointed to, not restated. Target under 40 lines for the
handoff itself. File: `handoff.md` beside the phase document (`plan.md`), rewritten in place on every later
handoff for the same topic.

## Five sections, in this order

1. **Stopped at** — one sentence: the phase, the step within it, why the stop.
2. **Done** — pointers only: commit SHAs, file paths, artifact URLs, data files, memory
   files. No narration of what they contain.
3. **Next** — the single next step and the command or prompt that starts it.
4. **Unverified** — every assumption still standing, one line each, with what would settle
   it. Write "none" rather than omitting the heading.
5. **Do not redo** — what looks unfinished but is finished, with the evidence; sources
   already exhausted; queries and quotas already spent.

## Rules

- Every claim carries a SHA, path, URL or command. A sentence without one is narration; cut it.
- Do not summarise the plan or the report. Link them.
- Do not record decisions already in a phase document or a memory file. Link them.
- One next step, not a list. The resumer decides the rest from the phase document.

## Two shapes

**Development flow** (plan → ship): "Done" is SHAs and
phase docs; "Next" is the phase after the one that produced the last document: writing `plan.md`,
or the ship step on `plan.md`; "Do not redo" is the probes already
green and the workstreams already merged (with the check output path).

**Research session** (gather → analyse → derive → report): there is no phase doc, and mid-session
the substance lives only in tool results and assistant messages. So a research handoff has a
**materialize step first**, then the five sections. Materialize into `specs/<date>-<topic>/`:
- `findings.md` — every insight derived so far, one bullet each, with its evidence (a number,
  a quote, a file path, a URL). This is the file the resumer actually reads.
- raw data that exists only in the transcript (fetched pages, API responses, agent reports)
  saved as files; scripts already on disk are pointers, not copies.
- `sources.md` — the queries run, the sources exhausted, the retrieval quotas spent (X, Reddit,
  opencli budgets), so nothing is re-fetched.
Then "Done" lists those paths; "Unverified" is the claims not yet cross-checked; "Do not redo"
points at `sources.md`. The 40-line cap applies to the handoff, not to the materialized files.
Record the session id in "Stopped at": the transcript under `~/.claude/projects/` holds every
tool result, and a resumer can pull one specific result from it by grep without reading it all.

## Trigger

The idle wake-up: a Stop hook in the dotfiles schedules a one-shot 55 minutes after every turn
end; if the session is still idle it fires "[idle-wakeup <session>] If still idle, write the
handoff per the feature:handoff skill and end." The hook owns scheduling: never create, delete or
reschedule the wake-up yourself. A later handoff for the same topic replaces the earlier file in
place; never date a second file or append.
