# workspace-browser-config

Resolve `PLUGIN_ROOT` from this selected skill's installed source path: it is
the directory two levels above this `SKILL.md`. Never infer it from cwd or
hardcode a marketplace-cache version.

Run:

```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/workspace-browser-config.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

Flags: `--config PATH`, `--provider codex|claude|all`, `--apply`, and
`--json`. Without `--apply` the command is read-only. Apply backs up existing
files and refuses conflicting unmanaged entries; relay that refusal rather
than overwriting the entry.

For schema-v5 `browsers`, select one entry with `--browser SESSION_ID`. Multiple
entries require unique ports and MCP server names; root owns config writes.
