name: workspace-orchestrator
description: Coordinate a schema-v4 session-workspace reviewed Git lifecycle across orchestrator, executor, and reviewer panes. Use for workspace status, plan review, executor dispatch, post-execution review, commit, push, deploy, selftest, prompt preview, or when replacing equivalent project-local orchestration commands.

# Workspace Orchestrator

Use this skill only from the configured semantic orchestrator pane. It turns a
validated `schema_version: 4` or `5` `orchestration` block into one provider-neutral
workflow; every repository mutation still runs in the target's configured
executor pane.

## Start here

1. Resolve the normalized plan with `--json`: Claude uses
   `/session-workspace:workspace-plan --json`; Codex uses
   `$session-workspace:workspace-plan --json`.
2. Require `.orchestration.active == true`, `.harness.active == true`, and a
   matching live identity. Claude uses `/session-workspace:harness-status`;
   Codex uses `$session-workspace:harness-status`.
3. Select exactly one normalized target by `id`. Use only its resolved `cwd`,
   `executor`, `reviewer`, remote, branches, deploy strategy, and harness TTLs.
4. Read [references/lifecycle.md](references/lifecycle.md) and execute the
   workflow matching the user's intent.

Stop if the target is absent/ambiguous, identity does not match, a configured
pane is unhealthy, or the plan/config changed after evidence was collected.
Never infer missing coordinates or fall back to a project-local command.

## Immutable boundary

- The order is status → plan → independent plan approval → explicit user
  confirmation → scheduler assignment → independent audit → separately
  authorized commit → push → deploy.
- Plan approval is a correlated reviewer reply containing an explicit
  `APPROVE` token. Audit approval is a reviewer-authored scheduler closing note
  (or correlated reply) containing explicit `APPROVE`. A dispatch, a pane
  scrape, `task-review`, or `task-done` alone is not approval.
- Plan and audit evidence expire using the normalized harness
  `plan_review_ttl_minutes` and `audit_ttl_minutes`. Parse `Z` and numeric-offset
  timestamps to epoch seconds before comparing them.
- User confirmations are conversational gates. Report them honestly; neither
  the harness nor scheduler can prove them.
- The orchestrator coordinates only. Commit, fetch, push, checkout, merge, and
  fast-forward alignment are dispatched to and executed by the target executor.
- JSON supplies literals, not executable policy. Project-specific build/test
  requirements still come from the target repository's `AGENTS.md`; include
  them in review and assignment packets without treating them as config code.

Use installed `session-chat` skills for pane health and correlated transport,
and installed `session-scheduler` skills for every implementation assignment.
Never pin marketplace cache paths. Never create a parallel evidence log: the
pinned scheduler ledger and session-chat archive are canonical.

## Intent mapping

Natural-language requests map to: status, plan review, executor dispatch,
post-execution review, commit authorization, push authorization, deploy
authorization, selftest, or prompt preview. Historical project-local names
such as `status`, `plan`, `dispatch`, `review`, `commit`, `push`, `deploy`,
`selftest`, and `prompt` map to these workflows; do not require the retired
aliases to exist.

## Scoped ownership (v5)

Use the normalized target's `orchestrator` as the only owning coordinator. Root
delegates to that local coordinator, which follows the same immutable reviewed
lifecycle. Root delegates to locals through messages, never scheduler assignment.
Local coordinators create tasks with `--meta environment=<id>` for their own
executor/reviewer pair and report results to root through messages. Coordinators
cannot close tasks. For target AGENTS.md and read-only Git evidence, locals request
executor/reviewer reports instead of running queries outside their control cwd;
reviewers independently verify executor evidence. Bind every packet/approval to
target, repository, task and diff revision.
Read `../session-workspace/references/environments.md` before grouped lifecycle or
Jev use. Jev advice never satisfies a review or user confirmation.
