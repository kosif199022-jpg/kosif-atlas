# Akbun Make Anki (Japanese)

The learner is a Korean beginner in week 4 of studying Japanese. They can barely read hiragana and cannot yet read kanji or katakana fluently. Every card must give them a reading aid, spoken audio, and a Korean meaning on the back.

## Purpose

Turn **photos (screenshots) or PDF files containing Japanese words or sentences** into an Anki deck. The source is whatever the user attaches — a vocab list snapshot, a page of example sentences, a handwritten note photo, a PDF export, etc. This skill is *not* limited to formal textbooks; any image or PDF with Japanese text is valid input.

## What this skill does

1. Read Japanese text from every attached image and/or every page of the PDF.
2. Extract each learnable unit (one card per word or per sentence).
3. Build an Anki deck where:
   - **Front** = the original Japanese exactly as printed (kanji + kana intact) **plus Anki TTS audio** of that Japanese so the learner hears it the moment the card flips up.
   - **Back** = hiragana reading (furigana for the whole line) + Korean 발음 approximation + Korean meaning + optional short tip.
4. Package the deck as `.apkg` and save it to `~/Downloads/anki-jp-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.apkg`.
5. Tell the user how to import it into Anki for macOS and sync to AnkiWeb.

## Step 1 — Read the source material

The user may attach **multiple screenshot images**, **a PDF file**, or a mix of both. Handle all of it in one pass.

**If the input is images:** Use the Read tool on each image path the user provided. Read every single one — do not skip any.

**If the input is a PDF:** Use the Read tool with the `pages` parameter to read the PDF. PDFs over 10 pages must be read in chunks of at most 20 pages per call (e.g. `pages: "1-20"`, then `"21-40"`, etc.). For each chunk, extract items before moving to the next chunk so nothing is lost between calls. If the PDF is short (≤10 pages), read it in one call without the `pages` parameter.

**If the input mixes images and PDFs:** Process the PDF first (it is usually the bulk of the material), then the loose screenshots, then merge everything into a single cards list in the order the user gave them.

For every page/image:

- Transcribe the Japanese text as it appears, preserving kanji and katakana.
- If furigana is already printed above a kanji, record that reading — don't re-guess it.
- If a page shows a vocabulary list with Korean/English glosses, capture those glosses; they're more reliable than your own translation.
- If a page shows example sentences, capture each sentence as its own item.

Silently fix obvious OCR-style ambiguities (e.g., `ロ` vs `口`, `一` vs `ー`) using context. If something is genuinely unreadable (glare, cropped), skip it and note the count of skipped items at the end.

**Granularity rule** — one card per learnable unit:

- Vocabulary images → one card per vocabulary entry.
- Sentence images → one card per full sentence (not per word inside the sentence).
- If a page mixes both, produce both kinds of cards.

## Step 2 — Build each card

For every extracted item, prepare three fields:

| Field | Content |
|---:|:---|
| `japanese` | Original Japanese, kanji + kana as printed. This is what Anki TTS will speak on the front of the card. |
| `reading` | The entire line rewritten in hiragana only, followed by ` · ` and the Korean approximation pronunciation (한국어 발음). Example: `たかい · 타카이`, `がっこうはちかいですか · 각코-와 치카이데스카`. Use `-` for long vowels (장음: `おお`, `おう`, `えい` → `오-`, `에-`), keep particle `は` as `와`, `へ` as `에`, `を` as `오`, and drop the devoiced vowel of `です` (`데스`). |
| `meaning` | Korean meaning. Short and natural, not word-for-word. For sentences, give a clean Korean sentence. For single words, give the Korean word plus a part-of-speech hint only when it helps (e.g., `먹다 (동사)`). |
| `kanji` | **Required whenever the Japanese contains one or more kanji.** One entry per kanji appearing in the `japanese` field, joined with ` · `. Each entry is `{한자}: {한국어 훈음}` — e.g. for `学校は高いですか`, set `kanji` to `学: 배울 학 · 校: 학교 교 · 高: 높을 고`. Use traditional 훈음 (뜻+음) the learner would see in a Korean 한자 dictionary. Preserve the order the kanji appear in the sentence and do not deduplicate — if the same kanji appears twice, list it twice. Omit this field entirely only when the Japanese line has zero kanji (pure kana). |

Optionally, append a one-line `tip` (prefixed with `💡`) when there's a genuine pronunciation trap (촉음, 장음, `は`→wa, devoiced `です`, etc.). Do not invent tips for every card.

## Step 3 — Generate the .apkg

Use the bundled script `scripts/build_deck.py`. It takes a JSON file of cards and writes the `.apkg` to `~/anki-jp-{timestamp}.apkg`. The card template has Anki TTS wired into the front, so no extra audio files need to be generated — Anki speaks the `Japanese` field on the user's device using the system Japanese voice.

Workflow:

1. Write the extracted cards to a temp JSON file, e.g. `/tmp/japan_cards.json`, as an array of `{japanese, reading, meaning}` objects. Include `kanji` whenever the Japanese contains any kanji, and include `tip` only when present.
2. Run the build script:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_deck.py /tmp/japan_cards.json
```

3. The script prints the output path. Confirm it to the user.

The script uses [`genanki`](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) and bootstraps its own virtualenv at `~/.cache/akbun-make-anki-japanese/venv` on first run, so the user does not need to install anything globally. Do not silently fall back to a `.txt` file — the user asked for a proper Anki package.

The deck name is `Akbun Japanese — {YYYY-MM-DD}`. The front shows the Japanese in a large serif font and plays Anki TTS automatically; the back shows reading (hiragana · 한국어 발음) on one line, Korean meaning on the next line, and — when the front contains kanji — a 한자 훈음 line directly below the Korean meaning. The tip (if any) is shown in a smaller muted style.

### Anki TTS requirement

Anki's built-in TTS needs a Japanese voice installed on the playback device:

- **macOS / iOS**: System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content → System Voice → add a Japanese voice (e.g., Kyoko, Otoya).
- **Android (AnkiDroid)**: Install Google 텍스트 음성 변환 and add a Japanese language pack.
- **AnkiWeb (browser)**: Uses the browser's speech synthesis; modern Chrome/Safari already include a Japanese voice.

Mention this requirement to the user once, after generating the deck, so they know why audio might be silent on a fresh device.

## Step 4 — Tell the user how to import and sync

After the file is written, print these instructions verbatim in Korean (adjust the filename to match what was actually generated):

```

## Study Guide Mode

When the user asks for a study guide, learning plan, or "공부해야 할 주제/목표/공부방법" based on the material they attached, generate a standalone markdown file and save it to `~/Downloads/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md` in addition to (or instead of) the Anki deck, depending on what the user asked for. This mode produces a Notion-uploadable study plan.

### Study Guide Output Rules

- Save the file to `~/Downloads/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md` using the current timestamp. Tell the user the full path after writing.
- The file is meant for Notion upload, so:
  - Do NOT use markdown tables. Notion's markdown importer mangles them.
  - Use nested bullet lists (list depth) for every structured piece of information — vocabulary groups, activation patterns, schedules, etc.
  - Headings: one `#` for the title, `##` for top-level sections. Do not skip heading levels.
- Always include every Japanese term with both hiragana reading and Korean approximation in parentheses. Example: `高い(たかい, 비싸다)`, `学校(がっこう, 학교)`.
  - Use `-` for long vowels (장음: `おお`, `おう`, `えい` → `오-`, `에-`).
  - Apply particle exceptions (`は`→와, `へ`→에, `を`→오) inside sentence examples.
- Required sections, in this order:
    1. `## 공부해야 할 주제` — what to study from the attached material. Break into sub-bullets: vocabulary (grouped by meaning pairs when possible), grammar patterns, exceptions, pronunciation points.
    2. `## 목표` — measurable goals. Break into 단기(this week) / 중기(2 weeks) / 장기(1 month) sub-bullets.
    3. `## 공부 방법` — concrete daily routine. Break into numbered 단계(steps) with time budget per step, plus a 주간 점검(weekly review) bullet.
    4. `## 피해야 할 함정` — common traps and anti-patterns specific to this material (e.g., `いい → よくありません` irregular).
- Keep bullets action-oriented and specific to the material the user provided. Do not write generic advice.
- Do not invent vocabulary or grammar that was not in the user's input — stay faithful to what the user attached.
- If the user already received an Anki deck in the same turn, reference the deck filename in the 공부 방법 section so the routine ties back to the cards.

## Guardrails

- Never produce cards whose reading is identical to the front. If the front is already all hiragana, repeat it in the `reading` field anyway — blank fields break the template.
- Never leave `meaning` empty. If you truly cannot determine a meaning, skip that card rather than ship a blank one.
- Do not merge multiple vocabulary items into one card to "save space." Each card must test exactly one thing.
- Never output the Japanese in romaji on the back. The learner is building hiragana fluency; romaji is a crutch. Korean 발음 (한글 approximation) is allowed and required — it is NOT romaji.
- Do not reorder or re-interpret the source. The user's image/PDF is the source of truth; your job is faithful extraction, not curation.
