## What It Does

A fast path for the most common solo-dev operation: auditing your latest
fix and folding it into the current branch commit via `gt commit amend`,
then re-submitting.

## When to Use

- User says "amend this", "add this to the current PR", "fold this fix
  in", or has follow-up edits for an already-submitted branch.
- Not for starting new work — use the `smart-submit` skill instead.

## Usage

Optional arguments:

- `--no-verify` — Skip the audit and amend directly (use with caution)
- `--no-submit` — Amend the commit locally but do not push to GitHub
- `--publish` — Override draft mode: submit as published even if
  `submit.draft: true` in `.graphite.yml`

The argument text provided after the skill name (if any) is available as
context for this invocation.

### Phase 0: Read Convention File

Check for a `.graphite.yml` convention file and parse audit settings. Run:

```bash
REPO_TOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo ".")
GW_AUDIT_AGENTS=""
GW_SKIP_ON_DRAFT=""
GW_DRAFT=""

if command -v yq >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
   yq --help 2>&1 | grep -qi 'jq wrapper\|kislyuk' && \
   [ -f "$REPO_TOP/.graphite.yml" ]; then
  yq_err=""
  GW_AUDIT_AGENTS=$(yq -r '.audit.agents // ""' "$REPO_TOP/.graphite.yml" 2>/dev/null) || yq_err="audit.agents"
  GW_SKIP_ON_DRAFT=$(yq -r '.audit.skip_on_draft // ""' "$REPO_TOP/.graphite.yml" 2>/dev/null) || yq_err="${yq_err:+$yq_err, }skip_on_draft"
  GW_DRAFT=$(yq -r '.submit.draft // ""' "$REPO_TOP/.graphite.yml" 2>/dev/null) || yq_err="${yq_err:+$yq_err, }submit.draft"
  if [ -n "$yq_err" ]; then
    printf '[gt-workflow] Warning: yq failed to parse fields: %s. Using defaults for those.\n' "$yq_err" >&2
  else
    printf '[gt-workflow] Convention file loaded: %s/.graphite.yml\n' "$REPO_TOP" >&2
  fi
elif [ -f "$REPO_TOP/.graphite.yml" ]; then
  printf '[gt-workflow] Warning: .graphite.yml exists but yq (kislyuk) is not installed. Using defaults.\n' >&2
  printf '[gt-workflow] Install yq: pip install yq\n' >&2
fi

# Validate and clamp audit.agents to 1-3 range
if [ -n "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" ]; then
  case "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" in
    *[!0-9]*) printf '[gt-workflow] Warning: audit.agents value "%s" is not an integer. Using default 3.\n' "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" >&2; GW_AUDIT_AGENTS=3 ;;
  esac
  if [ "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" -lt 1 ] 2>/dev/null; then
    printf '[gt-workflow] Warning: audit.agents=%s is below minimum. Using 1.\n' "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" >&2
    GW_AUDIT_AGENTS=1
  elif [ "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" -gt 3 ] 2>/dev/null; then
    printf '[gt-workflow] Warning: audit.agents=%s exceeds maximum. Using 3.\n' "$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS" >&2
    GW_AUDIT_AGENTS=3
  fi
fi
```

Store these values for use in Phase 2. Default: 3 agents, skip_on_draft=false.

### Phase 1: Understand Current State

Run these commands to confirm there are changes to amend and that we are on a
feature branch:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git branch --show-current
gt trunk
gt log short
```

**Guard checks:**

- If there are **no uncommitted changes**, tell the user and exit — there is
  nothing to amend.
- If the current branch **equals trunk**, warn the user: amending trunk is
  dangerous. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before proceeding.
  (`AskUserQuestion` and the `Skill` tool are Claude Code primitives — on
  Codex, ask confirmation questions as numbered options in your reply and
  wait for the answer, and follow the Codex-exposed `audit-review` skill
  directly instead of invoking a Skill tool; this applies throughout this
  skill.)

### Phase 2: Audit (skip if `--no-verify`)

**Skip-on-draft check:** If `$GW_SKIP_ON_DRAFT` is `true` and `$GW_DRAFT` is
`true` (from `.graphite.yml`), skip the entire audit phase and proceed to
Phase 3. This matches the same logic used in the `smart-submit` skill.

> **Note:** `$GW_DRAFT` reflects the `submit.draft` flag in `.graphite.yml` (the
> repo-level config intent for _new_ submits), **not** the live PR draft state.
> A PR that has already been promoted out of draft will still trigger the skip
> if `submit.draft: true` is set in the config. This is intentional — performing
> a `gh pr view --json isDraft` lookup on every amend would add a network
> roundtrip. If you need audit enforcement, do not use `--no-verify` because it
> bypasses checks entirely. Instead, keep `audit.skip_on_draft: false` or set
> `submit.draft: false` in repo config so the amend path never skips audit
> because of draft-mode config.

#### 0. Capture the Diff Once

```bash
git diff
```

Store this output as `$DIFF_OUTPUT` and pass it to each audit agent below.

#### 1. Run the Audit

Invoke the `Skill` tool with `skill: "audit-review"` (on Codex, per the
Phase 1 guard-check note, follow the Codex-exposed `audit-review` skill
directly instead — do not invoke a `Skill` tool), passing `$DIFF_OUTPUT`
and `$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS` as context. It runs the appropriate quick-code-review
/ quick-security-scan / quick-error-check prompts (1-3 of them, per
`$GW_AUDIT_AGENTS`) and returns a CRITICAL / MINOR / CLEAN verdict with
file:line findings.

> **Note:** `audit-review`'s prompt bodies are the fuller versions
> originally written for `smart-submit` (numbered checklists per prompt)
> rather than this skill's previous shorter one-liners — consolidating the
> two callers onto one skill meant picking a single canonical wording, and
> the richer version was kept. The audit is stricter as a result; this is
> an intentional side effect of Step 10 of the Codex-pilot plan, not a
> behavior change to fix.

#### 2. Gate Check

If `audit-review` reports a dispatch failure (an audit failed to run or
timed out), inform the user which audit is missing and ask whether to
proceed with partial results or abort.

**IF CRITICAL ISSUES**: Show them and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

- "Fix issues first (Recommended)"
- "Amend anyway"
- "Abort"

**IF MINOR ISSUES**: Show warnings and proceed.

**IF CLEAN**: Proceed automatically.

### Phase 3: Stage & Amend

#### 1. Stage Specific Files

Do **not** use `git add .`. Stage only the changed files by name:

```bash
git diff --name-only
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

Exclude `.env*` files, credential files, binaries, and build artifacts. Then:

```bash
git add -- "<file1>" "<file2>"
```

#### 2. Amend via Graphite

By default, keep the existing commit message (amend silently):

```bash
gt commit amend --no-edit
```

If the user wants to update the commit message too, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
"Update the commit message? (leave blank to keep current)". If they provide one:

```bash
gt commit amend -m "<new message>"
```

### Phase 4: Re-submit

Skip this phase if `--no-submit` was passed — report the amended state and exit.

Build the submit command with convention file flags:

```bash
gt submit --no-interactive
```

Append flags to the submit command (only if set and non-empty):

- If `$GW_DRAFT` is `true` (and no explicit `--publish` argument): add `--draft`

After submitting:

```bash
gt log short
gt pr
```

Output a summary:

- Branch amended
- PR link (updated)
- Stack visualization
- Any audit warnings

### Success Criteria

- Uncommitted changes audited (unless `--no-verify`)
- Files staged individually (no blanket `git add .`)
- Current branch commit amended via `gt commit amend`
- Stack re-submitted to GitHub (unless `--no-submit`)
- User provided with updated PR link
