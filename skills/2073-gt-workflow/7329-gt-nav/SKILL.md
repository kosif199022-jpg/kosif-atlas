## What It Does

Visualizes your current Graphite stack and lets you navigate between
branches — jump to the top or bottom, move up/down, or check out a
specific branch by name. Optionally shows PR status for each branch in
the stack.

## When to Use

- User says "show my stack", "where am I in the stack", "go up/down a
  branch", or "checkout the top of the stack".
- Not for restacking, syncing, or cleanup — use the `gt-sync` or
  `gt-cleanup` skills instead.

## Usage

Optional arguments:

- `--pr` — Also show PR status for each branch
- `--top` — Jump directly to the top of the stack
- `--bottom` — Jump directly to the bottom of the stack

The argument text provided after the skill name (if any) is available as
context for this invocation.

### Phase 1: Visualize Stack

#### 1. Show Full Stack

```bash
gt log
```

#### 2. Show Current Position

```bash
echo "Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
```

#### 3. Show PR Status (if `--pr` is provided)

```bash
gt pr
```

#### 4. Handle Direct Navigation Arguments

If `--top` was passed:

```bash
gt top
echo "Jumped to top: $(git branch --show-current)"
gt log short
```

Then show the stack and exit.

If `--bottom` was passed:

```bash
gt bottom
gt log short
```

Then show the stack and exit.

### Phase 2: Interactive Navigation

If no direct navigation argument was given, present options using
AskUserQuestion. (`AskUserQuestion` is a Claude Code tool — on Codex, present
the same options as a numbered list in your reply and wait for the user's
answer; this applies to every AskUserQuestion mention in this skill.)

Ask: "Where do you want to go?"

Options:

- **Go up** — Move to the child branch (`gt up`)
- **Go down** — Move to the parent branch (`gt down`)
- **Jump to top** — Move to the top of the stack (`gt top`)
- **Jump to bottom** — Move to the bottom of the stack (`gt bottom`)

The user can also type a specific branch name via the "Other" option.

#### Execute Navigation

Based on the user's choice:

**Go up:**

```bash
gt up
```

**Go down:**

```bash
gt down
```

**Jump to top:**

```bash
gt top
```

**Jump to bottom:**

```bash
gt bottom
```

**Specific branch (from "Other" input):**

```bash
gt checkout -- "<branch-name>"
```

#### Show New Position

After navigating:

```bash
echo "Now on: $(git branch --show-current)"
gt log short
```

### Success Criteria

- Stack is clearly visualized with current position highlighted
- PR status shown for context
- User can navigate up/down/top/bottom or to a specific branch
- New position confirmed after navigation
