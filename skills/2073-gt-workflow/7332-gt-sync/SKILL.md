## What It Does

One-command repo sync: pulls the latest from trunk, restacks your
branches, and cleans up merged PRs.

## When to Use

- User says "sync with main", "rebase my stack", or "pull latest".
- After PRs merge, or when `gt` reports "needs restack".
- Not for deleting stale local-only branches — use the `gt-cleanup` skill
  instead.

## Usage

Optional arguments:

- `--no-delete` — Skip deleting merged branches by passing `--no-interactive`
  through to `gt sync` so it does not prompt for (or perform) deletions (`gt
  sync` has no `--no-delete` flag itself)
- `--force` — Restack even if the stack appears clean (still stopping at
  conflicts for manual resolution) instead of skipping the restack step
  (Phase 2 Step 3) when there are no divergence markers; `gt sync` itself
  (Phase 2 Step 1) always runs regardless

The argument text provided after the skill name (if any) is available as
context for this invocation.

### Phase 1: Pre-Sync State

#### 1. Capture Current State

Record the starting point so we can report what changed:

```bash
echo "=== Current branch ==="
git branch --show-current

echo "=== Trunk branch ==="
gt trunk

gt log short

echo "=== Local branches ==="
git branch --list
```

### Phase 2: Sync

#### 1. Sync with Trunk

Run Graphite repo sync to pull the latest trunk and identify merged branches.

If `--no-delete` was passed:

```bash
gt sync --no-interactive
```

Otherwise:

```bash
gt sync
```

If `gt sync` fails (network error, authentication issue, etc.), report the
error to the user and stop. Do not proceed to restacking with stale state.

This will:

- Fetch and fast-forward trunk
- Detect merged branches and prompt for deletion (when `--no-delete` is not
  passed)

#### 2. Check Post-Sync Stack State

```bash
gt log short
```

Inspect the output for divergence markers. Graphite indicates a branch needs
restacking when it shows `(needs restack)` next to a branch name, or when a
branch is shown with `◯` instead of `◉` (indicating it is no longer based on its
parent's current tip). If none of these markers appear and `--force` was not
passed, skip to Phase 3; otherwise continue to the restacking step in Phase 2.

#### 3. Restack if Needed

If branches need restacking (they've diverged from their parents after trunk
moved):

```bash
gt stack restack
```

If the restack fails, check whether it's due to conflicts or another error:

**If conflicts:**

1. Report which branch has conflicts
2. Report which files are conflicted
3. Tell the user to resolve conflicts manually, then run:
   ```
   git add <resolved-files>
   gt continue
   ```
4. Or to abort the restack entirely:
   ```
   git rebase --abort
   ```
5. Stop execution — don't try to auto-resolve conflicts

**If non-conflict failure** (network, auth, corrupted state):

1. Report the error output from `gt stack restack`
2. Suggest running `git status` and `gt log short` to diagnose
3. Stop execution

### Phase 3: Report

#### 1. Final State

```bash
echo "=== Final stack ==="
gt log short

echo "=== Branches ==="
git branch --list
```

#### 2. Summary

Output a report:

```
Sync Complete
─────────────
Trunk:       <trunk branch> (updated to <short sha>)
Restacked:   <yes/no/not needed>
Conflicts:   <none / list of conflicted branches>
Cleaned up:  <list of deleted merged branches, or "none">
Current:     <current branch>

Stack:
<gt log short output>
```

### Success Criteria

- Trunk is up to date with remote
- Merged branches are cleaned up (unless `--no-delete`)
- Stack is restacked on latest trunk
- Any conflicts are clearly reported with resolution instructions
- User sees a clear before/after summary
