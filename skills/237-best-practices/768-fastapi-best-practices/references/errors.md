# FAPI error-handling rules

Detailed entries for `FAPI-050..FAPI-053`. Each follows the four-part
**What / Why / How / When NOT to apply** shape.

## FAPI-050 — Register handlers against `StarletteHTTPException` to also catch routing 404/405

**What.** `fastapi.HTTPException` subclasses
`starlette.exceptions.HTTPException`. Starlette's router itself raises the
*base* class for "route not found" (404) and "method not allowed" (405).
Register your custom HTTP-error handler against
`from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException`.

**Why.** A handler bound to `fastapi.HTTPException` catches only what your
code raises explicitly. Requests to a nonexistent path bypass it and get
Starlette's raw default 404, so your API returns two different error
envelopes depending on whether the failure was application-level or
routing-level — and clients can't rely on a consistent shape.

**How.**

```python
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException
from fastapi.exception_handlers import http_exception_handler

@app.exception_handler(StarletteHTTPException)
async def on_http_exception(request, exc):
    # reuse FastAPI's default formatting, or build your own envelope
    return await http_exception_handler(request, exc)
```

**When NOT to apply.** If you're satisfied with FastAPI's default error
bodies, you don't need a custom handler at all — the rule only matters
once you standardize on a custom envelope and need it applied uniformly.

---

## FAPI-051 — Override `RequestValidationError` to stabilize the 422 response shape

**What.** Install `@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)` when
consumers depend on a stable error envelope. FastAPI's default 422 body
(`{"detail": [...pydantic error objects...]}`) exposes Pydantic's internal
error structure.

**Why.** Pydantic's error format is an implementation detail that changed
between v1 and v2. A client that parsed the default 422 will break on a
Pydantic upgrade unless you own and stabilize the shape yourself. A custom
handler decouples your public error contract from your Pydantic version.

**How.**

```python
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

@app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def on_validation_error(request, exc: RequestValidationError):
    errors = [{"field": ".".join(map(str, e["loc"])), "message": e["msg"]}
              for e in exc.errors()]
    return JSONResponse(status_code=422, content={"errors": errors})
```

**When NOT to apply.** Internal APIs where you control both ends and pin
Pydantic — the default 422 is informative and not worth replacing.

---

## FAPI-052 — Register a catch-all `Exception` handler for a uniform `500` body; don't log in it

**What.** Install `@app.exception_handler(Exception)` that returns a
`500` in the same body shape as your other error handlers (FAPI-050,
FAPI-051, FAPI-053). Don't log the exception in it, and read the request
correlation ID from `request.state`, not from a ContextVar.

**Why.** Starlette routes this handler to its outermost
`ServerErrorMiddleware`, which shapes what the handler can and can't do
(`starlette/middleware/errors.py`):

- **The exception is already logged.** After sending the handler's
  response, the middleware re-raises: "We always continue to raise the
  exception. This allows servers to log the error". Uvicorn then logs the
  traceback, so a `logger.exception` in the handler logs every error
  twice.
- **It buys a uniform body, not safety.** Without a handler, the
  non-debug default is already a bare `PlainTextResponse("Internal Server
  Error", status_code=500)` with no traceback. The handler's value is
  a body clients can parse like every other error.
- **`debug=True` bypasses it.** With debug on, the middleware renders the
  traceback response before it ever consults the handler, so the handler
  does not protect against a debug flag that ships to production. Keep
  `debug` off in production config.
- **It runs outside all user middleware.** By the time it runs, a
  request-ID middleware has already reset its ContextVar, and the
  handler's response goes straight to the server, bypassing that
  middleware's `send` wrapper (so no `X-Request-ID` header either). Have
  the middleware also store the ID on `scope["state"]`; the handler reads
  it back as `request.state.request_id`.

**How.**

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def on_unhandled(request: Request, exc: Exception) -> JSONResponse:
    # No logging here: ServerErrorMiddleware re-raises and the server logs it.
    request_id = getattr(request.state, "request_id", None)
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={"detail": "Internal server error", "request_id": request_id},
        headers={"X-Request-ID": request_id} if request_id else None,
    )
```

In the request-ID middleware, next to setting the ContextVar:

```python
scope.setdefault("state", {})["request_id"] = request_id
```

Register it alongside the `StarletteHTTPException` and
`RequestValidationError` handlers — FastAPI dispatches by exception type,
so the specific handlers still win for their types.

**When NOT to apply.** Never skip it in production if clients parse
error bodies. The one caveat: don't let the catch-all swallow
`HTTPException`/validation errors — those have their own handlers and
should keep their intended status codes, not collapse to 500.

## FAPI-053 — Use a structured `detail` (dict with a code) for machine-readable errors

**What.** `HTTPException(detail=...)` accepts any JSON-serializable value.
For APIs consumed by code (not just humans), prefer
`detail={"code": "ITEM_NOT_FOUND", "item_id": item_id}` over a bare
string.

**Why.** A string detail forces clients to pattern-match natural-language
messages to identify an error type — brittle, and it breaks the moment
you reword the message or localize it. A stable `code` lets clients branch
deterministically and lets you change human-facing text freely.

**How.**

```python
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=404,
    detail={"code": "ITEM_NOT_FOUND", "item_id": item_id},
)
```

Define an error-code enum once if the API has many error types, so codes
stay consistent.

**When NOT to apply.** Small internal or human-facing endpoints where no
programmatic client branches on error type — a clear string is simpler
and fine.
