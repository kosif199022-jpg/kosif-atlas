# Buildx & cache backend rules

Detailed explanation for each `BUILDX-NNN` rule. These cover the
build-execution side of BuildKit: cache backends, builder drivers,
multi-target builds with bake, and the `--load` / `--push` / `--output`
distinction that trips up most newcomers.

These rules pair with the BuildKit-side rules in `dockerfile.md`
(DOCKER-009 cache mounts, DOCKER-010 secret mounts, DOCKER-017
multi-arch cache scoping) and the security/build rules in
`security-build.md` (SEC-002 BuildKit-by-default, SEC-004
multi-platform, SEC-006 secret mounts).

## BUILDX-001 — Pick a cache backend per scenario

**What.** BuildKit supports several `--cache-from` / `--cache-to`
backend types. The right choice depends on where the build runs:

| Backend | Best for | Driver requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `type=inline` | Image-exporter builds where you push to a registry anyway | Any; `docker` driver only with the containerd image store |
| `type=registry` | Cross-CI portability; biggest fit when you push to a registry | Any; `docker` driver only with the containerd image store |
| `type=gha` | GitHub Actions specifically — built-in cache backend with action support | Any; `docker` driver only with the containerd image store |
| `type=local` | Single-machine builds with a persistent cache dir | Any; `docker` driver only with the containerd image store |
| `type=s3` | AWS-native CI (still flagged unreleased; preview only) | `docker-container` / `kubernetes` |
| `type=azblob` | Azure-native CI (also still preview) | `docker-container` / `kubernetes` |

**Why.** External caches are "almost essential" in ephemeral CI runners
(per the [official docs](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/))
because nothing persists between runs. Picking the right backend for
your CI platform makes the difference between 30-second cache hits and
5-minute cold builds.

The **default `docker` driver** "supports the `inline`, `local`,
`registry`, and `gha` cache backends, but only if you have enabled the
containerd image store" (the default image store on Docker Engine 29+ and
Docker Desktop). With the classic image store, or for the other backends,
switch builder drivers (BUILDX-005).

Cite: [Cache storage backends](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/).

**How.** Decision tree:

- **Building on GitHub Actions?** Use `type=gha`. Cache lives in GHA's own cache store; no extra registry plumbing.
- **Building on any other CI, pushing to a registry?** Use `type=registry`. Tag the cache image at `myrepo/myimage:buildcache` (or per-branch).
- **Inline-only is acceptable?** Use `type=inline`. Simplest, embeds cache metadata in the pushed image — but mode is fixed at `min` and it doesn't separate cache from artifact.
- **Local dev, want a persistent cache dir between builds?** Use `type=local,dest=./buildcache` and `type=local,src=./buildcache`.

**When NOT to apply.** Single ephemeral build with no future runs — no
cache backend needed. Air-gapped environments where registry/cloud
backends are unreachable — fall back to `type=local`.

---

## BUILDX-002 — Set up `--cache-from` and `--cache-to` correctly

**What.** Cache reuse requires both flags. `--cache-from` reads cache;
`--cache-to` writes cache. Neither is automatic. They use the same
syntax shape:

```
--cache-from type=<backend>,ref=<location>[,parameters...]
--cache-to   type=<backend>,ref=<location>[,parameters...]
```

You can specify `--cache-from` multiple times to read from several
sources (e.g. the current branch's cache + a fallback to `main`).

**Why.** People often add `--cache-to` and assume cache reuse "just
works" — but the cache only exists *after* the first build with
`--cache-to`. The next build needs `--cache-from` pointing at the same
location to consume it. Forgetting `--cache-from` means the cache is
written but never read.

The `mode=` parameter controls how much is cached:

- `mode=min` (default) — only the layers exported into the final image. Smaller cache, faster export, but lower hit rate when builds rebuild intermediate stages.
- `mode=max` — all layers, including intermediate stages discarded by multi-stage builds. Bigger cache, higher hit rate, especially for multi-stage builds with lots of `RUN` steps. Worth the extra storage.

**How.** GitHub Actions, `type=gha`:

```yaml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@c3c9e263c25d99ce0380d002d59b67737d91b0dc # v7.4.0
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

GitLab CI / any registry-pushing CI, `type=registry`:

```bash
docker buildx build --push \
  --tag ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:${CI_COMMIT_SHA} \
  --cache-from type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:buildcache-${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG} \
  --cache-from type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:buildcache-main \
  --cache-to   type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:buildcache-${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG},mode=max \
  .
```

Two important details from that example:

1. **Two `--cache-from` sources** — branch cache (most likely hit) with fallback to the `main` cache. First PR on a new branch still benefits from main's cache.
2. **Per-branch cache tag** — each branch writes its own cache (`buildcache-${BRANCH}`). Without this, parallel CI runs on different branches overwrite each other.

ECR / AWS-incompatible registry — add `image-manifest=true`:

```bash
--cache-to type=registry,ref=...,mode=max,oci-mediatypes=true,image-manifest=true
```

[GHA cache backend](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/gha/),
[Registry cache backend](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/registry/).

**When NOT to apply.** When build time is dominated by I/O or external
network (cache won't help). Cold-start CI with no prior runs (cache
empty anyway — first run pays the cost regardless).

---

## BUILDX-003 — Know `--load` vs `--push` vs `--output`

**What.** A `docker buildx build` invocation produces output, and you
have to tell it *where to put the result*. There are three modes,
mutually exclusive:

| Flag | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `--load` | Loads the built image into the local Docker daemon (so `docker images` / `docker run` see it). | Local dev; single-arch unless the daemon uses the containerd image store. |
| `--push` | Pushes the built image directly to a registry without ever touching the local daemon. | CI builds, multi-arch. |
| `--output type=<exporter>,...` | The general form. Includes `--load` and `--push` as shortcuts; also supports `oci`, `tar`, `local`, `image,...`, etc. | When you want OCI archives, tarballs, or non-default exporters. |

**Why.** This is the most common "why isn't my multi-arch image working
locally" failure: `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
--load .` **fails** with "docker exporter does not currently support
exporting manifest lists" when the daemon uses the classic image store,
which holds one architecture per image. The containerd image store
(default on Docker Engine 29+ and Docker Desktop) stores multi-platform
images, and there multi-platform `--load` works.

Cite: [Multi-platform builds — prerequisites](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#prerequisites).

Default behavior with the `docker-container` driver and no output flag:
the build runs but the result is **discarded**. Nothing happens. People
miss this because the build looks successful.

**How.**

```bash
# Local dev, single-arch — load into Docker so you can `docker run` it
docker buildx build --load --tag myimage:dev .

# CI, single or multi-arch — push to registry
docker buildx build --push \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --tag ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:v1 .

# Multi-arch locally — must use --push (registry) or --output type=oci to a tar
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --output type=oci,dest=./multi-arch.tar \
  --tag myimage:multiarch .

# Export to a local image dir
docker buildx build --output type=local,dest=./dist .
```

If you build without specifying `--load`/`--push`/`--output` and the
build succeeds but `docker images` shows nothing — that's the discard
case. You forgot to tell buildx what to do with the result.

**When NOT to apply.** Never — every buildx build needs to specify an
output. If you don't, you wasted compute.

## BUILDX-004 — Use `docker buildx bake` for multi-target / declarative builds

**What.** `bake` lets you define build targets, args, platforms, tags,
and cache config in a file (HCL, JSON, or directly from a
`compose.yaml`) and invoke them by name. Replaces long
`docker buildx build` command lines with reusable, version-controlled
build definitions.

**Why.** Three real wins over raw `docker buildx build`:

1. **No more CLI sprawl.** A typical "build multi-arch with cache and SBOM" command is 6+ flags; bake captures that once.
2. **Multi-target builds.** Build several images in one invocation (`docker buildx bake` builds *all* default targets in parallel). One source of truth for the whole image set.
3. **Compose integration.** Bake reads `compose.yaml` directly — every service with a `build:` section becomes a target. The same compose file describes both runtime and build.

**How.** `docker-bake.hcl` (the canonical name):

```hcl
# Common config for all our images
target "_common" {
  context    = "."
  platforms  = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  cache-from = ["type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/myorg/api:buildcache"]
  cache-to   = ["type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/myorg/api:buildcache,mode=max"]
}

target "api" {
  inherits   = ["_common"]
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  target     = "final"
  tags       = ["ghcr.io/myorg/api:latest"]
}

target "worker" {
  inherits   = ["_common"]
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile.worker"
  tags       = ["ghcr.io/myorg/worker:latest"]
}

# A group lets `bake all` build everything in parallel
group "all" {
  targets = ["api", "worker"]
}

# Default group invoked by bare `docker buildx bake`
group "default" {
  targets = ["api"]
}
```

```bash
docker buildx bake               # builds default group (api)
docker buildx bake all           # builds api + worker in parallel
docker buildx bake api worker    # explicit list
docker buildx bake --push all    # push everything
```

Compose-driven bake (the same compose file as your dev stack):

```bash
docker buildx bake --file compose.yaml --push
```

Cite: [Bake introduction](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/introduction/),
[Bake reference](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/reference/).

**When NOT to apply.** Single-image, single-arch projects with no
cache backend — `docker buildx build .` is simpler. When the team is
unfamiliar with HCL and the CLI hasn't grown to "too many flags" yet.

---

## BUILDX-005 — Pick the right builder driver

**What.** Buildx supports four drivers. The choice determines what
features are available:

| Driver | Default? | Multi-arch | Full cache export | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `docker` | Yes | Only with the containerd image store | With the containerd image store (`inline`/`local`/`registry`/`gha`) | Uses BuildKit baked into the Docker daemon. Simplest; least flexible. Auto-loads images. |
| `docker-container` | No | ✅ | ✅ | Spawns a BuildKit container. The "normal upgrade" — full feature set. |
| `kubernetes` | No | ✅ | ✅ | Spawns BuildKit pods in a K8s cluster. For build farms / large orgs. |
| `remote` | No | ✅ | ✅ | Connects to a pre-managed BuildKit daemon you run elsewhere. |

**Why.** On a daemon with the classic image store, the default `docker`
driver hits walls fast:

- `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push .` → fails ("docker exporter does not currently support exporting manifest lists").
- `--cache-to type=registry,...` → fails: the `docker` driver exports caches only with the containerd image store.
- `--output type=oci` / tarball output → not supported by the `docker` driver on any image store.

The containerd image store (default on Docker Engine 29+ and Docker
Desktop) removes the first two; every one works on `docker-container`.

**How.** Create and use a `docker-container` builder:

```bash
# Create — runs once per machine
docker buildx create --name container --driver docker-container --use

# Optional: bootstrap immediately so first build doesn't pay the cost
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap

# Now multi-arch + full cache backends work
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t myimage .
```

In CI, the `docker/setup-buildx-action` (GitHub Actions) creates a
`docker-container` builder by default — no extra setup needed.

For per-architecture native builders (avoid QEMU emulation cost):

```bash
# Append a remote arm64 native node to a builder
docker buildx create --name multi --driver docker-container --node node-amd64
docker buildx create --append --name multi --node node-arm64 ssh://user@arm-host
docker buildx use multi
```

Cite: [Buildx drivers](https://docs.docker.com/build/builders/drivers/),
[Cache storage backends](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/).

**When NOT to apply.** Local single-arch dev where `--load` and "just
works" matter more than feature completeness — the default `docker`
driver is fine there.

---

## BUILDX-006 — Prefer native multi-arch runners over QEMU emulation

**What.** `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
under a single-node builder uses QEMU to emulate the non-native
architecture. This is *slow* for CPU-heavy builds — often many times
slower than native. For non-trivial builds, set up a
multi-node builder with one native node per architecture, or use
per-arch CI runners that combine into a manifest list.

**Why.** QEMU emulation tax is real:

- Compilation (gcc, rustc, golang) grinds under emulation.
- Native dependency builds (npm `node-gyp`, Python C extensions, Rust crates) are slowest and sometimes hit bugs unique to emulation.
- Time savings disappear after multiple cache misses.

For small images (single `apt-get install` + scripts), QEMU is fine —
the build is I/O bound, not CPU bound.

**How.** Option 1 — multi-node buildx builder (one builder, multiple
backends):

```bash
# Native amd64 (local)
docker buildx create --name multi --driver docker-container --platform linux/amd64 --node local
# Native arm64 (remote SSH)
docker buildx create --append --name multi --platform linux/arm64 \
  --node remote-arm64 ssh://user@arm64-host
docker buildx use multi

docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t myimage .
# amd64 stage runs on local node, arm64 stage runs on remote, in parallel
```

Option 2 — separate CI jobs per arch, then merge into a manifest list:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml — sketched
jobs:
  build-amd64:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@c3c9e263c25d99ce0380d002d59b67737d91b0dc # v7.4.0
        with:
          platforms: linux/amd64
          tags: ghcr.io/myorg/api:${{ github.sha }}-amd64
          push: true

  build-arm64:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04-arm   # native ARM runner
    steps:
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@c3c9e263c25d99ce0380d002d59b67737d91b0dc # v7.4.0
        with:
          platforms: linux/arm64
          tags: ghcr.io/myorg/api:${{ github.sha }}-arm64
          push: true

  manifest:
    needs: [build-amd64, build-arm64]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          docker buildx imagetools create \
            --tag ghcr.io/myorg/api:${{ github.sha }} \
            ghcr.io/myorg/api:${{ github.sha }}-amd64 \
            ghcr.io/myorg/api:${{ github.sha }}-arm64
```

GitHub now offers free `ubuntu-*-arm` native ARM runners for public
repos; AWS Graviton, Oracle Ampere, and similar cover production-scale
needs.

Cite: [Multi-platform builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/),
[buildx imagetools create](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/imagetools/create/).

**When NOT to apply.** Builds where QEMU overhead is small (tiny
images, I/O-bound steps). Hobby projects where the CI complexity isn't
worth the speedup. Single-arch deployments — don't pay multi-arch tax
at all (SEC-004).

## BUILDX-007 — Use `docker buildx debug build` for interactive step-through of failing builds

**What.** `docker buildx debug build` runs the build under an
interactive debugger; it is still an **experimental** command (enable
with `BUILDX_EXPERIMENTAL=1`). For editor-integrated debugging,
`docker buildx dap build` — no longer behind the experimental flag since
buildx v0.33.0 — speaks the Debug Adapter Protocol so VS Code and other
DAP clients can drive the step-through. When a step fails, you get a shell
*inside the failing step's environment* — same filesystem, same env
vars, same uid — so you can poke at the state that caused the failure
without rebuilding from scratch.

```bash
docker buildx debug --invoke /bin/sh build .
```

Cite: [docker buildx debug reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/debug/),
[docker buildx dap build reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/dap/build/),
[buildx v0.33.0 release](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/v0.33.0).

**Why.** Before buildx debug, the canonical "I need to see what's
inside a failing build" hack was:

```dockerfile
# bad — wedge a sleep + exec into the failing step, then docker exec into it
RUN <thing-that-fails> || sleep 999
```

Then `docker exec -it <containerid> sh` to look around. Several
problems with this:

- Requires editing the Dockerfile (commit, push, hope you remember to
  revert).
- The sleeping container ties up a build slot.
- `docker exec` doesn't necessarily give you the same env as the `RUN`
  step (different PATH, different CWD, different uid depending on
  `USER`).
- Doesn't work for `COPY`/`ADD` failures — those don't run a shell.

`buildx debug build` solves all of these. It rebuilds up to (but not
through) the failing step, drops you into a shell at exactly the
filesystem and environment state the failing step would have seen, and
exits cleanly when you're done. No Dockerfile edits, no orphaned
containers.

It's also useful for *exploration*, not just failure — `buildx debug
build --invoke /bin/sh --on=success .` opens a shell at the end of a
successful build so you can verify the final filesystem state without
running the image.

**How.** Common workflows:

```bash
# Default: shell drops in on the first failing step
docker buildx debug --invoke /bin/sh build .

# Stop at a specific stage's end (useful when iterating mid-build)
docker buildx debug --invoke /bin/sh build --target builder .

# Open a shell on success too (for post-build poking)
docker buildx debug --invoke /bin/sh --on=error --on=success build .

# Use bash if it's installed in the image you're debugging
docker buildx debug --invoke /bin/bash build .
```

Inside the debug shell, useful commands:

- `cat /etc/passwd` — confirm which user the step ran as.
- `env` — see the full environment the step had.
- `ls -la` / `pwd` — verify CWD and visible files.
- `exit` — leaves the debugger. The build does **not** continue;
  buildx debug always halts at the inspected step.

To inspect a build that already failed (without re-running it),
buildx debug also supports replaying from a build's debug state — see
the reference doc for the full set of subcommands (`tree`, `list`,
`continue`).

**When NOT to apply.**

- Builds that work fine — there's no failure to inspect. (`--on=success` is occasionally useful for exploration, but daily.)
- buildx <0.12 — `debug build` doesn't exist; fall back to the `sleep 999` hack until you can upgrade.
- CI pipelines — `debug build` is interactive by definition. For non-interactive build diagnostics, prefer `--progress=plain` to see full step output.

## BUILDX-008 — `--sbom=true --provenance=mode=max` + registry-compatibility caveats

**What.** `docker buildx build --sbom=true --provenance=mode=max` emits
an OCI image **with attestations**: a separate manifest for the SBOM
(Software Bill of Materials) and another for SLSA build provenance.
The result is an OCI manifest *index* that points at the image
manifest plus the two attestation manifests.

The image exporter's documented default is Docker media types
(`oci-mediatypes` defaults to `false`,
[image exporter](https://docs.docker.com/build/exporters/image-registry/)),
but an index carrying attestations must use OCI media types: BuildKit
switches to them when attestations are attached and rejects an explicit
`oci-mediatypes=false` ("cannot export attestations with
\"oci-mediatypes=false\"", `exporter/containerimage/writer.go` in
[moby/buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)). `image-manifest` is
not an image-output option at all: Docker documents it only for cache
exports (`--cache-to`), where it has defaulted to `true` since BuildKit
v0.21 ([cache storage backends](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/)).
So on a current toolchain pushing to a modern registry this round-trips
without extra flags. The catch:
some *older* registries don't accept OCI manifest indexes pointing
at non-image artifacts. ECR (pre-2024), older Harbor versions, and a
handful of internal/self-hosted registries fail the push or fail
subsequent pulls because they expect a manifest list to point at
*platform-image* manifests, not arbitrary attestation manifests.

**Why.** This is the most common "I followed the supply-chain
hardening guide and now my registry is broken" failure. The build
itself succeeds; the push either fails with a cryptic media-type error
or succeeds but subsequent `docker pull` fails with "manifest unknown"
or "unsupported media type." It's misdiagnosed as a build problem when
it's actually a registry-compatibility problem.

Note that *every* `buildx build` that pushes already carries an
attestation: buildx adds a **min-mode provenance attestation by default**,
and it is stored the same way — as an extra manifest in an image
**index**, even for a single-platform image. So `mode=min` is not a
compatibility fallback; only turning attestations off avoids the index.

The fix has two paths depending on what your registry supports:

1. **Set OCI media types explicitly.**
   Modern OCI-compliant registries (ghcr.io, Docker Hub, GitLab,
   Quay, Artifactory ≥7.50, Harbor ≥2.10, ECR as of late 2024) accept
   this and round-trip attestations correctly:

   ```bash
   docker buildx build \
     --sbom=true --provenance=mode=max \
     --output type=image,name=ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:${TAG},push=true,oci-mediatypes=true \
     .
   ```

2. **Turn attestations off for that registry.** `--provenance=false`
   (and no `--sbom`), or `BUILDX_NO_DEFAULT_ATTESTATIONS=1` in the
   environment, pushes a plain image manifest with no index. Sign the
   image out-of-band with cosign (SEC-022) if you still need a
   supply-chain record:

   ```bash
   docker buildx build \
     --provenance=false \
     --output type=image,name=oldregistry.example.com/myapp:${TAG},push=true \
     .
   ```

**`mode=max` records build-arg values.** Max-mode provenance includes
the values of every build argument, and build arguments are visible in
image history too — never pass a secret as `--build-arg` (DOCKER-010,
SEC-006), least of all under `mode=max`.

Cite: [Build attestations](https://docs.docker.com/build/metadata/attestations/),
[SLSA provenance — max](https://docs.docker.com/build/metadata/attestations/slsa-provenance/#max),
[build variables — BUILDX_NO_DEFAULT_ATTESTATIONS](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/variables/#buildx_no_default_attestations).

**How.** Decision: do you control the registry?

- **ghcr.io / Docker Hub / Quay / GitLab Container Registry / modern Harbor / modern ECR** → `mode=max` + `oci-mediatypes=true` and you get full attestations.
- **Older Harbor (<2.10), ECR before late 2024, custom in-house registries you don't control** → push with `--provenance=false` (or `BUILDX_NO_DEFAULT_ATTESTATIONS=1`) and check the registry round-trips it; upgrade the registry before you upgrade attestations.
- **Unsure** → push to a staging tag first, then `docker buildx imagetools inspect <ref>` to see whether the attestation manifests survived the push:

  ```bash
  docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:${TAG} --raw \
    | jq '.manifests[] | {mediaType, digest, "platform.architecture": .platform.architecture, "annotations.in-toto": .annotations."in-toto.io/predicate-type"}'
  ```

  You should see entries with `mediaType:
  application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json` and an `in-toto.io/predicate-type`
  annotation for the attestations. If they're missing, the registry
  stripped them.

BUILDX-008 is the "how to actually push attestations without breaking
the registry" detail; for the broader signing + SBOM workflow (cosign,
syft, sigstore keyless), reach for the dedicated tooling docs.

**When NOT to apply.**

- Projects with no supply-chain threat model — `mode=max` produces large attestations that nobody reads; the default min-mode provenance is enough until there's a reason.
- Single-arch builds being loaded into the local daemon (`--load`) instead of pushed — the daemon's image store handles attestations differently, and you mostly don't care about attestations for local-only images.
- Registries that genuinely refuse attestations entirely (some air-gapped self-hosted setups) — disable them (`--provenance=false`) and sign the image out-of-band with cosign instead. The cosign signature lands in a separate ref, sidestepping the manifest-index issue.

## BUILDX-009 — Use `bake` matrix targets + composable attributes for multi-variant builds

**What.** `docker buildx bake` (GA) matrix targets fork one target
definition into a cartesian product of variants (arch × environment ×
flavor) built in parallel, and composable HCL attributes let
`attest`/`cache-from`/`cache-to` be structured objects that inherit
cleanly instead of fragile CSV strings.

**Why.** Hand-maintaining a separate `docker buildx build ...` command per
variant drifts — someone bumps a cache ref or an attestation flag in one
and forgets the others. A matrix defines the variants once and keeps every
combination in lockstep; composable attributes stop the
`type=registry,ref=...,mode=max` string-concatenation errors.

**How.**

```hcl
# docker-bake.hcl
target "app" {

```bash
docker buildx bake          # builds all matrix entries in parallel
```

**When NOT to apply.** Single-target, single-arch builds — a matrix is
overhead with nothing to vary. Extends BUILDX-004 (use bake at all); this
rule is specifically about the matrix/composable features.

## BUILDX-010 — Pin the Docker GitHub Actions by commit SHA

**What.** Pin `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `docker/build-push-action`,
and `docker/bake-action` (current majors v4 / v7 / v7) to a full commit
SHA, not a floating `@v7` tag.

**Why.** A version tag is mutable — a compromised or hijacked tag runs
attacker-controlled code in your build with registry credentials in
scope (the same supply-chain class as SEC-021). Pinning the SHA makes the
action immutable and auditable. Older majors also predate
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` injection (DOCKER-030) and default attestations, so
the pin doubles as a floor.

**How.**

```yaml
- uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@f87e5991a6d7451dcb8d9637bfbc97413f497069 # v4.4.1
- uses: docker/build-push-action@c3c9e263c25d99ce0380d002d59b67737d91b0dc # v7.4.0
```

Resolve the SHA with
`gh api repos/docker/build-push-action/git/refs/tags/v7.0.0 --jq .object.sha`,
and let Dependabot/Renovate bump the SHA with the version comment.

**When NOT to apply.** Nothing real for CI pipelines — always pin. A
throwaway local experiment that never runs in CI can float.
