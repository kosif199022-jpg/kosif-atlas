# Go Development

Check `go.mod` (`go` and `toolchain` lines) and CI before using version-gated APIs. Project conventions win over these defaults.

## Defaults

- Stdlib first: `net/http`, `testing`, `flag`, `log/slog`. Add a module only for a concrete requirement.
- Concrete types in domain code. Consumers own small private interfaces; producers return concrete types.
- Keep HTTP, CLI, database, and vendor SDK types out of domain packages. Map errors to status, exit code, or retry at the edge.
- New binaries: `cmd/<name>` plus `internal/`. Use `pkg/` only for code meant for external import.
- Avoid package stutter: `user.Store`, not `user.UserStore`.
- Doc comments on exported names start with the identifier and end with a period.
- Every goroutine has an owner, a cancellation path, and a completion path. Use `errgroup` for errors or shared cancellation when the module already has it.

## Version-Gated

- 1.24+: `t.Context()`, `t.Chdir()`, and `b.Loop()` in tests.
- 1.25+: `sync.WaitGroup.Go` when no error propagation is needed.
- 1.26+: stdlib `crypto/hpke`; `new(expr)` only when clearer than a local variable or composite literal; self-referential generic constraints belong in generic libraries, not business logic.
- 1.26+: `testing/cryptotest.SetGlobalRandom` swaps process-wide randomness, so never use it in parallel tests.
- `encoding/json/v2` is experimental and exists only under `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2`; use it only when the project already builds that way.

## CLIs

- Use the existing framework. Otherwise `flag` for single-command tools, Cobra for large command trees with completions, urfave/cli for small multi-command tools. Skip Viper unless already used.
- Keep `main` thin: it calls `run(ctx, args, stdin, stdout, stderr) error` and maps the result to an exit code. Tests call `run`. Avoid `log.Fatal`; it skips deferred cleanup.
- Config precedence: flag, env, config file, default.

## References

- [testing.md](references/testing.md): read when adding or reshaping tests, or when the test loop is slow.
- [linting.md](references/linting.md): read when changing lint commands or golangci-lint config.

Done when the relevant build/test/lint checks pass on what you changed, or you name each check that did not run and why.
