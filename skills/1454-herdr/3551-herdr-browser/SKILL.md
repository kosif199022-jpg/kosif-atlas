# Herdr Browser

Every operation is one command. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not reliable inside an
agent Bash call. Resolve the script from the load-time **"Base directory for this
skill"** banner instead:

```bash
B="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/browser.ts"
bun "$B" open https://news.ycombinator.com
```

Written `B <command>` below — expand it to `bun "$B" <command>` every time.

## Requirements

The browser is [terminal-browser](https://terminal-browser.sh). Every operation
below runs over CDP; only `open`, `new-tab`, `activate`, and `raw` go through its
CLI. When the binary is missing the error names the install command. Never
install it for the user without asking.

## Open a page

```bash
B open https://news.ycombinator.com
B open <url> --new
B open <url> --new --split right|left|down|up --ratio 0.4
```

Loads the URL in the browser that is already open. Opens a new one only when
none is live, or when you pass `--new`.

A new browser gets **its own Herdr tab**, so the pane the human is working in
stays whole. Pass `--split` to carve up the focused pane instead — `--ratio`
sets its share (0.2 to 0.95) and is only valid alongside `--split`.

With several browsers live, every command refuses to guess — pass `--view ID`,
and the error lists the candidates.

## Read and drive the page

```bash
B status                      # url, title, then the tab list
B text                        # page text
B goto <url> | back | forward | reload
B eval <expression>
B selector-click <selector>
B type <selector> <text>
B press [selector] <key>      # Enter, Tab, ArrowDown, Control+a, a
B wait <expression> [timeoutMs]
B click <x> <y> | wheel <x> <y> <deltaY>
B screenshot --output <path> [--full]
B console                     # this page load only; --all keeps older entries
```

Every one answers in one line. A selector that matches nothing, a key that does
not exist, and a URL that fails to resolve all fail loudly — none of them
reports success.

`screenshot` captures the viewport at the device pixel ratio, so the file comes
out twice the CSS size on a retina display.

`--full` captures the whole scroll height into that one file, without touching
the viewport. **Trust it only on a static page.** On a page with scroll-triggered
reveals it fails silently, and in two different ways: run it bare and it returns
wide blank bands, because the composite never scrolls and the reveals never fire;
scroll the page first and it returns the content composited twice, even though
the DOM holds one copy and nothing on the page is `fixed` or `sticky`. Neither
reports an error, and a long page also costs tens of thousands of pixels and
several megabytes.

Such a page has no one height to capture — `scrollHeight` read 12315, then 14247,
then 27295 on the same site as the viewport and the animations changed. Scroll it
and take a viewport shot per screen instead. Enlarging the viewport with `emulate
--size` is not the way around this: Chromium clamps that capture at 16384px, and
the override outlives the command that set it.

`console` reads the buffer the page itself kept, so it covers lines printed
before this command ran, **including uncaught exceptions**. Use `watch` when you
need the network alongside them, or the order between them.

## Debug a page load

```bash
B watch [url]                    # navigate there, or reload, and record
B watch <url> --body <fragment>  # also print that response's body
```

One pass over the load: every request, every console line, and every uncaught
exception, in the order they happened.

```
200 Document http://localhost:8899/
log boot ok
error a deliberate error
404 Fetch http://localhost:8899/missing.json
FAIL Fetch http://localhost:8899/x.json net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
EXCEPTION TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'boom')
```

CDP only reports while attached, so `watch` always drives the load itself — it
cannot report on something that already happened. It stops 1.5s after the last
event, or at 15s.

## Click without guessing a selector

```bash
B snapshot        # 8 button "+1"
B click-ref 8
```

`snapshot` lists only elements worth acting on — links, buttons, fields — as
`ref role name`, and `click-ref` clicks one. Refs survive a detach, so the two
commands may be separate calls, but they die on navigation or re-render.

**When you already know what the thing is called, skip the snapshot entirely:**

```bash
B raw -- find role button click --name "Sign in"
B raw -- find text "Add to cart" click
B raw -- find label Email fill you@example.com
```

`find` locates and acts in one call, and answers `✓ Done`. A snapshot on a real
page costs 5,340 chars before you have clicked anything — this costs seven.
Reach for `snapshot` when you need to discover what is on the page, not when you
already know.

## Viewport

```bash
B emulate --device iphone|ipad|laptop|desktop
B emulate --size 1440x900
```

The override outlives the command that set it, but **a navigation drops it** —
`goto` anywhere and the page is back on the pane's own viewport. There is no
clear either; set the pane's own size back to undo one.

**A pane can sit at a page zoom other than 100%, and that reads as a rendering
bug rather than as a setting.** terminal-browser scales the page zoom by the
terminal's cell-pixel ratio, so changing the terminal font size leaves every
browser pane zoomed, and it stays that way. The tell is an `innerWidth` far
below `outerWidth` against an inflated `devicePixelRatio`:

```bash
B eval 'JSON.stringify([innerWidth,outerWidth,devicePixelRatio])'
# [808,1742,4.312]  — 2.16x too big, and every responsive site in its narrow layout
```

Reset it from outside the browser, naming the pane `open` printed (`view 79456-1
pane w7S:p7`) or one `herdr pane list` reports:

```bash
herdr pane send-keys w7S:p7 cmd+0    # cmd+= and cmd+- step it
```

`B press` cannot do this. It dispatches over CDP into the **page**, and
terminal-browser reads its own shortcuts off the terminal input path, which CDP
never touches. `emulate --size <outerWidth>x<outerHeight>` cancels the zoom's
effect on layout for one document, so reach for it only when you cannot send
keys to the pane.

## Tabs inside the pane

```bash
B tabs                        # 1* https://... Title   — the star is the active tab
B new-tab <url>
B activate <n>                # n is the row number from `tabs`
B close <n>
```

Row numbers come from the pane's own tab strip, so they match what the user
sees. Closing the last tab closes the browser, and the Herdr tab `open` made
goes with it; that prints `closed <view>`.

## Gotchas

**Every pane shares one Chromium process and one CDP port.**
`/json/list` on that port therefore carries other panes' pages too. This script
scopes every command to the pane behind `--view`, but a raw CDP client will not.

`open --new` makes another browser in its own Herdr tab; `new-tab` makes a page
tab inside the browser you already have.

**There is no PDF.** terminal-browser's Chromium is Electron's, and it does not
expose `Page.printToPDF` — CDP answers `'Page.printToPDF' wasn't found`. `B raw
-- pdf` fails the same way, so this is a limit of the browser, not of the skill.

## Cookies and headers

```bash
B cookies                                   # name=value domain/path flags
B cookies set <name> <value> [--url U] [--domain D] [--path P]
                            [--http-only] [--secure] [--same-site Lax] [--expires N]
B cookies clear
B headers '{"Authorization":"Bearer ..."}'  # on every request from now on
```

`eval 'document.cookie'` reaches only what JS may read: it never sees an
httpOnly cookie and cannot write one. These go over CDP and do. Use `eval` for
`localStorage` and `sessionStorage` — JS owns those outright.

**Chrome answers a cookie it rejects with success, not an error.** A wrong
domain, or `--secure` on an http page, is a silent no-op at the protocol level.
`cookies set` turns that into a failure.

`headers` replaces the whole set — pass `{}` to clear.

**`cookies clear` empties the whole browser, not the current site.** `cookies`
reads only the current page's cookies, so the pair reads as if both were scoped
to it — they are not. `clear` is `Network.clearBrowserCookies`, and the profile
behind it is shared and on disk, so one call logs every pane out of every site,
permanently. To drop one cookie, overwrite it with `cookies set <name> ""
--expires 1` instead.

## Logging in

A login persists on its own — terminal-browser keeps one Chromium profile on
disk, and it survives a browser close. There is only that one, and every pane
shares it, so a login is global and outlives the session that made it. Read
`references/auth.md` before logging in anywhere, and for what an agent can read
off a logged-in page.

## Everything else — the raw escape hatch

```bash
B raw -- cookies set session abc123 --url https://example.com --httpOnly
B raw -- cookies get
B raw -- route '**/api/**' --abort
B raw -- har start /tmp/run.har
B raw -- vitals
```

`raw` hands everything after `--` to agent-browser, the CLI terminal-browser
bundles. It reaches what JS through `eval` cannot: httpOnly cookies, request
mocking, HAR, traces, video, Core Web Vitals, axe-core audits.

Read its surface with `B raw -- <command> --help` rather than guessing flags —
`cookies set` takes `<name> <value>`, not `name=value`, and the wrong shape
fails as a CDP error, not a usage error.

Prefer a native command when one exists. Use `B snapshot`, never `raw --
snapshot`: agent-browser prints the whole accessibility tree (~5x larger).

agent-browser keeps state across separate `raw` calls — a `route`, a `storage
local set`, or `headers` outlives the command that made it, because a daemon
holds it.

## External CDP clients

```bash
B endpoint    # view, cdp_http, browser_ws
```

Use the browser-level endpoint so the client can drive multiple tabs.

- Playwright: `chromium.connectOverCDP(cdp_http)`; Playwright MCP:
  `--cdp-endpoint=<cdp_http>`.
- Chrome DevTools MCP: `--browser-url=<cdp_http>`.
- Browser Use: `BU_CDP_URL=<cdp_http>` or `BU_CDP_WS=<browser_ws>`.

The client sees every pane's pages, per the gotcha above.

terminal-browser owns Chromium: disconnecting a client leaves it running,
closing the pane closes the browser.

## OpenCode only — skip on Claude Code and Codex

There is no banner and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty. Set the path directly:

```bash
B=~/.config/opencode/skills/herdr-browser/scripts/browser.ts
bun "$B" status
