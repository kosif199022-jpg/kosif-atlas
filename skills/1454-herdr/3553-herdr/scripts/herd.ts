/**
 * herd.ts — a small, typed wrapper over the raw `herdr` CLI for in-session
 * agent orchestration. Collapses herdr's multi-step recipes (create pane → start →
 * prompt → wait → read) into ten verbs an agent can call without re-deriving the
 * CLI's sharp edges:
 *
 *   spawn   — start an agent in a fresh pane under a collision-proof name
 *   tell    — hand work to an ALREADY-RUNNING agent, addressed by project label
 *   ask     — like tell, but waits for and returns the answer via a result-file contract
 *   collect — redeem a pending `ask`'s answer later, without re-asking
 *   send    — write a prompt to a running agent AND submit it (Enter)
 *   keys    — send bare key chords to the agent's pane
 *   wait    — block until the agent reaches a status
 *   read    — read a pane's recent output as clean text
 *   list    — the current agents as a typed array
 *   close   — close an agent's pane
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Targets are addressed by NAME, never by pane id. Names follow an agent when
 *   a cross-workspace move gives its pane a new workspace-qualified id.
 * - One `agent prompt` command handles text, paste mode, submission timing, and Enter.
 * - `agent start` launches only in an existing pane, so `spawn` creates the pane
 *   first and puts environment variables on that pane.
 * - Runnable both as a CLI (`bun herd.ts <verb> …`) and as a module
 *   (`import { createHerd } from "./herd.ts"`) so relay can consume the same
 *   layer for a future live-pane strategy.

 * dashboard` narrows two agents sharing a workspace down to one, and

 *
 * An exact name or pane id short-circuits. Both are unique by construction, so
 * neither may be diluted by some other agent whose cwd happens to contain it —
 * and for the pane id the short-circuit is what makes it the escape hatch at
 * all. Two tabs in one workspace may carry the SAME label, which makes their
 * `workspace/tab` addresses identical and leaves a caller resolving an ambiguity
 * no readable fragment can split; the pane id always can. Substring matching
 * alone would not deliver that: pane numbers are unpadded, so `w6:p1` is a
 * substring of `w6:p10` and the escape hatch would re-fail exactly in the busy
 * workspace that needed it.
