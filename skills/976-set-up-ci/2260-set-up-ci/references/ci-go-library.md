# Go Library CI Workflow

Use this template for Go library projects (no `main.go` at root, no `cmd/` directory). The minimum Go version is read from `go.mod` automatically. Uses two `cboone/gh-actions` reusable workflow calls: one for the minimum supported Go version (all checks, reads `go.mod`) and one for the latest stable Go release (test, vet and lint).

```yaml

  push:
    branches: [main]

## Notes

- Two reusable workflow calls implement the Go version matrix: `ci-minimum` reads the minimum version from `go.mod` and runs all checks; `ci-stable` runs test, vet and lint against the latest stable Go release
- Each call creates its own set of parallel jobs internally
- Libraries benefit from multi-version testing more than CLIs because consumers may use older Go versions
- `run-lint: true` enables golangci-lint with SHA-256 verification
- `run-lint` installs golangci-lint 2.13.2, up from 2.11.4 before v4.1.0. A first run on the newer release can report findings the older one did not. Pin `golangci-lint-version` to a known release while working through them.
- `run-format-check: true` enables the gofmt/goimports formatting check
- `run-build: true` enables the `go build ./...` check
- The stable call passes no `run-*` inputs, so it runs test, vet and lint: `run-lint` defaults to true, while `run-format-check` and `run-build` default to false. Formatting and build results do not vary by Go version, so leaving those two off is deliberate. Lint results do not vary either, so set `run-lint: false` on this call if the duplicate golangci-lint run is not worth the runner time
