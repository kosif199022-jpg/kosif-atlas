# chapter review

Open the reply with `devbook-collaboration@<version>`, `version` read from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not recalled.

## Purpose

Review one chapter and leave the verdict where the next reader will find it: in
the chapter, as its open annotation fences. Findings are recorded, not merely
reported, so an unanswered question survives the session that raised it.

A finding is an annotation fence, never a `meta` field, and the chapter
carries no review state — `devbook-chapter-metadata.md` says why.
`devbook-annotations.md` has the fence's schema and lifecycle, and
devbook's `.devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/annotations.mjs` is the only thing that
writes one. Read
both first.

This file exceeds the 40-line body budget on purpose: the lens table in step 3
is one row per thing a chapter can be wrong about, and a review that skips a
lens is a review that misses the finding.

## Steps

1. **Load the chapter and its neighbours.** Read the chapter, then the chapters
   one step away through `related` and `depends-on`. Walk those edges; never
   search the folder. Load nothing else — a review is scoped to what the chapter
   claims and what it leans on.

2. **Read the existing notes.** List them, and take every open one as input to
   this pass, exactly as a pull request's unresolved comments would be —
   questions to answer, never facts about the domain:

   ```
   node .devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/annotations.mjs list --chapter <path#slug>
   ```

   Whoever raised one, it counts. A question somebody else left open is still a
   hole in the chapter.

3. **Review through each lens** that applies to the chapter's folder:

   | Lens | Ask |
   |---|---|
   | Truth | Does the chapter still describe what the code and the product actually do? |
   | Evidence | Does every claim that could be proven carry a `tests` entry, and does the named test still exist? |
   | Edges | Does every `related` and `depends-on` target resolve, and is each one a real relationship rather than a stale one? |
   | Vocabulary | Are the terms the ones `domain.md` defines, used the way it defines them? |
   | Status | Does `status` match reality — a `draft` that shipped, a `deprecated` still in use, a `tech/` rating nobody has revisited? |
   | Scope | Does the chapter say one thing, or has a second subject grown inside it that wants its own chapter? |
   | Gaps | What does a reader need that the chapter does not say? |

   Report every finding with its severity, the evidence for it, and the change
   that would settle it. Skip style — a review that files a wording preference
   next to a wrong invariant has buried the invariant.

4. **Resolve what you can.** Fix what is unambiguously wrong and within the
   chapter, in the same change. For each note you actually settled, `reply` with
   the answer and then `resolve` it — the reply is what makes the exchange
   readable in the pull request that raised it. Leave a note that needs a
   decision, needs the author, or needs work outside the chapter: one you read
   but did not act on stays open for whoever raised it.

5. **Write each remaining finding as a fence**, one per objection, `--author`
   yourself, `--after` naming the passage when it is about one:

   ```
   node .devbook/_tools/devbook-meta/annotations.mjs add --chapter <path#slug> --after "<the passage>" --kind question --author <you> --body "<the finding>"
   ```

   `--kind question` when the chapter cannot be judged until somebody answers;
   `flag` when the objection should be the first thing the approver reads —
   the gate shows flags first and never blocks on one; `suggestion` or
   `comment` otherwise.

6. **Read the verdict off the fences.** Write no field for it:

   | Outcome | Verdict | Next move |
   |---|---|---|
   | An open fence remains | Changes requested | The author's, answering the notes |
   | None does | Cleared | Whoever approves — `chapter-approve` in `domain/` |

   Cleared says the chapter is ready for a person to decide on. It is not the
   approval.

7. **Report** the findings, the verdict, who owes the next move, and what you
   changed. Commit the chapter and its notes together, and stop.

## On a change

A target under `openspec/changes/<name>/` is reviewed as one: load
`proposal.md` and every delta under `devbook-delta/` in step 1, with each
delta's target chapter as it stands and the chapters `solution.md` names —
the neighbours a change leans on. Run `delta.mjs --check <name>`; each error
is a finding. Write each fence on the file it is about. Cleared hands the whole
change to `chapter-approve`.

## Do not

- Do not write `status: approved` from here. A review that could approve itself
  is not a gate, and the rung is `chapter-approve`'s to write.
- Do not treat a note as chapter content, and do not carry one into a change
  brief, a specification, or any other chapter. An open question is a reason to
  stop, not a line item to implement.
- Do not close a finding you did not settle, and do not sweep a resolved one
  here — the answer has to survive into the pull request that raised the
  question. Sweeping is `devbook:annotation-sweep`, before the branch merges.
- Do not widen the review to the folder. One chapter and its neighbours; a
  folder-wide sweep is `chapter-review-queue`.
