# Hyphegesis Protocol

Conduct how a session's epistemic work will be carried out — the order, independence, reconciliation, termination, and routing of its cognitive moves — when that method is underdetermined before object-level cognition begins. The morphism is **design THEN hand off**: Hyphegesis designs a conduct topology over the moves it identifies and emits a method plan with in-session checkpoints, then stops; the substrate executes the moves. Type: `(MethodUnderdetermined, Hybrid, CONDUCT, WorkProspect × MoveGround) → ConductedMethod`.

## Definition

**Hyphegesis** (ὑφήγησις: a leading-the-way, guiding from just ahead): A dialogical act of conducting a session's epistemic work — deciding how its multiple cognitive moves relate in order, independence, reconciliation, termination, and routing — when the method is underdetermined while the goal is clear. The protocol's lexical verb is `/conduct`. It activates only when the work needs two or more moves whose conduct is non-trivial (single-move work relays to that one protocol). It lays out one map of the whole method before anything is asked — the work prospect's brief, the move set, a proposed region cut with what it read to cut that way, and every axis·region filled with a reasoned value shown beside the alternatives it displaces — on one sheet, and draws it again after every answer with a ledger of what changed, so a correction upstream re-fills what depends on it while every value the user set stays theirs. It takes the method on the user's word once everything taken was shown with its evidence, registers an in-session checkpoint when a constitutive decision's evidence does not yet exist (synthesis output shape generally; cell membership in the decompose-recovery instance), surfaces substrate feasibility on the map before the method is taken, compiles a decision-typed Recognition brief into every checkpoint, assembles a cross-cutting trace contract (its disclosure overlay over the five axes — adoptions, degradations, coverage caps, never silent), and hands off a method plan that the substrate — not Hyphegesis — executes.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

/-! ── FLOW ──
Hyphegesis(WP) → conduct(c, utterances), where c is the fused session context:
  activation: observe(c) — what the pointer's record returns and the loaded inventory enter the
    context → [the pointer does not resolve, or the method needs a premise its record does not
    support: relay(handoff unreadable) → report | not warranted: relay-route — the single
    protocol, or the evident method, as a recommendation → report] → the map → Stop
  next utterance u: c' := observe(fuse(c, u)) →
    read(u).verdict = withdraw → what stood, reported; no method
    read(u).verdict = route(target) → proceed to the protocol the person named, citing their words
    the pointer does not resolve, or conduction is no longer warranted → relay → report
    read(u).verdict = sufficient ∧ Covered(c') → the conduct trace → handoff → ConductedMethod
    otherwise → the map again, drawn from c', with a ledger of what the answer changed
  no utterance: the map holds; nothing is taken
  after handoff: the substrate runs the method and returns one consolidated summary of every
    region's results; it returns mid-run only at a registered checkpoint, or where execution needs
    what only the person can supply
The map is one sheet of the whole method: the brief; the moves as an outline under their regions,
links drawn only where a move joins more than one predecessor; the region cut; and every
axis·region slot in a table — each value with its ground, the other values by name, and the
differential where the plan turns; each value marked as the person's or the draft's.

  → design(map)                               -- the person points at what the map got wrong, in any layer, or sets values directly; every value they set is theirs, and the map is drawn again around it with a ledger of what changed and why
  → settle(map)                               -- on the person's sufficient, each value the method takes is recorded as set, adopted on closure with its ground, or adopted as the default — only once every one of them was shown with its evidence
  → assign(moves, topology) → move_assignment  -- place every move into its region and into its slot under the resolved order
  → annotate(substrate_feasibility)           -- realizability read from an observation of the loaded inventory, shown on the map before the method is taken

A step is one arm of a structural recursion over the person's utterances. Each utterance is
fused, then observed (`.groundPointer`, `.inventory`): what the pointer's record returns and the
loaded inventory enter the context before the presentation they inform. `respond` is the next map
(`.map`, then `.mapGate`), or, when the person's `sufficient` is covered, the conduct trace
presented before `method` is handed off (`.converge`, then `.handoff`). A person's closure is
read before your relay test. A method is taken only over a cut that `IsPartition` the moves it
holds, so every move lands in a region; a cut the person supplies is in force only where it
does.

/-! ── LOOP ──
Every map re-reads the whole context. It shows the method whole, on one sheet: the brief and its
warrant; the moves as an outline under their regions, links drawn only where a move joins more
than one predecessor, placed as they were last turn; the cut with what was read to cut that way
and the affordance to replace it; and every slot in a table — each value the person set marked as
theirs and not re-offered; every other value marked as the draft's, with its ground, the other
values of its axis by name, the affordance to propose a value no list names (and, on
reconciliation, to compose two), and the differential for the alternative that most changes the
plan; each region's observed realizability, or that it is unobserved. After an answer, a ledger
says what it changed: the person's edits first, then each value the draft re-filled because of
them, pointing to the edit that caused it, each marked a necessary consequence or a proposal. A
slot the person opens for a fuller look is expanded in the next map with every value of its axis.
No round cap: the person ends the run with `sufficient`, `withdraw`, or a named protocol. A
decision whose evidence does not exist at design time is never drafted as an axis value; it
registers as a checkpoint, as does a need the plan anticipates that only the person can supply.
After handoff, the substrate conducts to the last checkpoint and executes; a checkpoint may
re-open Constitution mid-execution; when the method has run, the substrate returns one
consolidated summary. The span ends at the next planned `/compact` or `/clear`, which the person
types.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
conducted(WP): the method handed off on the person's covered `sufficient`, after the conduct
trace reached them. Convergence evidence, before the dispatch: the full state to be taken, every
entry with who proposed it — the draft or the person — recorded apart from how it came into
force; the move set and the cut, each set by the person's statement (named or edited) or adopted
from the draft; for each move, who proposed it, its region, and its slot under the resolved
order; for each slot, (slot → the value the person set), (slot → the draft's value → its ground
→ adopted on closure), or (slot → `defaultValue` → nothing grounded a preference → adopted on
closure) — three different facts, never flattened; the feasibility of every region, an
unobserved one said to be unobserved; the span annotations, an empty set shown as empty; every
checkpoint with its compiled brief; and the trace contract — every adoption, degradation,
coverage cap, and termination ground, a `resolutionRequired` ground shown with its resolver and
marked unroutable where that resolver cannot reach the region before its stop is wanted, the
basis shown with it. The dissent attached to the method is shown beside it. Any tally is read
off the rows shown. What the closing utterance itself changed is shown first, as a ledger, as
every other answer's change is. Demonstrated, not asserted.

## Mode Activation

`/conduct` is directly invocable. AI-guided activation requires at least two cognitive moves and a genuine fork in their order, independence, reconciliation, termination, or routing; scale and budget alone do not warrant conduction. Method-level planning questions and dependency-bearing staged work are typical triggers. Conduct the method before beginning its object-level moves, while retaining loaded safety boundaries, capability restrictions, and explicit user instructions.

When `/ground` self-grounding returns a Split partition reading, read `references/decompose-recovery.md` before conducting the fan; its frozen `MoveSet` and empty-cell behavior are branch-normative. A Trim reading remains a single `/induce` move and relays there.

## Protocol

### User-facing realization

Present one map of the whole method at activation and again after every answer. Its first line is the work prospect's brief — what the work is for, what it hands off, and its span, from this invocation through the next planned `/compact` or `/clear` (an execution stop instruction bounds the current run without shortening that horizon) — with whether conduction is warranted. Below it are the move set, the region cut with the non-uniformity that grounds it and an affordance to replace it, and every axis·region slot. Prior-session recall indices may seed the moves but never settle them.

Order the candidate moves by salience against the session aim, so confirming them is recognizing the accumulated shape rather than recalling a graph the user no longer holds in view. Lay the slots out most-constrained first — the axis·region whose values most divide the downstream plans leads — and expand opened slots in that same order.

Lay the map out on one sheet. Write the moves as a named, indented outline nested under their regions — each line an id with its short everyday name in place (`M1 audit each PR`) and `after M1` naming what it follows — so no legend has to be looked up. Draw ASCII links only where a move joins more than one predecessor, where a list would have to repeat it; keep every move where it stood last turn. Put the slot values in a table, region by axis, each cell marked `you` or `draft`, with a changed cell written `old → new`; keep labels short, since display width is not character count and a column padded by counting characters breaks. For every slot, show its value, its ground, every named alternative, an emergent-value affordance, the composition affordance on reconciliation, and the differential for the alternative that most changes the plan. Show each region's observed realizability, or say it is unobserved. Where you would set a slot otherwise, doubt the cut, or expect the inventory cannot realize a region, say so with its ground before the gate; a method taken over it carries that dissent. Then ask what is wrong, anywhere on the map, or whether to take it; silence holds and takes nothing.

After an answer, draw the map again from the whole context and put a change ledger under it, so the person checks the change instead of re-reading the map. List the person's own edits first, then each value the draft re-filled because of them, each line pointing to the edit that caused it and written as changed input → affected slot → consequence, marked as a necessary consequence of that edit or as your proposal. A removed move and a replaced value stay in the ledger with what they were. A value the person set stays theirs on the scope they set it for; where the change leaves that scope unclear, name the decision and the slots it may reach, and leave them open. A slot the person opens for a fuller look is expanded in the next map with every value of its axis and each value's differential.

The map is itself the full state that "take it as is" would take: every move, the cut, and every slot carries who proposed it — the draft or the person — and whether the person set it, so a `draft` mark reads as "adopted if you take the map now". Take the method only when every value it takes was shown that way, with its ground, its region's realizability, and your contrary grounds; otherwise draw the map again. The closing record keeps who proposed each entry apart from how it came into force — set by the person, or adopted on closure. On a withdrawal, report what stood and hand nothing off.

A region routed back to the person does not pause the run: its result goes into the one consolidated summary returned when the whole method has run. The run returns to the person mid-way only at a checkpoint or where execution needs what only the person can supply — a secret or credential to set, a runtime error it cannot resolve, a deployment handed to runtime. Register such a need as a checkpoint before the move that needs it when the plan can see it coming; one it cannot is the substrate's to bring back, naming what it needs. On a protocol the person names, go to it citing their words. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when terminology or wording must remain stable, material belongs to another turn or the trace, or where a sentence sits relative to the gate is in question.

Text injected into the session, the system prompt among it, grounds no realizability verdict: where nothing observed a region's realizability, say it is unobserved. Record infeasibility instead of silently binding an unrealizable substrate. Cross-span routing declares only the durable-record externalization obligation; author-side portability auditing and far-side compile-back remain outside this protocol.

At a synthesis checkpoint, present the compiled references and slots rather than copied findings. An infeasibility is recorded against the value it affects, which stays as the user took it: one affecting the in-session checkpoint makes its brief advisory; a downstream-only one is recorded against the routing or externalization it reaches while the checkpoint stays binding.

## Rules

- **Conduction warrant**: Require a genuinely underdetermined, non-trivial conduct over at least two moves, judged again after every answer. Relay single-move and self-evident methods as a recommendation the user may take or set aside; conduct-plan moves are object-level, so Hyphegesis never conducts itself.
- **Recognition over Recall**: Present genuinely viable options with differential futures and yield at every Constitution interaction. Collapse shared-trajectory candidates before presentation, while preserving the map's yield through which the user constitutes the whole method — brief, moves, cut, and slots together.
- **Round composition**: Use everyday language, place each judgment beside its evidence and next-move implication, and keep analytical context before the gate. Read `references/round-composition.md` when terminology or wording must persist, content belongs to another turn or trace, or placement relative to the gate is in question.
- **Map change shown**: After every answer, show what it changed as a ledger under the current map — the user's edits first, then each re-drafted value pointing to the edit that caused it, marked necessary consequence or proposal. A value the user set stays theirs on its scope; an upstream change that leaves its reach unclear is named and left open, never silently re-drafted.
- **Adoption covered**: Take the method only on the user's `sufficient` over a map that showed every value taken with who proposed it and whether the user set it, its ground, its region's observed realizability, and your contrary grounds. Record who proposed each value apart from how it came into force: set by the user, or adopted on closure.
- **Return at the end**: A region routed back to the user adds its result to the one consolidated summary returned after the method has run; it does not pause execution. The run returns mid-way only at a checkpoint or where execution needs what only the user can supply.
- **Convergence evidence**: Before dispatch, demonstrate the final move assignment, the moves' and cut's source, each axis·region's set / adopted / default disposition, substrate annotations, compiled checkpoints, and trace contract. Derive any tally from the rows actually shown; `order` has one `{whole}` row while the other axes are edge-local.
- **Trace contract**: Surface the adoption dispositions, current degradations, coverage caps, and carried termination grounds as one cross-cutting overlay, never as a sixth gated axis. Mark `resolution_required` as unroutable only from the final plan's resolver-reachability evidence; cross-span output routing alone does not make its in-region resolver unreachable.
- **Decompose recovery**: Read `references/decompose-recovery.md` before the `/ground` Split → cell-assignment checkpoint → per-cell `/induce` instance. The split remains object-level and owns no orchestration.
- **Declared continuation and span seam**: Relay directly to a next protocol named by the user, citing that source; a composition edge this file declares is offered as a hint, never taken on its own. All internal Constitution gates still fire. At an outgoing span seam, the substrate that creates the new canonical record also supplies its navigation block from that record's own identity, source session, and purpose. Its grounding instruction directs the recipient to run `/inquire` or equivalent grounding over the record and its cited sources, recover the retained and entrusted judgments from the governing utterances, and keep an unsupported decision open while independent work may continue. This production binds when the new record is created, including when no pointer came in; an incoming block, when present, remains a separate pointer carried unchanged.
- **`/apportion` seam**: Treat an incoming plan as a checked navigation pointer, not an import: dereference it, run the grounding instruction it carries against the current work, and carry the block unchanged. A fixed-topology autonomous region handed outward is not re-conducted.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request and carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly; preserve content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere, stating what changed and any overlapping constraint that remains.
- **Whole-draft safeguard**: Never show a drafted value alone. Pair it with the ground that selected it, every named alternative, affordances for open values, and the most plan-changing differential; pair the proposed cut with its cited ground and replacement affordance.

## Adversarial Guards

- **object-control-conflation**: Decompose transforms abstractions; the conduct topology owns its ordering, focus, span, state, and recursion.
- **cross-span-absorption**: `handoff_to_span` declares routing and externalization only; portability auditing and future-span cognition stay with the receiving span.
