/**
 * Concord — hook plumbing.
 *
 * Reading the payload Codex hands a hook, and the safety wrapper every
 * entrypoint runs inside.
 *
 * The governing rule: a hook must never break the user's session. Every handler
 * exits 0 — including on internal error — and failures go to a log file, never
 * to stderr. A memory plugin that can wedge Codex is worse than no memory
 * plugin at all.
 *
 * Payload contract, per codex-rs `hooks/src/events/`: the payload is JSON on
 * stdin. SessionStart carries session_id, transcript_path, cwd, hook_event_name,
 * model, permission_mode, source. None of it is assumed present — every field is
 * probed and falls back, because hooks are experimental and the shape may move.
