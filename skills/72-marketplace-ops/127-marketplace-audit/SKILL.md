  Validates the integrity of any Claude Code plugin marketplace. Use PROACTIVELY before any commit that modifies plugin files or marketplace.json.
  TRIGGER WHEN: verifying marketplace.json integrity, finding orphan plugins/skills/agents/commands, checking dependency resolution or cycles, confirming documented plugin counts still match README and docs tables, or checking naming conventions.
  DO NOT TRIGGER WHEN: content quality review (use marketplace-review) or scaffolding new plugins (use marketplace-scaffold-plugin / skills-creator).

# Marketplace Audit

Run a comprehensive structural validation of any Claude Code plugin marketplace. Works against any project that follows the standard `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugins/<name>/` layout.

## Audit steps

### Step 1: Run the validation script

Execute the audit script to get a machine-readable report:

```bash
# Validate only
python "<plugin-root>/skills/marketplace-audit/scripts/audit_marketplace.py"

# Validate and auto-fix color issues (invalid, missing, disharmonious)
python "<plugin-root>/skills/marketplace-audit/scripts/audit_marketplace.py" --fix
```

The script resolves the target project root by walking up from the script location, or respects a `--project-root <path>` flag if invoking it from a different marketplace than where the plugin is installed.

### Step 2: Review findings

The script checks:

1. **File existence** -- every path in marketplace.json `agents` / `skills` / `commands` arrays resolves to a real file or directory
2. **Orphaned files** -- agent `.md` files, skill directories, or command `.md` files on disk not registered in any plugin
3. **Frontmatter validation**
   - Agents: must have `name`, `description`, `model`, `color`
   - Skills: must have `name`, `description`
   - Commands: must have `description`
4. **Color consistency and harmony**
   - All agents within a plugin should use the same color
   - Warn when a single color is overused across too many plugins (threshold configurable)
   - Report color distribution across all plugins
   - Valid colors: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan
   - Use `--fix` to auto-correct invalid or missing colors
5. **Naming conventions**
   - All names are kebab-case
   - Agent filename matches frontmatter `name` field
   - Plugin directory name matches marketplace.json `name` field
   - Skill directory name matches frontmatter `name` field
   - Workflow command output directories match command filename (e.g., `feature-e2e.md` typically writes to `.feature-e2e/`)
   - No naming collisions between commands in different plugins
   - No em dash characters anywhere (use hyphen `-` or double hyphen `--`)
6. **Cross-reference consistency (project-specific, best-effort)**
   - If a git remote is configured, suggest that the marketplace `name` align with the repo name (warning only)
   - If a `CLAUDE.md` is present at the project root, suggest that its project header match the marketplace name (warning only)
   - These are advisory -- different marketplace maintainers have different conventions
7. **Marketplace.json schema**
   - Every plugin has: `name`, `source`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `keywords`, `category`, `strict`
   - No duplicate plugin names
   - Duplicate keywords across plugins (warning only -- may be intentional)
8. **Version sanity**
   - All versions are valid semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
   - `metadata.version` is present at the root
9. **Dependency resolution and acyclicity**
   - An unqualified `dependencies` entry must name a plugin in this marketplace
   - A cross-marketplace entry must use the qualified `name@marketplace` form, which is checked for shape only, since it is unresolvable from here by design. A bare name silently resolves against the local marketplace and fails the whole plugin load, so the qualified form is mandatory, not stylistic
   - The hard-dependency graph must be acyclic. Optional dependencies are excluded from the cycle walk on purpose: they exist precisely to express an edge that would otherwise close a loop
   - External marketplaces are reported as info, grouped by which plugins require them
10. **Documentation count drift**
   - Per-plugin agent, skill, and command counts restated in `docs/README.md`'s index table and in `README.md`'s plugin table must match what marketplace.json declares
   - Rows naming a plugin that is not registered, and registered plugins missing from a table that already lists the others, are both flagged
   - Every `N plugins` phrase in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the marketplace `metadata.description` must match the real plugin count
   - This is the check that catches the most common silent decay: adding or removing one file leaves every table that counted it stale, and nothing else fails. Each sub-check is skipped when the file or the table is absent, so it stays valid for marketplaces with a different documentation layout

### Step 3: Fix issues

Address findings by severity:

- **CRITICAL**: Missing referenced files, broken paths, missing required frontmatter fields, duplicate plugin names
- **WARNING**: Orphaned files, naming mismatches, overlapping keywords, color inconsistencies, git/CLAUDE.md alignment
- **INFO**: Suggestions for improvement, consolidation opportunities

### Step 4: Evaluate color harmony

After the script passes, review the color distribution and evaluate semantic harmony:

1. Read each plugin's description and category from marketplace.json
2. Consider domain: similar domains should have visually related colors; distinct domains should contrast
3. Guiding principles:
   - Warm colors (red, orange, yellow, pink) for creative / outward-facing plugins
   - Cool colors (blue, cyan, purple) for analytical / development plugins
   - Neutral (green) for tooling / infrastructure
4. If colors feel disharmonious, propose a new assignment with reasoning and apply after user confirmation

### Step 5: Re-validate

Run the script again after fixes to confirm a clean audit.

## Notes for marketplace maintainers

- This skill is marketplace-agnostic. It assumes the standard Claude Code plugin layout (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `plugins/<name>/`) but makes no assumption about which plugins, authors, or upstream sources are specific to your marketplace.
- Plugin categories, default author, upstream sources, and any project-specific conventions should be documented in your `CLAUDE.md` at the project root. The script and this skill respect those conventions but do not enforce a particular taxonomy.
