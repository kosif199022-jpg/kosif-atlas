# Instagram profile media: the observed surface

Everything here was captured from a live session on 2026-09-10, not inferred.
Where a value is known to rotate, the text says so and names what the tooling
reads instead of hardcoding it.

## Anonymous access is closed

Three probes, three refusals:

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/users/web_profile_info/?username=<u>` on `www.instagram.com` | `401` `{"require_login": true, "igweb_rollout": true}` |
| the same path on `i.instagram.com` | identical `401` |
| `GET /<username>/?__a=1&__d=dis` | `201` with an empty body |

A logged-out browser loading a profile renders `PolarisLoggedOutDesktopWWWProfile`
for a moment and then navigates to
`/accounts/login/?source=desktop_dynamic_landing_dialog`. No post link ever
reaches the DOM, and the only `api/graphql` bodies are 125 to 231 byte telemetry
payloads. Adding an `x-ig-app-id` header does not change any of this.

Conclusion: a profile grab needs a session. Plan for the login, do not plan
around it.

## The login form changed

`input[name="username"]` and `input[name="password"]` no longer exist. The form
carries:

| Control | Selector |
|---|---|
| account | `input[name="email"]` with `autocomplete="username webauthn"` |
| password | `input[name="pass"]` |
| submit | a `div` with `role=button` labelled `Accedi` or `Log in`, not a `button[type=submit]` |

The Meta cookie dialog renders on top of the form and its container swallows
every click underneath, so Playwright reports `subtree intercepts pointer
events` on the submit control until the dialog is answered. Dismiss it first
(`Consenti tutti i cookie`, `Allow all cookies`, or either refusal variant),
then fill the form.

## The EU pay-or-consent wall

Inside the EU a freshly logged-in account is redirected to

```
/consent/?flow=ad_free_subscription&source=ad_free_subscription_blocking_flow
```

and every navigation lands on the home feed until that flow is answered. The
symptom is misleading: a `goto` to the profile appears to succeed, but the
captured queries are `PolarisFeedRootPaginationCachedQuery`, the home feed,
rather than the profile grid.

This is a decision about advertising and payment on someone's account, so
automation should park on it and let a human answer, then persist the resulting
storage state so it is answered once rather than every run.

## The profile grid query

```
POST https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
fb_api_req_friendly_name = PolarisProfilePostsTabContentQuery_connection
doc_id = 39535953862670189            (observed 2026-09-10, rotates)
```

The body also carries `fb_dtsg`, `lsd`, `jazoest`, `__csr`, `__hs`, `__rev` and
a dozen more session-scoped values. **Do not reconstruct them.** Capture one
genuine request the page issues on its own, keep it as a template, and re-post
it with only `variables.after` swapped. That keeps the `doc_id` rotation and the
token scheme out of the tooling entirely.

`variables` of interest:

```json
{"after": "<cursor>", "before": null, "first": 12, "last": null,
 "username": "<profile>", "include_multi_captions": true,
 "data": {"count": 12, "include_relationship_info": true}}
```

The cursor is `<media_pk>_<user_id>`, for example
`3374869699831538610_3041758876`. Passing `after: null` returns page one.

Response shape:

```
data.xdt_api__v1__feed__user_timeline_graphql_connection
  edges[].node        96 fields
  page_info           {end_cursor, has_next_page, has_previous_page, start_cursor}
```

## The newest 24 posts are not in that query

This is the trap worth remembering. Instagram delivers the first 24 posts inside
the initial page payload, and the first `_connection` request the client issues
**already carries a deep cursor**. A collector that only listens to network
traffic therefore captures the timeline from post 25 onward and silently misses
the most recent ones. Observed directly: with 24 post links already in the DOM,
the first sniffed page returned posts dated 2024-05-20 to 2024-02-19 on a
profile whose newest post was 2026-07-02.

The fix is to stop listening passively. Use the captured template to walk the
timeline from `after: null`, which asks the same genuine endpoint for page one.

## Node fields that matter

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `code` | shortcode, the `/p/<code>/` permalink and a stable file key |
| `pk`, `id` | numeric media ids, `pk` is the cursor's left half |
| `taken_at` | unix seconds |
| `media_type` | `1` image, `2` video, `8` carousel |
| `product_type` | `feed`, `clips` (a reel), `carousel_container` |
| `image_versions2.candidates` | several sizes of the same still, ordering not guaranteed |
| `video_versions` | several entries, often one resolution under type ids `101`, `102`, `103` |
| `carousel_media` | child nodes, each with its own `image_versions2` and `video_versions` |
| `caption.text`, `accessibility_caption` | copy, useful for alt text |
| `original_width`, `original_height` | the uploaded dimensions |

Select the largest candidate by `width * height` rather than trusting index `0`,
and treat a child with a non-empty `video_versions` as a video whatever its
declared `media_type` says.

Real distribution on a 180 post profile: 160 images, 12 reels, 8 carousels,
expanding to 193 files. Largest candidate observed was 3072x4096, so the grab is
full resolution and not a thumbnail scrape.

## Downloading

Media sit on `instagram.<edge>.fna.fbcdn.net` behind a signed URL that needs no
cookie and no auth header. A browser `User-Agent` plus
`Referer: https://www.instagram.com/` is enough, and the signature expires, so
download soon after collecting. `curl_cffi` with `impersonate="chrome"` is the
comfortable path; plain `urllib` also works.

## The script

`<plugin-root>/skills/grabber-development/scripts/instagram_grab.py`
implements all of the above: session reuse, the login and consent parking, the
capture-and-replay pagination, largest-candidate selection, carousel expansion,
concurrent resumable downloads and a manifest. Run it with `--dry-run` first to
see the plan without spending bandwidth.
