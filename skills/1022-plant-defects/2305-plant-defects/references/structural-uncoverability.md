# Structural Uncoverability

Code that no test binary compiles is not uncovered. It is absent from the program the tools analyzed, which is why nothing reports it.

## Four failure classes

| Class                     | Shape                                                                                    | How it is found                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| False negative            | A defect one instrument cannot see                                                       | Plant it and watch the instrument stay green; name a second one |
| False positive            | Nothing was broken and a required check said something was                               | The check fails on an unmodified tree                           |
| Structural uncoverability | Code that no test binary compiles, so it is not in the analyzed program                  | Plant a defect in it and watch the whole suite pass             |
| Unvisited branch          | It compiles, an instrument could reach it, and no arm was ever written to steer it there | Plant a defect in it and watch the whole suite pass             |

The first is closed by adding an instrument. The second is closed by fixing the check. The third is closed by changing what the test build contains, and no test written against the build as it stands will do it. The fourth **is** closed by a test, but a specific one: a new arm supplying an input that steers into the branch. More of the tests already there will not find it, and that is the whole of the difference between the last two.

Note that the third and fourth are found the same way and are not the same thing. Distinguishing them takes one extra step: check whether the code is in the binary at all.

## The measured case

A file watcher was written as two alternative types selected at compile time:

```zig
const Watcher = if (shader.live) struct { ... } else struct { ... };
// where: shader.live = builtin.mode == .Debug and !builtin.is_test
```

A test binary is a debug build with the test flag set, so it takes the stub. The real `poll` was not merely untested: it was **not compiled**, and no test written in that suite could have reached it however it was written.

The plant was applied to `poll` as it stood, before anything moved. The unit suite reported **297 of 297** and the smoke harness reported `ok`, with all five of its hot-reload arms running and both rejection diagnostics printed. Nothing in the repository caught the defect the issue had been filed about, so the gap was one instrument wider than the issue claimed.

Two lessons, both transferable:

- **A coverage tool cannot report this.** The code is not 0% covered; it is not present. Reading a coverage report and finding nothing alarming is consistent with a whole subsystem being absent.
- **An acceptance criterion that names the instrument it expects to fail is asserting something, and it has to be run rather than read.** This criterion named a hand-run harness as the one instrument that would catch the defect. Run, that harness caught nothing.

## Causes, by mechanism

| Mechanism                          | Spelling                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compile-time branch on a test flag | `if (comptime is_test) Stub else Real`                                |
| Build tags                         | `//go:build production`, with the test command never passing that tag |
| Conditional compilation            | `#[cfg(not(test))]`, `#ifdef NDEBUG`, `#if DEBUG`                     |
| Feature flags                      | A default feature set that excludes the module under test             |
| Build-mode branches                | Code behind a debug-only or release-only path                         |
| Dependency injection at build time | A fake wired in for every test target, with no arm using the real one |

The pattern to watch for is any predicate that mentions the test configuration, or a tag the test command does not pass. A stub selected for tests is a reasonable design; a stub selected for tests with no other arm reaching the real implementation is this failure.

Note the Go row's shape, because the obvious spelling of it is wrong: `go test` does not define a `test` build tag, so a file guarded by `//go:build !test` is compiled by the test build like any other. What produces the failure is a tag the test command never passes, so name the tag your own build uses rather than assuming a conventional one exists.

**Two mechanisms that look like this class and are not.** Both are worth naming, because miscategorizing them sends you to the wrong remedy:

- **A type-check-only branch**, such as Python's `if TYPE_CHECKING:`, is false at runtime by design and normally guards imports and annotations rather than an implementation. A static type checker does analyze it, so it is covered by a different instrument rather than absent from the analyzed program.
- **Linker dead-code elimination** happens after compilation, so a planted type error in a declaration the linker later drops is still analyzed and still fails the build. It can remove the code from the artifact, which matters for the artifact check below, but it does not make the code uncoverable by a compile-time plant.

## Lazy and per-declaration analysis

Some toolchains do not type-check what nothing references. A public function nothing calls can carry a type error and the build still succeeds.

Measured rather than reasoned about: a type error planted in one accessor built clean, and the same error in a function the suite calls failed the build. The same plant on a private method built clean even with a reflection-style sweep in place, because the sweep does not reach private declarations.

**The build cache cannot answer this question for you**, because a manifest lists the files the compiler read rather than the declarations it checked. The check that does answer it is a planted type error in the specific declaration you care about, which still produces a binary if nothing references it.

The closing move is a sweep that references every public declaration from a test, so the analysis reaches them. The control on the sweep is to plant a type error in a declaration that was uncalled **before** the sweep existed, and confirm the build now fails where it previously built clean. Note the ordering, because it is what makes the control mean anything: once the sweep is in place no declaration is uncalled any more, so "plant it in something nothing calls" describes a set that the sweep just emptied. Pick the declaration first, from the pre-sweep tree, and keep its name in the plant table.

## The optimize-mode matrix

Run the suite in the configuration that ships, not only in the one that is convenient.

- Assertions may be compiled out in release, so a suite that passes in debug is silent about the artifact users receive.
- Optimization can remove the very branch a plant targets.
- A cheap hint that the modes really differ: search each test binary for a panic message the compiler only emits in checked modes, and see whether it is present in some and absent in others. Treat it as a hint and not as a control, for the reason given below about artifact strings: optimization, dead-code elimination, stripping and string pooling each change string retention on their own, so the search can differ when the modes do not and match when they do. The control that does settle it is a planted assertion failure built in each mode, where the build's own result answers rather than a search over its output.

Then pin the configuration and give the pin a control of its own. On the source project a build option carries the mode the build system asked for and a compile-time block fails the build if the artifact was produced at another. Planted, by swapping the mode at the call site, it fails and names both modes. Without it, a refactor that drops the pin leaves a green job testing the same mode twice.

## The unvisited branch

The fourth class, and the hardest to notice.

The code compiles in a plain build, an instrument that could reach it exists, and no arm was ever written to steer it there. What makes it hard to see is that **every counter it moved was read by something, so nothing looked absent.** There is no stub in the source and no configuration predicate to grep for. The branch is simply never taken by any input the suite supplies.

**Coverage tooling can see this one, and that is the difference from the third class.** Which mode you need depends on the shape of the branch, and the distinction is worth keeping straight rather than dismissing line coverage wholesale:

- **Where the untaken arm has body lines of its own**, line coverage does report them as uncovered, and that is enough.
- **Where it has no lines to report**, line coverage shows nothing missing: a condition that is never false in an `if` with no `else`, a short-circuited operand, a ternary, a single-line guard, a `switch` arm sharing a line with its neighbour. The decision line executes, so it counts as covered whichever way it went.

Branch or condition coverage reports a branch with zero executions in both shapes and names it directly, which makes it the cheapest instrument for this class and a reason to turn it on rather than settling for line percentages. Contrast structural uncoverability, where no coverage mode helps because the code is not in the analyzed program at all.

Finding these is a matter of enumerating the arms an instrument has rather than trusting that the instrument exists. Ask, for each check: which inputs does it actually run on, and which branch does each one take?

A related case worth recording separately: a defensive arm that an earlier guard refuses, so it cannot fire at all. That one is unreachable rather than unvisited, and it is worth a line in the plant table saying so.

## Finding all four

A procedure, cheapest first:

1. **Grep for configuration predicates that mention the test flag**, the test feature, or a debug-only mode. Each hit is a candidate for structural uncoverability.
1. **Plant an error the analyzer must reject** in each declaration you believe is covered, one at a time, and confirm something fails. A type error is the sharpest form and assumes a compile or type-check step over declarations. Where there is none, as in an untyped dynamic language, substitute whatever does analyse **at declaration granularity**: a type checker run in strict mode, an import-time failure, or a lint rule that resolves names. A deliberate syntax error is not a substitute, which is worth saying because it looks like one: a parser rejects the whole module whether or not the declaration is referenced, so it fails in every case and discriminates nothing. It tests that the file is parsed, which is a different and much weaker claim. A clean result means nothing is analysing that declaration, and if no analyser reaches it at all then this step cannot discriminate and step 3 has to carry the work.
1. **Plant a behavioural defect** in each declaration whose build did fail, and confirm a named test fails. A clean run over a compiled declaration has three readings, not two: an unvisited branch, a missing arm, or a false negative where the instrument you used cannot observe this defect at all. Consult the blindness matrix before assigning a class, since the third reading calls for a different instrument rather than a new arm. See `./references/instrument-blindness.md`.
1. **Check the artifact, as supporting evidence only.** Searching the test binary for a string unique to the code in question is cheap and suggestive, and it is not a discriminator on its own: optimization, dead-code elimination, symbol stripping, and string pooling can each drop or retain a literal independently of whether the branch was compiled and reachable. Let step 2's compile-time plant decide the class, and use the string search to corroborate it.
1. **Record the class** in the plant table, because the remedy differs by class and a row that only says "not caught" invites the wrong fix.

## The remedy

For structural uncoverability, make the code reachable from a test build. Usually this means extracting the part that has no platform dependency, so the bookkeeping becomes a pure function the suite can call while the compile-time selection keeps only the part that genuinely cannot run under test. On the source project, extracting a watcher's bookkeeping turned a plant that nothing caught into a plant that fails three named tests.

For an unvisited branch, add the arm, and state which input steers it there.

For either, where extraction is not worth it, name the obligation and give it a home rather than leaving it as prose. A manual check with an owner is a different thing from a gap nobody has written down.
