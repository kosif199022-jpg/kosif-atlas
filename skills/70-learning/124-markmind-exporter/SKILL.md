# MarkMind Exporter

Render a mindmap JSON outline into Obsidian MarkMind Rich format. This skill takes a pre-built mindmap JSON structure (produced by `generate-mindmap` or any other source) and converts it into a `.md` file the user can drop directly into their Obsidian vault and open with the MarkMind plugin.

## Input

A JSON file with the standard mindmap outline format:

```json
{
  "root": "🎯 Central Theme",
  "branches": [
    {
      "text": "🔴 Branch One",
      "color": "#ff6b6b",
      "children": [
        {
          "text": "⚙️ Sub-concept A",
          "children": [
            { "text": "Detail 1" },
            { "text": "Detail 2" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check for input

If no mindmap JSON is available (no file path, no prior `generate-mindmap` output, no inline JSON in the conversation), invoke the `learning:generate-mindmap` skill first to brainstorm and produce the JSON outline from the user's topic or content. Then continue with Step 1.

### Step 1: Locate the mindmap JSON

Find the mindmap outline JSON -- either a file path provided by the user, output from a prior `generate-mindmap` invocation, or inline JSON.

### Step 2: Run the renderer

Pipe the JSON outline to `scripts/generate_markmind.py`:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | python scripts/generate_markmind.py --output /path/to/output.md --max-depth 4
{...mindmap JSON...}
EOF
```

Or from a file:

```bash
python scripts/generate_markmind.py --input outline.json --output /path/to/output.md --max-depth 4
```

The script automatically:
- Generates unique node IDs
- Splits branches left/right of root
- Calculates x/y coordinates with proper spacing (recursive, supports any depth)
- Truncates nodes beyond `--max-depth` (default: 4)
- Creates 8 empty free nodes
- Wraps everything in valid MarkMind Rich format

### Step 3: Deliver

Present the generated `.md` file to the user. Mention it's ready to drop into Obsidian.

## Reference

Read `references/markmind-rich-spec.md` for the full MarkMind Rich JSON schema if needed.

## Checklist Before Delivery

- All `pid` references point to existing `id` values
- Root has `isRoot: true`, `main: true`, layout object
- No `pid` on root node
- Each L2 branch has a unique stroke color
- All descendants inherit their L2 ancestor's stroke
- Coordinates don't overlap (V_SPACING respected)
- JSON is valid (no trailing commas, balanced brackets)
- 8 empty free nodes present
- No node exceeds the configured max depth
