# plan-test — a machine-wide concurrency budget for test runs.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Several Claude sessions work on this machine at once, in different repos,
#   and none of them can see what the others are running. Each `flutter test`
#   costs roughly a gigabyte of baseline plus its test isolates; three at once
#   on a 16 GB machine exhausts memory, and macOS answers that with a watchdog
#   reboot. Worse, the swapfile volume shares an APFS container with the
#   worktrees, so a disk full of build/ output caps how far swap can grow —
#   the disk problem and the memory problem are one problem.
#
#   This is the semaphore that stops over-subscription: a fixed number of
#   slots, taken before a run and released after. No central authority and no
#   message passing — a peer that never answers would just be a run that
#   proceeds anyway, which is the failure this exists to prevent.
#
# WHY THE SLOT COUNT AND NOT `-j`
#   Capping concurrent INVOCATIONS is arithmetic: N runs cost N times one run.
#   Capping each run's `--concurrency` is a different claim, and the one repo it
#   was measured on showed no memory benefit. So this does NOT touch `-j` by default.
#   `PLAN_TEST_J` is there for whoever measures it; until someone does, the
#   flag would be a number nobody can defend.
#
# WHY IT REFUSES INSTEAD OF WAITING FOREVER
#   The Bash tool caps a call at 600s. Waiting out a five-minute suite and then
#   running a five-minute suite exceeds that, and the caller learns nothing from
#   a timeout. So the wait is bounded and the refusal names who is holding what,
#   for how long — a caller that knows the holder can narrow its scope or go do
#   something else. Silence would be the same failure in a quieter costume.
#
# Usage:
#   plan-test test/features/foo/      # scoped run (flutter or dart, auto-detected)
#   plan-test --full                  # the whole suite, deliberately
#   plan-test --exec <cmd...>         # hold a slot around an arbitrary command
#   plan-test --slots <n> --exec <cmd...>   # hold n slots (all or none)
#   plan-test --status                # who is holding what
#   plan-test --help
#
# WHY `--exec` EXISTS
#   A budget with holes is not a budget. `plan-mutation` runs MANY suites
#   without ever typing `flutter test` at the top level, so the hook cannot see
#   it and it would spend memory off the books. Its launcher routes through here
#   instead. `--exec` holds its slots for the whole operation, not per inner run:
#   the inner loop must not thrash the semaphore. It holds one slot per suite
#   that runs AT ONCE — `--slots n` for `plan-mutation --workers n` — taken all
#   together or not at all, since a caller sitting on part of its share starves
#   everyone and still cannot start.
#
# Env:
#   PLAN_TEST_SLOTS    slot count      (default: max(1, (RAM_GB - 8) / 4))
#   PLAN_TEST_WAIT     seconds to wait (default: 120)
#   PLAN_TEST_J        pin --concurrency (default: unset — leave the tool's own)
#   PLAN_TEST_DIR      slot directory  (default: $HOME/.claude/.flutter-toolkit/slots)
