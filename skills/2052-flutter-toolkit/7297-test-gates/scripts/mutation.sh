# mutation.sh — mutation-test the files this cycle actually changed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Line coverage is not test strength: a suite that calls every line and
#   asserts nothing scores 100%. Mutation testing is the check that tells them
#   apart — change the source, re-run the tests, and a mutation nothing turns
#   red on is a hole.
#
# WHY IT IS SCOPED TO THE DIFF
#   Runtime is mutants × (one analyze + one test run), and there is no way
#   around that — each mutant needs its own. Whole-repo is an overnight job, not
#   a gate. The files this cycle touched are both the affordable scope and the
#   one that matters.
#
# THE ENGINE
#   `dart_mutants` (kai-packages), AST-based via package:analyzer. It replaced a
#   regex engine that was blind to exactly the constructs a Flutter `build()` is
#   made of — measured, one construct per file: a ternary, a switch expression
#   and `??` each produced ZERO mutants under the old tool, while `if`,
#   collection-`if`, `&&` and `<=` produced some. A widget file's whole
#   conditional logic could therefore go unmeasured while the score looked fine.
#
#   Two properties of the AST engine matter here and are verified, not assumed:
#   every mutant is compile-checked before it is scored (a mutant that does not
#   compile exits non-zero, which the old engine counted as "detected" — a
#   silently INFLATED score), and a mutant that hangs is killed and scored
#   `timedOut` rather than waited on forever. Neither counts toward total.
#
# JS / TS FILES
#   Changed `.js .jsx .ts .tsx .mjs .cjs .mts .cts` files go to StrykerJS, run in
#   the nearest directory holding a `package.json`, which must have
#   `@stryker-mutator/core` installed. From the diff, a file counts when it sits
#   under that package's `src/` or `lib/` and is not a `.d.ts`, a `*.test.*` /
#   `*.spec.*` or under `__tests__/` — Stryker's own default `mutate`. Stryker
#   runs the tests its config names, so the `--` test command is for Dart files
#   only. Its report is graded by the same per-file table and threshold:
#   Killed and Timeout are detected, Survived and NoCoverage are survivors,
#   CompileError and RuntimeError are invalid. Timeout counts as detected, as
#   in Stryker's own score, because its budget is derived from the measured time
#   of the tests covering each mutant, so a timeout is a hang the tests caught —
#   measured on a mutex, 10 of 18 mutants deadlock, and no --timeout answers them.
#   `--workers n` is Stryker's `--concurrency`; `--timeout`, when given, its
#   `--timeoutMS`; the other engine flags are Dart-only.
#
# USAGE
#   plan-mutation [--min <pct>] [--timeout <s>] [--baseline-timeout <s>]
#                 [--baseline-factor <n>] [--select-by-coverage]
#                 [--workers <n>] [--max-minutes <n>] [--history <file>]
#                 [--files a.dart b.ts …] [-- <test-command…>]
#
#   --timeout is the FLOOR on a mutant's budget; the engine raises it to
#   --baseline-factor × the measured baseline, and the report prints what it
#   actually used. --baseline-timeout bounds the cold baseline itself (default
#   10× --timeout). --select-by-coverage runs each mutant only against the test
#   files that reach it, gives each test selection its own baseline-derived
#   budget, and scores a mutant no test reaches as undetected. A coverage run
#   that fails is run once more, and a selection that still cannot be made
#   stops the run (`selection-unavailable`) instead of sending every mutant
#   through the full suite.
#
#   --workers n (default 1) runs n mutants at once, each in a symlinked copy of
#   the package, and holds n plan-test slots for the whole run — every worker is
#   its own test process, and memory, not cores, is the limit. `flutter test`
#   already uses several cores, so 2 workers measured 17% faster, not 2×.
#   --history appends the run's whole report as one JSON line to <file>
#   (~1 MB per few thousand mutants).
#
# HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE, AND CAPPING IT
#   The engine prints two numbers. After the baseline, the plan says what the
#   run costs at one baseline per mutant across the workers — an upper bound,
#   since a mutant the gate rejects runs no test and a selected one runs a
#   fraction of the suite. Then every `[k/N]` line carries a measured `left`,
#   from the pace this run is actually holding.
#
#   --max-minutes n ends a run that will not fit: refused before the first
#   mutant when the plan's floor alone is over it, otherwise stopped between
#   mutants as soon as the measured pace says so, with the tree restored and
#   NOTHING scored (`ABORTED (over-budget)`, exit 1 — not a low score).
#   There is no dry run to estimate against first: both numbers need the
#   baseline, which is the run's own first step, so a separate counting pass
#   would run the whole suite again to learn what this learns on the way past.
#
#   Pass a SCOPED test command — `flutter test test/features/trash`, not a bare
#   `flutter test`. The scope is what makes this affordable.
#
#   ⚠️ The test command runs in the CALLER's working directory. Run this from the
#   repo root. Measured the hard way: invoked from elsewhere it completes, prints
#   a full score, and has tested nothing — the least visible failure there is.
#
# WHILE IT RUNS, THE SOURCE ON DISK IS MUTATED
#   A live mutant compiles and reads as authored code, so anyone else on this
#   worktree — a reviewer, another session, an editor — can read it as the
#   author's. `.mutation-in-progress` at the repo root is the probe: it names the
#   pid, the sha, and the files. Read those paths with `git show <sha>:<path>`
#   while it exists. Exit 3 means the tree was NOT restored.
#
# RUNNING IT IN THE BACKGROUND
#   A run outlives any one Bash call. Start it with the Bash tool's
#   `run_in_background: true`, never `&`, `nohup`, `disown` or `setsid`: only
#   the former is tracked — listed in the session's background tasks, and the
#   session is woken when it exits. Then end the turn; nothing needs waiting
#   on. Not `Monitor`, `tail -f` or a blocking wait either: each look costs a
#   turn or holds the conversation — measured, a sub-agent spent ~200 tool
#   calls and 8 live `tail -f` on one 60-minute run.
#
# STOPPING AND RESUMING
#   `plan-mutation --stop [<pid>]` stops a run: the engine restores the tree and
#   keeps every mutant that finished, and the run prints STOPPED and exits 1,
#   scoring nothing. --stop returns once the run has exited (0), or 3 when it
#   was killed before it restored the tree. Run the same command again and
#   only the unfinished mutants run — Dart through dart_mutants' journal, JS/TS
#   through Stryker's incremental file, both kept under
#   $TMPDIR and reused only while the code and tests are unchanged. A finished
#   run started again reuses every result, timeouts excepted. There is no
#   pause: a frozen run's budgets keep counting, and the tree stays mutated.

# --- the engine has to be here before anything else happens -----------------
# Switching from the regex engine to the AST one changed an UNDECLARED
# prerequisite: `mutation_test` was `dart pub global activate`d, `dart_mutants`
# is a dev_dependency of the project. Without this check the first sign is
# `Could not find package dart_mutants` buried under a run that has already
# printed a file count and a threshold, which reads like the tool worked and
# found nothing.
# THE ENGINE'S RESOLVED VERSION, NOT ITS DECLARATION.
#
# `pubspec.yaml` says what was asked for; `pubspec.lock` says what pub actually
# resolved. Reading the lock separates three states a yaml grep collapses into
# one, and the third is the one that bites silently:
#   - no yaml entry          → never declared
#   - yaml but no lock entry → declared, `pub get` never run
#   - lock entry below the floor → an engine that runs, scores and reports
#                              normally while measuring or costing the wrong
#                              thing; see the two cases the gate distinguishes
#
# Not `dart run dart_mutants --version`, which is what this comment used to
# propose: that flag does not exist (measured — the engine answers "Could not
# find an option named --version" and exits 64). The lockfile is also free,
# where spawning dart costs a few hundred ms on every run.
#
# The floor is 0.2.9 because this script reads the report from `--output` and
# streams the engine's progress lines, both new there. Below 0.2.3 there is a
# second reason, and it is about what a timeout costs on a machine somebody is
# also working on. `flutter test` is three processes; through 0.2.2
# the timeout SIGKILLed only the direct child, and POSIX reparents the orphaned
# `flutter_tester` to init rather than killing it, so it went on running the
# mutant with nothing left to reap it — measured by the engine at 1.86 GB on
# the kill and 2.25 GB three seconds later, roughly 130 MB/s indefinitely, per
# timed-out mutant, SURVIVING the run that created it. Two runs exhausted a
# workstation. `trap cleanup` below cannot help: the escaped process is no
# longer a descendant of anything this script can see. And the remedy this gate
# prints for a timeout is a LARGER --timeout, which multiplies the exposure,
# because a mutant allocates for the whole window.
#
# 0.3.1 because through 0.3.0 every test run left what `flutter test` does not
# clean up — a `flutter_tools.*` directory, ~270 MB — in the system temp dir,
# once per mutant. Measured on one host: 111 of them filled the disk before the
# run could write its report, so the run failed after all its work was done.
#
# 0.5.0 because below it there is no journal: a run that is stopped, killed or
# loses its cloud VM starts every mutant over, and a run longer than the VM
# lives never finishes.

# `total` already excludes invalid and timedOut, so the percentage is over
# mutants that actually ran. Both counts are still REPORTED, because a file whose
# candidates were mostly rejected has a tiny effective sample and its score is
# arithmetic rather than evidence — the same emptiness as a low mutant count.
#

# either. Without the strip, an absolute path makes every row fail to match the

# The per-mutant budget is derived — the larger of --timeout and a multiple of a
# measured baseline — so the flag value is only a floor. `mutantTimeoutSeconds`

plan-mutation: ${to_total} mutant(s) TIMED OUT — those candidates were never

score, and the rows above under-report how much of each file was actually asked.
$( [ -n "$timed" ] && printf '\nTimed-out mutants:\n%s' "$timed" )

A timeout has two causes and this tool cannot tell them apart:
  · the budget is too tight — ${budget_line} must cover a FULL run of your test
    command, so a command that already takes most of that leaves no headroom;
  · the mutant genuinely hangs the code, which is a real finding.

Re-run those files with a larger --timeout. If the timeouts disappear it was the
budget; if one persists, that mutant is hanging and worth reading.

Raising --timeout raises PEAK MEMORY too — a mutant that allocates inside its
loop allocates for the whole window — so widen it on the files that timed out,
not on the whole diff.

  A LOW-SIGNAL row was NOT measured, whatever percentage it shows — a 100% over
  two mutants is arithmetic, not evidence, and it blocks for that reason rather
  than for its score. Two ways in, with different remedies:
    · timeouts left the verdict undetermined → re-run those files with a larger
      --timeout; if it resolves, the score was never the problem
    · the mutant pool is genuinely thin → the file cannot be graded this way.
      Say so in the hand-back, with what you checked instead.

suite that asserts nothing, and a test command that ran no tests at all. Confirm
the command actually executes tests over these files before treating the list

If a survivor is genuinely equivalent (the mutant cannot change behaviour), say
so at the site — equivalent mutants are unkillable by definition, which is why
the threshold is not 100%, and a survivor with no written reason is
indistinguishable from a hole.
