# Comment Slop

A comment earns its place only if it states a fact that is:

1. **True at this layer** — about the code it sits on, not a caller's or a callee's behavior.
2. **Not already visible** in the code in front of the reader.
3. **Not stated better nearby** — in the signature, in the module docstring, in a test name, or on the very next line.

Every slop comment fails one of those three clauses. That is the whole diagnosis. The rest of this skill is how to apply it, and — just as important — how to recognize the comments that pass, so a cleanup pass does not delete the reasoning that was worth keeping.

This is the operational form of the familiar rule: **comment the why, not the what or the how.** Code with descriptive names already tells the reader what it does, and the body is the how — a comment restating either fails clause 2. What the code cannot say is the why: context from outside the file, the business rule being implemented, the design decision that looks wrong until explained (the keep table below). But the folk rule is a compass, not a verdict — a why-shaped sentence still fails when it describes another layer or restates a convention with a documented home (see *Abstracting is not the fix either*). The three clauses decide, and the burden of proof sits on the comment: the default verdict is delete, and a comment that cannot show a pass does not get one.

Apply the delete default to ordinary prose after checking its audience and consumers. Tool directives, license notices, executable examples, runtime help, and generated API documentation have functions beyond explaining nearby code; preserve those functions. A comment's style does not establish whether AI wrote it.

Slop is not a length problem. It is a content-selection problem, which is why shortening or generalizing comments makes it worse rather than better (see *Trimming is not the fix* and *Abstracting is not the fix either*).

## When to Use

- A reviewer says a comment is useless, confusing, or "seems like an AI comment"
- Cleaning up comments and docstrings on a branch or PR before sending it for review
- A comment uses a term the reader has to go look up, or describes machinery that is not in the file
- Auditing agent-written or generated code for filler prose

## Failure modes

Each mode below is one clause of the test failing. The examples are real; the reviewer reactions are quotes from an actual review.

### 1. Wrong layer

The comment describes another module's semantics, written from the author's whole-call-graph vantage rather than the reader's.

```python
def retention_config_to_proto(user_parameters: list[UserParameter]) -> RetentionConfig:
    """Project a contract's retention user parameter into the RetentionConfig proto.

    No retention parameter means the contract has no override and uses the
    package defaults entirely.
    """
```

> *"the comment mentions a package and I don't see a package here"*

User parameters go in, a proto comes out. No package crosses this boundary. "Uses the package defaults" is the *resolver's* behavior, one layer up — true of the system, not of this function.

**Fix**: say what an empty result means *at this layer* ("the contract stores no override") and stop. Whoever consumes the empty proto decides what to do about it.

**Fix, when the wrong-layer sentence justified a gate**: replace the collaborator's behavior with the precondition itself. "An organization-level override sets the days for every category" (the setting happens two functions away) becomes "The contract must have no organization-level override." The reason moves out; the condition the body checks stays.

**The boundary**: describing how the function's **own return is derived** stays in scope even when a private helper does the arithmetic — that is still this function's input-to-output contract. Out of scope is what happens *elsewhere in the system*.

**Heuristic**: name every noun in the comment. If a noun never appears in the parameters, the return type, the body, or the things the body calls, the comment is describing somewhere else.

**Second heuristic — the sibling paste-test**: would the comment be just as true pasted onto the neighboring declarations in the same file? A comment equally true on every sibling documents the architecture, not this code. If the fact is worth writing down, its home is the module docstring or the convention doc — not one method among the many it applies to.

### 2. Redundant with the line next to it

```python
# The endpoint proto replaces the dataclass request. It also adds `@service_method`.
# TODO: add @service_method and switch to the endpoint proto.
```

> *"Seems like a useless AI comment?"*

The TODO already carries the fact, in the imperative, in the form someone can act on. The sentence above it is the same fact restated as description.

**Fix**: delete the prose, keep the TODO. When two adjacent comments say one thing, keep the one that is actionable.

### 3. Undefined term at the point of use

```python
# The caller resolves the current (unsealed) contract
```

> *"What does 'unsealed' mean?"*

"Sealed" was defined in the module docstring 200 lines above, and this comment uses the *negation* of that term, so the reader has to find the definition and then invert it.

The instinct is to define the term inline. Check first whether the term is needed at all. Here it was not: the "current contract" query already selects on the absence of a usage invoice, which *is* the definition of unsealed. The comment restated a filter the query itself expresses.

**Fix**: deleted, not defined.

**Rule**: before defining a confusing term, look at whether the code already encodes the concept. A term that needs a definition to earn its place usually did not earn its place.

### 4. Restates the signature

```python
def validate_retention_overrides(overrides: list[RetentionOverride]) -> None:
    """Validate sparse numeric contract retention overrides."""
```

The name says validate. The parameter says retention overrides. `-> None` says it either raises or does nothing. "Sparse" and "numeric" are properties of the type. Zero information.

**Fix**: a docstring on a function this well-named earns its place only by saying what the validation *rejects*, what it raises, or that it is the sole enforcement point for an invariant. If none of that is true, delete it.

### 5. Forward references, history, and planning artifacts

Comments about work that does not exist yet ("this arrives when a sibling service needs to write retention"), phase and step labels (P1, M1, "Step 1b"), ticket IDs, links to internal planning documents.

The reader cannot verify any of it from the repository, and it goes stale the moment plans change. Commit messages and the ticket are the durable homes for intent; in code it reads as the author narrating their own roadmap.

Historical claims are the backward mirror: "that tier never dropped" is about past config, and nothing in the code can confirm it. State the condition the body checks instead (`downsampled_days == THIRTEEN_MONTHS`).

**Fix**: delete. If the code genuinely depends on future work, that dependency belongs in a TODO that names the concrete thing to do here.

### 6. Prose that contradicts the code

```python
# A write here never reaches the live successor and it rewrites the sealed record.
raise ContractSealedError(...)
```

Stated as present-tense fact, but the code raises precisely to prevent it. The reader has to work out that the sentence describes the world where the guard is absent.

**Fix**: use the conditional. "A write here *would not* reach the live successor and *would* rewrite the sealed record." One word turns a contradiction into the reason the guard exists.

### 7. Narrating the code

```python
# Increment the retry count by 1
retries += 1
```

The line already says it. Reserve the comment for the fact the line cannot carry — why three retries, which upstream API returns spurious 500s.

## What to keep

A comment is load-bearing if deleting it leaves a reader with a question the code cannot answer. Keep these, and keep them even when they are wordy:

| Keep when the comment... | Test |
|---|---|
| explains **why** this approach and not the obvious one | Would a competent reader "simplify" the code away if the comment were gone? |
| names a race, a lock's purpose, or an ordering constraint | Does it say what breaks without the ordering? |
| states an invariant and what enforces it | Is the invariant impossible to see from one function? |
| carries context from an external system, spec, or business rule | Is that fact unavailable anywhere else in the repo? |
| records a deliberate trade-off | Does it name the cost that was accepted? |
| justifies a guard that looks removable | Would deleting the guard still pass the tests? |

Two that pass:

```python
# isdigit() alone also accepts digits int() cannot parse, such as superscripts,
# and this guard must return False rather than raise
```

```python
# Read the raw column: loading the invoice itself would cost a query on every
# sealed contract
```

Both state a fact that is invisible in the code and true at this layer. Neither is short.

**The default is delete.** The burden of proof sits on the comment: a keep must show its pass — name the row of this table it satisfies and the fact the code cannot state. "It might help someone" is not a pass; every slop comment might help someone. Doubt protects exactly one shape of comment: one that asserts a why — a rationale, an ordering constraint, a trade-off — that you cannot cheaply verify from the code in front of you. Deleting a real rationale costs the next person the bug it was preventing, which is worse than any bland comment; a comment of that shape survives being torn over. A restatement of the visible never does.

## What a docstring must state

The audit decides what a docstring may *not* say. For the ones that stay — and any you write — four gaps recur once the slop is gone, each a fact the signature genuinely cannot carry (these are mode 4's pass conditions, stated generatively):

- **Tuple returns**: which position is which, and what each value means. A bare `tuple[bool, bool]` explains nothing; "The first value is for the standard tier. The second value is for the downsampled tier. A value is true when the grandfathering includes that tier."
- **Boolean polarity**, especially when the body computes by negation (`not _tier_overridden(...)`) — the reader sees the negation and cannot tell which polarity means what.
- **Silent defaults and fallbacks**: an `else 0`, a `fallback=` argument, an early return of an empty set. Each undocumented branch gets its own sentence.
- **One word for one concept across siblings**: a trio of related functions all say *includes*; a pair of tuple-returners both say *first value / second value*. A synonym forces the reader to check whether it names the same thing (mode 3's cost, in reverse).

## The what belongs in the code

When you are writing or changing code — not just auditing its comments — the order is: make the code state the *what* (descriptive names, extracted variables, named constants), then comment only the *why* that survives. A name cannot drift from the code the way a comment can, and nobody has to decide later whether it earned its place.

```python
# The comment carries what a name could:
n = 3  # maximum retry attempts

# The name carries it, and no comment is needed:
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
```

In an audit the same rule runs backward. A *what*-comment that resists deletion — removing it really would leave the reader lost — is not a keep; it is evidence the code under it is unclear. A vague name, a magic value, an expression doing more than its parts admit. Fix the code — rename, extract, name the constant — then delete the comment.

A docstring paraphrase of a constant is the same failure one level up: "the categories whose default dropped to thirty days" describes the value instead of naming it. Name `NEW_30_DAY_RETENTION_CATEGORIES`, the thing the body filters on — a named constant is checkable in place; a paraphrase is trusted.

Two boundaries:

- **A rename is a code change.** Behavior-neutral, but it breaks the docs-only diff of workflow step 6. Commit it separately from the comment cleanup.
- **Only the what moves into names.** No identifier is descriptive enough to carry a trade-off, a race, or an external requirement — the keep table is out of renaming's reach. "The code documents itself" never licenses deleting a why.

## Trimming is not the fix

Mechanically shortening comments makes slop *worse*.

A style pass — ASD-STE100 simplified English, "short sentences, one idea each, active voice", a general instruction to be concise — constrains sentence *structure*. It cannot do content *selection*. Applied to a comment that carried real reasoning, it strips the clause holding the *why* and leaves a bland declarative that reads exactly like AI filler.

A real case:

```python
# Before (never drew a review comment):
# A sibling service may only reach this package through its `__init__`, so this
# is the write's supported entry point.

# After a trimming pass (immediately flagged as AI slop):
# Callers outside the services tree use this method.
```

The specificity (which callers, through what) and the reason (the package boundary) both vanished. The trimmed version is shorter, grammatically simpler, and worthless.

The judgment a mechanical pass cannot make: **a comment that survives trimming with only obvious statements left should be deleted, not shortened.** Decide keep-or-delete first. Only then edit wording — to fix the layer, the mood, an undefined term, or to apply the style rules below.

## Abstracting is not the fix either

Trimming has a sibling failure: rewriting a comment so that its concrete anchors — who acts, through what mechanism, on what — become a citation of the general convention. A why-shaped fact survives, so the result passes a casual "does it explain why?" check. It still fails the test: a convention with a documented home (the architecture doc, a CLAUDE.md rule, the module docstring) fails clause 3 wherever it is restated, and the anchors were the part a reviewer could check.

The same site as the trimming example, one review round later. The flagged trimmed version was repaired — by abstracting:

```python
# The original (anchored: who, through what, for what):
# A sibling service may only reach this package through its `__init__`, so this
# is the write's supported entry point.

# The repair (anchors replaced by a policy citation — flagged in the next
# review round: "seems not helpful AI generated, can delete it"):
# A service package exports only its service class. This method is
# therefore the only supported entry point for the write from outside
# the package.
```

Nothing in the second version is false. But run mode 1's noun heuristic on it: "service package" and "service class" appear nowhere in the method it sits on. When the anchors went, the comment stopped being about this code — it became the project's export rule, restated on one arbitrary method among the many it applies to (the sibling paste-test in mode 1).

Two rules fall out of this case:

- **Resemblance to an example is not a verdict.** The abstracted repair superficially matches the good "Before" comment in the trimming example — package, exports, "supported entry point". Examples locate a failure mode; only the three-clause test decides. Run the test on the words in front of you, not on the example they remind you of.
- **A rewrite is a new comment.** This one failed review twice: once as a trim, once as an abstraction — each repair was checked against the previous complaint instead of the test. Re-run the three clauses (start with the noun heuristic) on every rewrite's output. Output that cannot pass becomes a delete — which is what the reviewer suggested here.

## Style for what survives (ASD-STE100)

Style is the second pass, never the first. Content selection (keep / rewrite / delete) decides *which facts* a comment states; only then does style decide *how the sentences say them*. Run the two in the other order and you get the trimming failure above.

For the comments you rewrite — and for any comment text you write yourself — apply the ASD-STE100 habits that survive contact with code:

- **Short sentences, one idea each.** A comment holding two facts is two sentences.
- **Complete sentences — no verbless noun-phrase summaries.** "Whether the grandfathering applies…" drops the verb to shorten the line; lead with one instead: "Tell whether…", "Give the days…".
- **Active voice, named actor.** "The resolver applies the defaults", not "defaults are applied" — the actor is often the load-bearing information (which layer does it: mode 1's question).
- **No double negation.** "Neither consults nor pays for" → one positive sentence per fact: "does no legacy work and gets no legacy error."
- **Present tense for what the code does; conditional for what a guard prevents** (mode 6).
- **One term, one meaning.** Reuse the exact identifier, or the term the module docstring defines; a synonym forces the reader to check whether it names the same thing (mode 3).
- **No filler openers or intensifiers.** "Note that", "simply", "it is important to" — delete the phrase, keep the sentence.

Kept comments stay untouched by default — restyling every keep is churn. Restyle a keep only when its wording breaks these rules badly enough to slow the reader (a buried actor, a 40-word sentence), and then without touching content.

The override rule: **a style edit may not delete a fact.** If a rule and a fact collide — the sentence runs long because the why-clause is long — the fact wins and the rule loses. ASD-STE100 constrains wording; the three-clause test alone decides content.

For the full docstring-rewrite convention — the deeper STE-100 subset (approved senses, no coined compounds, no inverted word order, sentence and paragraph caps) and the per-sentence body-scope test with its boundary cases — see [references/docstring-conventions.md](references/docstring-conventions.md).

## Workflow

### 1. Scope to the diff

Default to the diff, or use the files/repository scope the user explicitly requests. Load the relevant context for each candidate; a repository-wide search is an inventory, not permission to delete from search hits.

```bash
base=main                                      # the branch the PR targets
git diff "$base"...HEAD --stat                 # pick the files in scope
git diff "$base"...HEAD -U15 -- path/to/file   # wide context for judgment
```

For an inventory of what arrived, list the added comment lines — then open each site rather than acting on this list:

```bash
git diff "$base"...HEAD -U0 | grep -E '^\+\s*(#|//|/\*|\*|"""|<!--)'
```

This pattern only matches lines that *start* with a comment marker, so it under-counts: trailing comments (`x += 1  # why`) and docstring body lines do not appear in it. Treat it as a starting list — the full-diff read in step 2 is what catches the rest.

### 2. Read the code the comment sits on

Every verdict needs the function's parameters, return type, and body on screen. A comment that looks redundant in a grep line often names a constraint that is real three lines down; a comment that reads fine in isolation is often describing another module entirely — mode 1 is invisible without the signature. Never judge a comment from a search hit alone.

### 3. Verify what the comment claims

A comment asserting a fact may simply be stale: the code moved and the sentence did not. Check the claim against the code before preserving it. "It explains why" does not make it true, and a wrong comment is worse than an empty one. A false claim is a rewrite or a delete, never a keep.

The same bar applies to claims you write: a sentence like "the override changes both values" is written only after reading (or running) the test that pins it — not from memory of the code.

### Optional Jev check

For uncertain redundancy, a mixed comment/docstring, or a proposed reduction, use
[references/jev-review.md](references/jev-review.md). Supply the exact text and
source location, surrounding implementation, known consumers, and missing evidence.
Distinguish facts supplied only to verify the claim from documentation the intended
reader can still access after deletion; identify any retained document explicitly.
Jev can suggest **keep / delete / reduce / rewrite / needs_context** and judge
whether a concrete replacement preserves the useful information. The agent
identifies the redundant clauses, writes the edit, and verifies it; Jev does not
produce replacement prose or edit files.

Jev is optional. Without the general Jev helper or the selected provider key,
continue this workflow and report the consultation as skipped. An API failure
leaves its judgment incomplete; it does not turn into deletion approval. The
three-clause test and known consumer requirements still govern the edit. Explicit
published-doc, runtime-help, and tooling needs take priority over source-only
redundancy. Preserve doctest option flags, not just example text. Correct a
contradicted claim using verified code; preserving misinformation is not useful
information retention. Inspect missing evidence before editing an asserted why.

The recorded blind pilot showed no improvement over the agent alone. Use the
consultation selectively, and reject advice that conflicts with verified facts.
Passing syntax or executable-AST checks does not establish consumer preservation.

### 4. Give one verdict per comment

| Verdict | When |
|---|---|
| **keep** | Demonstrably passes all three clauses — it can name the keep-table fact the code cannot state. Leave it alone — rewording a good comment is churn that hides the real edits. |
| **reduce** | The block mixes useful facts with repetition. Identify the redundant clauses and remove only those; keep rationale, contracts, and required syntax. Re-run the three-clause test on the result. |
| **needs_context** | The claim depends on missing implementation, requirements, or consumers. Inspect that evidence before deciding; do not translate uncertainty into a delete. |
| **rewrite** | The fact is real but stated at the wrong layer, in the wrong mood, with an undefined term, or wrapped in redundant restatement. Restate it at this layer, or *reduce* it — delete the clauses that fail the test, keep the ones that pass. Then apply the [style rules](#style-for-what-survives-asd-ste100). Reduction is selection by the test, not compression. The output is a new comment: re-run the test on it, starting with the noun heuristic — trimming and abstracting are both repairs whose output stopped passing. |
| **delete** | The default. Once the wrong-layer content and the already-visible content are removed, nothing is left — and doubt is not a pass. For a *what*-comment that resists deletion because the code is unclear, fix the code, then delete (see *The what belongs in the code*). |

Expect the pass to be a net deletion. Adding a fresh explanatory paragraph where a bad one was removed is how the next reviewer arrives at the same complaint.

### 5. Check documentation and runtime consumers

Docstrings that feed generated documentation (Sphinx, godoc, rustdoc, JSDoc) have a second audience that never sees the source. One that restates the signature still fails the test for a reader of the code, but deleting it can blank an entry in the published API docs. Rewrite these into what the function returns, rejects, or raises rather than removing them.

Also preserve lint/type/formatter/compiler directives, shebangs, encoding markers,
license notices, doctests, runtime `__doc__` consumers, CLI help, and framework
metadata. A directive may be redundant only after its tool confirms that; a
semantic preference cannot establish it. For partial reductions, list the facts
that must survive and check the proposed replacement against each one.

Check syntax and the relevant docs/doctest/help/tool output after an edit. Ordinary
comments do not execute, but docstrings are runtime values and comment directives
can change tooling behavior. An unchanged executable AST alone does not prove
those consumers were preserved.

### 6. Commit the cleanup on its own

A docs-only commit diffs to nothing but comment lines and reviews in a minute. Mixed into behavior changes, the reviewer has to check every hunk for a hidden logic edit. Before committing, confirm the diff touches comment lines only — if a line of code moved, split it out.

Finally, re-read each touched hunk as someone who has not seen the rest of the branch. That is the check that catches the wrong-layer failures the author cannot see from inside their own context.
