# Horismos Protocol

Define epistemic boundaries through a recognizable whole map and progressive examination. Type: `(BoundaryUndefined, AI, DEFINE, TaskScope) → DefinedBoundary`.

## Definition

- **Horismos** (ὁρισμός) takes a task whose boundary is undefined, including one whose decision structure or sufficient depth of examination is not yet recognizable, and produces a source-grounded boundary with its residual — what is still open.
- Before asking the user what to settle or entrust, construct the relevant whole provisional map of decisions, obligations, assumptions, and dependencies. A settled goal and a user-supplied inventory are not prerequisites. Bound this whole to the current context and show what remains unknown.
- Let the user open any axis, see the concrete content and consequences needed to judge it, correct the map, and entrust at the depth they find sufficient. The map remains the object of judgment; opening an axis does not require visiting every other one.
- Keep the boundary question distinct from its settlement disposition and from the content of the decision. For ownership, the disposition assigns the named decision directly; an allocation question is a separate domain only when the source makes allocation itself the subject.
- The boundary stands in one of two ways — the user accepts it as it stands, at that depth, from the context as it then stands, or no item on the map awaits the user's disposition and it stands as shown — and in either case only where no turn of the user's is still owed — for instance an unclear reply, or contrary grounds of the AI they have not closed over; a request to see something is served by the turn that shows it — and an owed turn holds a round that serves it. Every round keeps the way to accept recognizable. Any other response that bears on the boundary continues it — standing it where it leaves nothing awaiting — or withdraws; words that do not bear on it leave it as it stood. Once it stands, the user's later words reopen it where they bear on it.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

/-! ── FLOW ──
Horismos(T) → bound(c, o, utterances), where c is the fused session context and o is how the run
stands:
  first round(c): c₀ := observed(c) [Tool] → readout(c₀) → present the whole map →
    nothing awaits the person's disposition and no turn of theirs is owed: the boundary stands —
      the turn that shows it is `converge` (an Extension), with its map, sources, and limits (an
      acceptance in the invoking context accepts nothing before a map was shown)
    otherwise: the round (`round`, a Constitution): Stop — the gate holds
  next utterance u: c' := fuse(c, u) →
    it does not bear on the boundary: the session answers it; the run stands as it was, a
      holding gate holding the context as it now stands
    a withdrawal at the person's word, or once observation settles its reading: the snapshot at
      c' and the boundary that last stood, if any; nothing is observed after a settled withdrawal;
      it sets no boundary from there; this run ends
    otherwise c'' := observed(c') [Tool] → read at c'', before your turn: the boundary stands where
      no turn of the person's is owed and their acceptance reaches it or nothing awaits them; else
      the gate holds → the next round, or the boundary shown
  no further utterance: the run as it stands — a holding gate keeps holding, a boundary that
    stands keeps standing; nothing is selected and nothing settles

/-- **Your judgment**, the record rule for dispositions: the cited turn disposes decision `d` as
    `v`, read against the context as it now stands, on the scope the turn's words reach — an
    instruction, or the taking of an arrangement shown before. The proposer is whoever first put
    the arrangement forward; the standing is what the cited turn itself did: gave it in its own
    words (`set`), or took one put forward before (`adopted`) — where you put it forward, only if
    it was visible as yours, with what decides it and your contrary grounds, where you hold any,
    before this turn. An acceptance of the boundary as it stands takes exactly the arrangements it
    covers under that condition; one it does not cover stays your proposal, and its decision stays
    open. An entrustment reaches what was shown of it: a later act that cannot be undone is
    entrusted only where its consequence was shown by kind, target, and limit, and an earlier
    authorization of the same kind, target, and limit is not asked for again. A question, a
    request to look, a deferral, or a bare mention disposes nothing. Read the form from what the

    earlier decision exists, which a recorded decision, a commit, or a peer's report relays; a
    relayed decision is cited as that fact and makes no disposition of this run. A held value
    stands only on a person's turn: in their own words (`held … set`), or by taking a value put
    forward before (`held … adopted`, under the visibility the disposition record rule names).
    Your choice inside a grant whose words reach it is `granted` — the cited turn is the one the
    arrangement governing the item stands on: the person's turn that disposed it to you, or, where
    no disposition of this run governs, the record of the earlier decision that entrusts it to
    you; the value stays yours. A decision the work rests on that the person holds — a value, a
    preference, a scope — stays open until the person's own turn gives it or a relayed decision of
    theirs fixes it; other evidence informs it without settling it. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn — a record from outside the person's turns in this context: a
    recorded decision, a commit, a peer's relay — shows that an earlier decision of the person who
    holds `d` already fixes who settles `d`, in the form and reach `a` it states, read against the
    context as it now stands as the fact that that decision exists. A recorded decision of another
    party is a fact about them, not a disposition of this item. It is not a disposition of this

    raised earlier that is still open, or that the person disposed, stays on the map while it still
    bears on the task, even where this round's discovery omits it: a person's disposition never
    drops out of the record unnoticed. You read it from the context as observation left it; a
    source it needs that observation did not return is not read here — it is named in what the

    Observe what a consequence the map shows rests on before showing it. Collect as far as the
    reachable sources go within what the map turns on; what you say you read, read whole. Where
    what returns conflicts, name what conflicts with what. A source not reached is named, by name,
    in your turn that shows the map, and so enters what the map did not look at; what still
    remains open is the person's own unknown, carried in the residual. Observation changes no
    existing state; what needs a change of state, a permission, or another's authority is named and
    handed over, not observed. -/

    question someone must own — awaits the person while neither its disposition, nor an earlier
    decision fixing who settles it, nor its content stands. One the person kept or asked proposals
    for is disposed while its value is still open; one whose disposition an earlier decision fixes
    is shown with that citation and not asked again; one whose content an earlier decision or an
    observation fixes is settled as a fact. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn accepts the boundary as it stands, in whatever words, read
    against the context as it now stands. An acceptance reaches the boundary only as it stood when
    the person accepted it: once a later correction opens an item, the earlier acceptance no longer
    reaches the boundary as it now stands, the opened item awaits the person, and what they already
    disposed stands on their own turns. An acceptance from an earlier run does not set this one,
    and one given before any map was shown accepts nothing. -/

/-- **Your reading**: the person's acceptance; `open_` until one reaches it. -/
axiom acceptance : (c : Context P) → Occ (acceptanceCoord (P := P)) c

/-- **Your judgment**: the cited turn withdraws — the person stops this run without setting the
    boundary — read against the context as it now stands. It is read at the person's word; nothing
    more is observed after a settled withdrawal. Where only what observation returns settles its
    reading, it is read once more after observation, and its record is still at the word. What the
    person already disposed stands as their words; no proposal of yours is taken by it. A withdrawal
    from an earlier run does not end this one, and a reply whose reading is unsettled withdraws
    nothing. A withdrawal after the boundary stood stops the run from there: what already relied on
    the boundary stays as done, and the record keeps the boundary that last stood beside what the
    person's words now make; a run that has withdrawn stays withdrawn. Your own reading that the run
    should end withdraws nothing. -/

/-- **Your judgment**: the latest utterance, read whole against the fused context, bears on this
    boundary — a disposition, a correction, an opening, an acceptance, a withdrawal, or anything
    that changes what the map turns on — even where it also asks for other work. An utterance that
    bears on none of it leaves the run as it stands: the session answers it, that answer stays in
    the context, a gate that holds keeps holding, and a boundary that stands keeps standing. -/
axiom Reaches : Context P → Prop

/-- **Your reading**: a turn of the person's is still owed before the boundary stands — read on the
    context as observation left it, including what this round will show. Guidance for the reading,
    not cases it must check: a reply of theirs whose reading their later words have not yet
    settled (materially different futures remain viable — the round shows the candidate readings,
    and nothing is committed from it until their words settle it); you hold contrary grounds the
    person has not closed over; an acceptance does not reach what is now at issue. A request to
    see or open something is not one: the turn that shows it serves it, seeing it adopts nothing,
    and a boundary that stands keeps standing. Where a turn is owed, the gate holds for the round
    that serves it. -/
axiom owed : Context P → Bool

/-- **Your record**: the contrary grounds you presented in a round before the person's turn — a
    disposition you doubt, a premise that may not hold — attached to the boundary where the person
    set it over them; empty when there were none. A ground you would raise first where the
    boundary would stand makes the person's turn owed instead. The person's dispositions stand
    over them: you never rewrite or veto one, and new evidence against one is shown before any
    step that depends on it and cannot be undone. -/

Λ is the fused context; every reading above is taken from it. The recursion also carries how the
run stands — the outcome so far, with the boundary that last stood — which PHASE TRANSITIONS
threads beside it.
-/

abbrev Mode (P : Type) := Context P

/-! ── PHASE TRANSITIONS ──
A step is one arm of a structural recursion over the person's utterances, carrying the context as it
stands and how the run stands. A withdrawal is read at the person's word, before any observation,
and ends the run there; where only what observation returns settles its reading, it is read once
more after observation, its record still at the word. Otherwise how the run stands is read at the
person's utterance, with what observation returned joined to it as evidence turns [Tool], before
your turn answers it; whether a turn of the person's is still owed is read there. `respond` is then
that turn: a round (`round`, a Constitution that stops for the person) where the gate holds — and
the gate that holds holds with that round in its context — or the boundary shown as it stands
(`converge`, an Extension) where it stands, its limits and dissent read with that turn; where the
utterance also asks for other work, the same turn serves that part too. A withdrawal ends the run,
and a run that has withdrawn stays withdrawn; where it also asks for other work, the session serves
that part after the run. `session` is the session's own answer to an utterance that does not bear on
the boundary, which stays in the context; the run's status is carried to it unchanged, a gate that
holds holding the context as it now stands.

/-! ── LOOP ──
A correction reopens the affected dependency region in the next readout; an unchanged source
supplies no reason to re-ask a settled decision. Neither scan exhaustion nor a visit count
constitutes the person's acceptance; where nothing awaits the person and no turn of theirs is
owed, the boundary stands with what the map did not look at shown, and stays open to their next
words. The person can accept without opening every axis; what is still open is carried as
residual. Interrupting or steering a run in progress is the host's to deliver; this block names it
only as the point where execution hands off.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
converge on `defined`: the boundary is `closeAt` of the context where no turn of the person's is
owed and their acceptance reaches it or nothing awaits their disposition, its limits and dissent
read with the turn that shows it.
  snapshot: read the current map and its cited sources; derive the residual from every item
    whose content does not stand, each with why it bears and the arrangement governing it and
    where that arrangement comes from, declared empty where nothing is open.
  trace: map each item on the map to its disposition — who put it forward and how it stood — and,
    where its content is still open, to the residual, with facts, relayed earlier decisions, and
    earlier decisions fixing who settles an item shown as cited facts, and the source and effect
    of relevant corrections. Present the whole arrangement, the dissent attached to it, and what
    the next move may and may not settle under it.
  limits: closure defines a boundary at its constituted scope and depth; it supplies neither a
    fixed project goal nor proof of the person's comprehension or exhaustive discovery.
  a withdrawal keeps the snapshot at the person's word and, apart from it, the boundary that last
    stood in the run, if any; it sets no boundary from there.

/-! ── COMPOSITION ──
*: product — (D₁ × D₂) → (R₁ × R₂). Dimension resolution remains context-bound.
A receiving protocol or delegate reads DefinedBoundary with its context: the whole map, its record,
and its citations, never an uncited task list. It resolves the relevant entry's question,
applicability, dependencies, limits, and cited sources before relying on a disposition or content. A
grant is the arrangement governing a decision (`governing`): the disposition recorded in this run,
reaching only what was shown of it, or, where none is, a disposition fixed by a cited earlier
decision of the person who holds it, read through that source and reaching only what the source
states — a cited fact, not a disposition of this run. Where both bear on one decision and differ,
the disposition recorded in this run governs: it is the person's current words. An open item's
governing arrangement carries the origin it stands on, so an earlier decision's grant is read
through its source, not as this run's. A proposal and open content are read as such.
UserSupplies leaves the person to supply the value. AIPropose permits proposal work while the
person keeps the selection. AIAutonomous permits choice only inside the
governing arrangement's reach, and that choice is recorded as yours. A missing entry, an unreadable
citation, or a changed prerequisite leaves that judgment unresolved; where examination needs
evidence or a capability this run lacks, name what is needed and keep the judgment pending; continue
independent authorized work and reopen the affected boundary before dependent settlement. A grant to
perform work preserves every checkpoint whose own contract requires the person's response, and
reassignment does not enlarge authority. This protocol defines the boundary; it does not execute or
enforce downstream work.

## Mode Activation

- `/bound` remains directly invocable.
- When a decision boundary or the structure needed to judge it is undefined, invoke the protocol with the available task context. Keep goal, success criteria, and scope open where the user has left them open.
- During AI-guided activation, apply current safety boundaries, capability limits, and explicit instructions. Skip activation when source-defined direction already settles the requested boundary, when nothing on the map would await the user and no turn of theirs would be owed, when the user expressly requests proceeding without this interaction, or when the same unresolved finding was dismissed and its ground has not changed.
- On explicit invocation where no item on the map awaits the user's disposition and no turn of theirs is owed, the first turn is the one that shows the standing boundary (`converge`), with a path to reopen missed structure.

## Protocol

- At the first round, show the relevant whole draft before asking the user to choose its applicable parts or examination depth. Give every included item its decision-relevant reason, what getting it wrong would cost, and its conditional connections. State the scope of discovery and what is unknown; do not require the user to invent an obligation inventory. What the user already said enters the map as theirs; what you add is marked as your proposal.
- When the goal is open, distinguish the work that can investigate it, the judgment that would select it, and obligations conditional on that selection. Propose a way to handle those questions without supplying an unchosen goal.
- In every round, make existing user decisions, choices made inside a grant, unaccepted proposals, facts relayed from earlier decisions, and unresolved items recognizable through their source and setting status. Put the choices still open beside the round's question, show every proposal that would entrust an irreversible later act to AI with its reach, place your contrary grounds, where you hold any, before the question, and keep the way to accept the boundary as it stands recognizable, in the user's language.
- When the user opens an axis, show the concrete content, assumptions, alternatives, and dependent consequences needed for that axis; the turn that shows it serves the request, and a boundary that stands keeps standing, open to the user's next words where they bear on it. Keep the whole overview in view and offer deeper examination or correction where it matters. Decision-rights detail and proposed-content detail can differ by axis; derive the depth from the response rather than a fixed menu of levels.
- At an opened settlement question, materialize UserSupplies, AIPropose, and AIAutonomous in the user's idiom: the user supplies the decision, AI proposes for the user's selection, or AI chooses within stated limits. A displayed default is one of these proposals and binds only through its actual acceptance.
- When the user corrects an assumption, the scope, or the question the boundary answers, the next round reads the corrected context: revise affected content and obligations, show their changed implications, and preserve independent commitments. Keep excluded or conditional parts legible in the map where they matter to later reliance; the residual lists what is still open.
- When the user accepts the boundary as it stands and no turn of theirs is still owed, stop at that depth; where one is owed, the round serves it first. The acceptance takes the proposals it covers only where each was shown as yours with its deciding evidence and your contrary grounds, where you hold any; what it does not cover stays open in the residual. Present the constituted whole and its remaining questions without asking for a second approval of the same arrangement.
- When no item on the map awaits the user's disposition and no turn of the user's is owed, the turn that shows the standing boundary (`converge`) presents it and says that it stands; the user's next words reopen it where they bear on it.
- When a response is not yet readable as continuing, accepting, or withdrawing, the user's turn is owed even where nothing awaits: the next round shows the candidate readings with their consequences, and nothing is committed from the unsettled reading.
- When the user turns to other work, answer it; the boundary stays as it stood — a gate that holds keeps holding and a boundary that stands keeps standing — and nothing is closed on the user's behalf.
- Before handing off or using a resulting boundary, read the COMPOSITION contract with its cited sources. Preserve the holder of every retained judgment, the reach of each grant, and any condition that must be revisited.
- When composing a round whose terminology, quotation, neighboring material, or phase order needs attention, read `references/round-composition.md` before presenting it.

## Rules

- **Recognition over Recall**: Present structured options with anticipatable post-selection states.
- **Round composition**: Keep each judgment beside its nearest evidence and next-move implication, and place analytical context before the gate.
- **Observation before showing**: At the start and at every reply that bears on the boundary — except a settled withdrawal, read at the user's word — observe what the map needs from the reachable sources before showing it, without changing existing state; name and hand over what needs a change of state, a permission, or another's authority. Collect as far as reach allows, read whole what you say you read, name what conflicts with what, name what was not reached in the turn that shows the map, and leave what remains as the person's own unknown in the residual.
- **Whole before selection**: Construct and present the relevant provisional whole before asking what to settle, inspect, or entrust; the user's existing goal and map can remain incomplete.
- **Progressive examination**: Let the user's response open, deepen, replace, or close axes of that whole. Serve requested examination in the next turn — a boundary that stands keeps standing — and a request to see content adopts none of it.
- **Dynamic rendering**: Keep boundary questions and examination dimensions runtime-grounded, with recognizable seeds and a path to extend or replace the framing.
- **Source-bound settlement**: A disposition is made only by a user's utterance that supports it; a proposal, an AI turn, inspection, and silence dispose nothing. Record who put each disposition forward and how it stood, apart from each other. An AI proposal is adopted only where it was shown as yours, with what decides it and your contrary grounds, where you hold any, before the user's turn; apply acceptance only within its actual referent and limits.
- **Entrustment reach**: An entrustment reaches what was shown of it. A later act that cannot be undone is entrusted only where its consequence was shown by kind, target, and limit; an earlier authorization of the same kind, target, and limit is not asked for again.
- **Dependency revision**: Reconcile changed ground and transitive dependents before the next round or the reading where the boundary stands, retaining supported decisions and recording unresolved consequences.
- **Prior-map provenance**: Read an earlier boundary through the turns it cites. Its citation still points at the same source; whether that source still supports the settlement is judged against the context that now stands, and an unreachable or unsupported setting is advisory. An earlier decision relayed from a record is a cited fact, not a disposition of this run — whether it fixes a decision's content or who settles it.
- **After closure**: Never rewrite or veto a user's disposition. Attach your contrary grounds to the boundary where the user set it over them, raise a disposition again only on new evidence, and show that evidence before any dependent step that cannot be undone.
- **Settlement across delegation**: Carry and read the source-defined question, judgment holder, limits, dependencies, and residual at downstream use; work reassignment and a summary supply no additional grant.
- **Closing**: Keep the way to accept the boundary as it stands recognizable in every round, with every irreversible AI-delegation proposal in view. The boundary stands where no turn of the user's is owed (your `owed` reading) and they accept it or no item awaits their disposition; silence and other work leave the run as it stood, and scan exhaustion or a visit count supplies no acceptance.
- **Ambiguous response routing**: Read mixed responses whole; when materially different futures remain viable, continue and present those readings and their consequences. Commit nothing from an unresolved reading. Never ask the user to classify their own words into the disposition forms.
- **Form feedback**: Derive each round's density from the current request; carry an explicit form instruction until countermanded. Change the form directly. Content, wording, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere remain fixed; state what changed and, where the instruction overlaps a fixed element, what stays and why.
