This run uses the vertical-slice SDLC strategy. In addition to the three files above, create
exactly one machine-readable decomposition plan and no application code yet:

- .factory/slices.json — an object with a "slices" array, planned and self-checked as below.
  The controller validates it strictly; a plan that fails validation parks the run.

DECOMPOSE AGAINST THE FROZEN BRIEF, NOT AGAINST THE FILE STRUCTURE.
Read requirements.json carefully. Number the items of brief.acceptanceScenarios in order as
SC-1, SC-2, ... — those are the frozen end-to-end scenarios. Every scenario must be fully
deliverable by the end of the slice plan and must be referenced from at least one slice
acceptance criterion as a tag like "[SC-1]". If a scenario cannot be mapped onto a slice,
the decomposition is wrong — re-plan instead of leaving it out. Cross-cutting constraints
(mobile, keyboard access, privacy, the /health and /_factory/metrics contract, production
build) ${followOn ? "are already met by the released app; keep them intact instead of re-planning them" : "belong to the walking skeleton slice; do not sprinkle them speculatively across\nlater slices"}.

A good vertical slice is the smallest increment that:
  1. delivers one or more whole scenarios or a coherent chunk of one scenario end-to-end
     (UI through logic to persistence) — never a horizontal layer such as "all models",
     "all routes", or "all styling";
  2. leaves the app runnable and demoable, with its whole suite green, at the end of the
     slice — no dangling half-features, stubs that lie, or commented-out work;
  3. adds no criterion that is speculative ("nice later") or that duplicates an earlier
     slice's criterion — re-implementing earlier slices is the top waste;
  4. lists in dependsOn only the earlier slices whose outputs it actually builds on.
Keep the plan to 2-6 slices. ${followOn
    ? `This is a follow-on release: factory.json, the production build, GET /health and
GET /_factory/metrics already exist, so there is NO walking-skeleton slice — slice 1 is the
first increment of this release, verified against the already-running app.`
    : `Slice 1 must be a thin walking skeleton: the manifest
(factory.json version 1 — commands.install/test/build/start as argument arrays,
healthPath "/health", metricsPath "/_factory/metrics"), a production build, GET /health and
privacy-preserving GET /_factory/metrics — so every later slice is verified against a
running, health-checked app from the first gate.`}

Each slice object needs:
  - id: SCREAMING-SNAKE, unique (e.g. "SLICE-RECORD")
  - title: short human name
  - objective: one sentence stating the observable outcome
  - acceptance: array of concrete, individually testable criteria (at least one). Tag each
    criterion that delivers a frozen scenario with "[SC-n] " at the start; untagged
    criteria are allowed for edge cases the scenarios imply. Two slices must never contain
    the same criterion.
  - demo: one sentence an observer can act on to confirm this slice works (what to open or
    run and what should happen) — used by review, not by gates.
  - dependsOn: optional array of EARLIER slice ids this slice builds on.

SELF-CHECK BEFORE YOU FINISH: (a) re-read every acceptance scenario and confirm an SC-tag
for each one exists somewhere in the plan; (b) walk the plan as a build order — could each
slice's demo be demonstrated and its suite stay green given only earlier slices? (c) confirm
no slice re-implements an earlier slice and no two slices share a criterion; (d) ${followOn
