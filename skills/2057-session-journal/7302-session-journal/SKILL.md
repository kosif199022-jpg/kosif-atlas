  Cross-session task-state journal for coding agents — an in-repo, self-ignoring
  journal under docs/session-journal/ so work state survives context compaction,
  /clear, and resume: which task threads are in flight, WHERE each one lives
  (worktree / branch / PR# / issue or tracker link), how the threads relate, and
  a bounded conversation-compression block (decisions / open questions / user
  direction / focus / next action) that the harness auto-summary drops. Two
  tiers: the durable cross-session index `_active.md` that EVERY new or cleared
  session reads, plus a per-session `<session-id>/` DIRECTORY holding
  `_detail.md` and any draft files authored that session — a terminal SessionEnd
  trashes that WHOLE directory. Hooks inject it; this skill is the WRITE/maintain
  side. Use it PROACTIVELY, without being asked, whenever you start / pick up /
  close a task, create a worktree, open a PR, a plan changes revision, you make a
  load-bearing decision, or you sense a compaction is near — and at session
  start, to reconcile it against reality. TRIGGER: session journal · update the
  journal · record this task · track this thread · what's in flight · where was I

# /session-journal — Cross-session task-state journal

> **Iron Law:** state that tells you *where you are working* — worktree, branch,
> PR#, the tracked issue/plan and its status — must live in the journal, not only
> in chat context. Chat context is erased by compaction and `/clear`; the journal
> is not.

## The failure mode this prevents

A session begins as a small bug fix in its own worktree (shipped as a PR), then
drifts into a *different* feature's planning, with only an auto-compaction in
between — no `/clear`. Compaction quietly drops the "I'm inside the bug-fix
worktree" fact, and the continuation gets confused about which tree it is in and
nearly redoes shipped work. The journal makes that impossible: the location of
every live thread is written down and re-injected after every compaction.

## Two-tier model + storage

All journal files live under **`docs/session-journal/`**, resolved against the
**main repo root** (so it is the same directory from inside any worktree) — or,
when `SESSION_JOURNAL_ROOT` is set, under `$SESSION_JOURNAL_ROOT/<main-root path
with "/" → "-">/`, outside the tree. `journal.sh dir` prints the resolved path;
never hardcode either form. The
directory **ignores itself** — `init` drops a `*` `.gitignore` inside it, so the
journal is local-only working state that can never be committed, and the host
project's own `.gitignore` needs no entry. That is what keeps your task notes,
and anything sensitive you jot in them, out of version control.

- **`_active.md` — cross-session index.** Every *unclosed* thread across all
  sessions, one compact block each, with a back-link to the owning session's
  detail file. This is the durable tier: it survives `/clear` and is read by
  every new session. A `/clear` mints a new session id, so without this index a
  fresh session would know nothing about threads it didn't itself open.

- **`<session-id>/` — per-session directory.** Holds this session's `_detail.md`
  (full thread detail + the conversation-compression block) **plus any scratch /
  draft files** authored during the session (design notes, a plan draft, …). The
  whole dir survives this session's compactions and `--resume` (same id). A
  `/clear` starts a new id + new dir and trashes this one via the SessionEnd
  hook — UNLESS an open `_active.md` thread still back-links it, so a **mid-cycle
  draft is kept until the thread closes**, then gc'd with the dir. LEGACY
  sessions are a flat `<session-id>.md` file and coexist; they gc away over time.

Session id == `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (it equals the transcript `.jsonl`
filename). You rarely need it directly — the script defaults to it.

## Use the script, don't hand-roll bash

**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/journal.sh`** is the single, stable
implementation of every mechanical operation. The hooks and this skill both call
it so path resolution and the file skeletons never drift. Run it from anywhere —
it self-anchors to the main repo root, so the working directory does not matter:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/journal.sh" init
```

The table below abbreviates that to `journal.sh`; always invoke it by the full
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` path, which the harness expands for you.

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `journal.sh dir` | print the journal directory |
| `journal.sh init [SID]` | create `_active.md` + this session's `<sid>/_detail.md` (idempotent) — **do this first** |
| `journal.sh detail-path [SID]` | path of a session's detail file (`<sid>/_detail.md`, or a legacy flat `<sid>.md`) |
| `journal.sh plan-path SID ARTIFACT` | path of a scratch/draft file inside the session dir (`<sid>/<artifact>.md`) |
| `journal.sh active-path` | path of `_active.md` |
| `journal.sh list [DAYS]` | show every journal file with its age + keep/GC status (use this to see what is deletable) |
| `journal.sh gc [DAYS]` | trash stale orphan detail files (default 14d) — runs automatically at session start; rarely run by hand |

`init` writes correctly-structured skeletons with the field layout baked in; you
then fill them with `Edit`/`Write`. `inject` and `cleanup` exist for the hooks —
you do not call those by hand.

## When to write

The journal is only useful if it is current. Update it at these moments — treat
them as the trigger, not an explicit user request. (Several of these are also
backed by an automatic nudge hook — see *What is automatic vs your job* — but the
hook only reminds; writing the entry is still your job.)

- **Session start** — read what the hook injected, then reconcile it against
  reality (a PR may have merged, a worktree may now exist). Fix stale lines.
- **Open / pick up a task** — `journal.sh init`, add a thread block.
- **Create a worktree / open a PR / branch** — record *where the thread lives*
  immediately. This is the single highest-value field.
- **A plan changes revision or status** — update the thread's Plan line
  (link + status); the plan body itself stays in your tracker.
- **A load-bearing decision, a user correction, or a fork resolved** — add it to
  the compression block while it is fresh.
- **You sense a compaction is near** (long turn, lots of tool output) — flush
  current focus + next action so the post-compaction self can recover.
- **Close a task** (merged / shipped / abandoned) — remove the thread from
  `_active.md` **and delete its block from the detail file too**. A fully
  completed task leaves no record in either tier — don't leave a "done" stub
  behind; if it was the session's last thread, reset the detail file to the empty
  `init` skeleton. **Delete the journal record only once the task is genuinely
  closed out** (merged AND any tracker close-out landed), not on merge alone.

## `_active.md` — the cross-session index

Keep each thread to a compact block. Prune ruthlessly: a thread that has merged
or shipped must leave `_active.md` the same turn, because the hook re-injects
this file into *every* session — a stale "open" thread is actively misleading.
Per-thread fields: title · status, **Lives** (worktree / branch / PR# / main
tree), **Plan** (tracker/issue link + id · status, omit if none), **Next** (one
line), **Detail** back-link, **Relations**.

**Edit individual thread blocks; never whole-file `Write` `_active.md`.** It is
the one file parallel sessions share, and it has no lock. A targeted block
`Edit` lets concurrent sessions' changes coexist — and a stale one fails loud
(`old_string` not found → re-read), which is the guard. A whole-file rewrite
clobbers another session's in-flight update. Add, change, or prune one block at
a time. (Per-session detail files are session-id-keyed, so they never contend —
this rule is only about the shared index.)

## `<session-id>/_detail.md` — the detail file

Two parts: a **Threads** section (one block per thread with Lives / Plan /
Progress / Next / Relations) and a **Conversation compression** block.
Discipline that keeps it useful:

- **Update in place** — overwrite the relevant lines; never append a running log.
  Git is not tracking this, so there is no history to preserve here.
- **Bounded** — keep the whole file under ~150 lines, each thread under ~12. If
  it grows past that, you are dumping transcript, not compressing.

## Conversation compression — the part the harness summary drops

The harness auto-summary captures the gist of the dialogue but loses exactly the
load-bearing scaffolding: which task/plan, where it lives, how threads relate,
*why* a decision was made, and which of the user's instructions are still in
force. That scaffolding is this block's job. Fill these six lines and keep them
tight:

- **Key decisions** — what was decided **and why** (the why is what you can't
  reconstruct later).
- **Open questions** — unresolved forks awaiting an answer.
- **Standing directives** — one-line instructions that bind for the REST of the
  session (the language to answer in, what to stop asking before doing, a scope
  boundary), verbatim. WHY: said once and in passing, they read to the summarizer
  as chat rather than as contract, so this is the class it reliably drops — one
  three-compaction session had "explain it in Chinese" re-issued twice and a scope
  boundary told three times, the third time visibly out of patience. Hearing a
  directive a second time is proof the last compaction dropped it — write it in
  then, not later.
- **User corrections / direction** — steers on the work itself, near-verbatim.
- **Current focus** — the one thing in hand right now.
- **Next action** — the immediate next step.

## Relationship vocabulary

Name how threads relate so a future session doesn't treat a blocked thread as
ready:

- **deferred-behind** — X waits on Y (X cannot start until Y reaches a point).
- **blocks** — X blocks Y (the inverse, stated from X's side).
- **sibling** — same cycle, independent, can proceed in parallel.
- **parent** — both belong to one parent feature.
- **supersedes** — X replaces Y; Y should be closed/abandoned.

## What is automatic vs your job

- **Automatic (SessionStart inject):** the SessionStart hook injects `_active.md`
  + this session's detail file on startup / resume / clear / compact, and runs a
  light `gc` first. The SessionEnd hook trashes the per-session detail file on a
  *terminal* end. `_active.md` always persists. **Worktree self-identification:**
  the inject also reads this tree's git branch — when it *uniquely* matches a
  thread's `Lives:` line, a ▶ banner names that thread so a `/clear`'d worktree
  session resumes the right one without being told. A shared `main`/`master`
  branch or an ambiguous match never auto-binds — it falls back to the plain
  index for you to pick from.
- **Automatic (write-side nudge):** a `PostToolUse` hook
  (`session-journal-nudge.sh`) fires a one-shot reminder the moment you enter a
  worktree or run a `gh pr create` / `git worktree add` / `git push -u` — the
  exact actions that mint the highest-value `Lives:` field, mid-session, after
  the SessionStart reminder has scrolled out of context. It is non-blocking (just
  a prompt to record where the thread lives); acting on it is still your job.
- **Your job (this skill):** keeping the content true. The hook re-injects
  whatever you last wrote — garbage in, garbage re-injected. Prune `_active.md`
  when a thread closes; that is also what lets `gc` reclaim the detail file.

## Lifecycle & cleanup — what gets deleted, and when

Deletion uses `trash` (recoverable) where available, falling back to `rm`. There
is one **retention rule** that both the SessionEnd cleanup and `gc` obey:

> A detail file is **never** deleted while it is the current session, while it is
> `_active.md`, or while an **open `_active.md` thread still back-links to it**.
> Everything else is an orphan.

- **`/clear` or logout** (SessionEnd) → trashes *that session's* detail file —
  unless it is still referenced by an open thread (then it is kept; the work
  isn't done). A plain quit / Ctrl-C does **not** delete (it may be resumed).
- **Session start** (every startup / resume / clear / compact) → `gc` trashes
  orphan detail files that are stale. "Stale" is measured against the **newest
  session in the chain**, not wall-clock: a file is only eligible when it is
  more than `DAYS` (default 14) older than the most recently active session. So
  while a chain of sessions is still being worked, its older members survive.
  Once the whole chain goes quiet the reference stops advancing and nothing new
  becomes eligible.

To see what is deletable, run **`journal.sh list`** — it prints each file's age
and one of: `KEEP` (current / index / referenced), `GC-eligible`, or `orphan,
kept (within window)`.

## What this is not

- **Not your issue tracker / plan DB** — that holds plan content; this holds
  working state + pointers. Never duplicate plan bodies here; link to them.
- **Not long-term memory** — persistent preferences/corrections belong in your
  agent's memory system. The journal is task/thread working-state only.
- **Not a commit log or changelog** — git owns history. The journal tracks
  current state only; update in place.
- **Not a verbatim transcript** — the compression block is bounded and
  structured. If you are pasting dialogue, stop and compress.
