# Makefile Template

Create `Makefile` in the project root with the following content.

Replace `PROJECT-NAME` with the project name.

Recipe lines must be indented with literal tabs, not spaces.

```makefile
.PHONY: build test fmt format lint check run clean release test-scrut test-scrut-update test-all lint-md format-md lint-actions help

build: ## Build the project
	zig build

## Notes

- `check` is the whole point of this file. It runs the format check, the build and the tests in one command, so there is a single thing to run before pushing instead of a hand-spelled `zig fmt --check ... && zig build && zig build test` that comes out slightly different every time.
- `fmt` checks and `format` writes, matching `set-up-ci`'s Zig Makefile. This is the opposite of the more common `fmt`-writes convention, so read the target before running it in an unfamiliar Zig project.
- `fmt` and `format` delegate to the `fmt-check` and `fmt` steps in `build.zig` rather than calling `zig fmt` directly. That keeps one list of paths in the build script, and it is what makes `build.zig.zon` actually get checked: the usual `zig fmt --check src/ build.zig` silently skips the manifest.
- `lint` is `fmt` plus `build` because Zig has no separate linter. The compiler catches most of what a linter would, so a debug build is the closest equivalent.
- `release` writes per-target directories under `release/`, which the `.gitignore` template excludes. Zig cross-compiles all five targets from one machine with no extra toolchains.
- `release` installs each target straight into its own prefix with `zig build --prefix`, and clears `release/` first. Building into the default `zig-out/` and copying from it instead puts every target's leftovers in every directory: `zig build` does not clear the install prefix between runs, so a Windows build leaves a `.exe` and a `.pdb` behind that the next target's copy picks up.
- The scrut targets are a starting point and deliberately export no binary variable, matching `scaffold-rust-cli`'s Makefile. The add-scrut-cli-tests skill derives that variable from the binary name, uppercased with hyphens replaced by underscores and suffixed `_BIN` (`my-tool` becomes `MY_TOOL_BIN`), and uses the same name in the snapshots and in CI. Pre-seeding a different one here, `BIN` for instance, would leave the generated tests referring to a variable these recipes never set. Run that skill to add the test files and the variable together.
- `lint-md`, `format-md` and `lint-actions` cover the non-Zig files. They invoke `markdownlint-cli2`, `prettier` and `actionlint` directly rather than through package-manager scripts, matching `scaffold-rust-cli`'s Makefile: a scaffolded Zig project has no `package.json`, so a `yarn lint` target would fail on a fresh scaffold with nothing to run. They still need the tooling that `set-up-linters` installs, so they fail until that skill has run.
