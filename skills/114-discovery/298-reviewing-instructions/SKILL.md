# Instruction Review

Score AI-facing instruction files and report findings an author can act on. The
target style: outcome and done criteria up front, each rule stated once, hard
constraints explicit, nothing the model already knows, portable across agent
targets. The writing-skills skill teaches the same style to authors.

Done when every in-scope file has a score, a cited reason per dimension, caps
applied, and a confidence level, and every finding quotes or locates its
evidence.

## References

- `references/scoring-rubric.md` — dimensions, bands, caps, confidence, and
  defect labels. Read for every review.
- `references/model-context.md` — read when the target names a model family or
  the user passes `--model`. Default context is generic.
- `references/calibration.md` — read when a score is borderline, confidence is
  low, or you are comparing two versions.

## Scope

- Input is a file, a directory, or a skill or agent name. A bare name expands to
  `src/skills/<name>` or `src/agents/<name>.md`.
- For one file, review that file unless the user asks for linked files. For a
  directory, review its entrypoint plus the support files it links or contains.
- With no scope, list likely entrypoints (SKILL.md, AGENT.md, AGENTS.md,
  CLAUDE.md, body.md, prompt and rules files) and ask one question before
  reviewing more than one skill, agent, or package.
- Package JSON is routing evidence only; manifest review belongs to
  evolving-config.
- Put ambiguous candidates under Candidates Not Reviewed with the reason.

## Pre-pass

When a shell is available, run the advisory linter on the scope:

```bash
uv run python src/skills/reviewing-instructions/scripts/lint-instructions.py <scope>
```

Confirm or dismiss each warning during review; the rubric decides. If the script
cannot run, record `Structural pre-pass: skipped (<reason>)` and continue.

## Review

Judge each file against its own job: a read-only reviewer needs different limits
than an apply flow, and a reference file needs no routing description. Pick the
band first, apply caps, and name the top one to three improvements by impact.
Local project rules win over vendor guidance; report the conflict. For repeated
scoring or reranking, keep the scope, model context, and rubric version fixed.

## Output

```markdown
## Instruction Review Report

Model context: <family or generic> — source <source>
Rubric version: <date>
Review confidence: high | medium | low

### Summary

- Files reviewed: N
- Candidates not reviewed: N
- Structural pre-pass: <confirmed and dismissed warnings, or skipped reason>
- Score range: X-Y / 10
- Main risk: <one sentence>

### Scores

path/to/file.md — overall X / 10, confidence <high|medium|low>

- Caps: none | capped at N because <reason>
- Outcome and Done: X — <evidence>
- Routing: X — <evidence>
- Consistency: X — <evidence>
- Hard Constraints: X — <evidence>
- Concision: X — <evidence>
- Progressive Disclosure: X — <evidence>
- Portability: X — <evidence>

### Findings

1. path:line — <high|medium|low> <dimension[/label]>: <issue>. Evidence: <quote>. Fix: <change>.

### Top Improvements

1. <highest-impact change>

### Candidates Not Reviewed

- path — <reason>
```

Omit empty optional sections. When no findings survive the evidence check,
`No confirmed findings.` replaces only the Findings section; Summary and the
per-file Scores with evidence stay.

## Platform additions

### Arguments

From `$ARGUMENTS`: the first non-flag token is the scope; `--model <name>`
overrides model context; `--team` fans out review tasks for large scopes;
`--rerank` compares two versions per `references/calibration.md`.

### Parallel review

Review one file or one small skill folder directly. For several independent
files or packages, run at most 3 Task reviewers at once, batched by sorted path.
Give each the exact file list, the resolved model context, the path to
`references/scoring-rubric.md`, and the evidence rule.

When results return, drop out-of-scope files, recompute caps a task skipped, and
deduplicate findings by file plus dimension. If two scores differ by more than 1
point, compare caps first; report unresolved disagreements as low-confidence
notes instead of averaging.
