description: Load mandatory SolidWorks conventions, design rules, task-relevant knowledge documents, standards data, and initial design-rule checks before any modeling or CAD code. Use at the beginning of every SolidWorks create, modify, repair, assembly, drawing, or API task, before touching SolidWorks; also use its final phase before save and export.

# SolidWorks Pre-Start

Run all phases in order. Do not model, generate CAD code, or call a SolidWorks
API until Phases 1 through 4 complete or a documented KB outage forces the
offline fallback.

## Phase 0: non-negotiable engineering requirement (ENG-001)

**This phase has no network dependency and is exempt from the offline fallback.**
The KB carries the same rule as a convention, but a documented outage must never
be the reason it stops applying.

Do not create schematic, decorative, conceptual, simplified, placeholder, or
visually representative components.

**Every component must be a real, functional, manufacturable, technically
accurate part. No component - regardless of size or importance - may be created
merely for visual representation.**

For every individual component, including a single screw:

1. Research it against reliable technical sources: peer-reviewed papers,
   engineering references, manufacturer documentation, and the latest
   applicable standards.
2. Design from validated research - engineering principles, formulas,
   calculations, material properties, manufacturing constraints, tolerances,
   and safety requirements.
3. Justify every value. Dimensions, geometries, connections, interfaces, loads,
   clearances, fasteners, materials and mechanical properties must all be
   realistic and technically defensible.
4. Never invent. No assumptions, invented specifications, arbitrary dimensions,
   fake mechanisms, or purely visual detail.
5. Cite the standards, formulas, calculations and references used for each part.

**Model every physical component separately.** If an assembly contains 10,000
parts, all 10,000 are researched, engineered and modelled individually. No group
of parts may be replaced by a simplified block, visual shell, placeholder,
texture, or symbolic representation. This covers screws, nuts, washers,
bearings, seals, cables, connectors, welds, joints, gears, springs, housings,
electronic components and internal mechanisms alike.

The finished design must be fully functional, physically realistic,
engineering-accurate, dimensionally consistent, manufacturable, properly
assembled, based on validated calculations, compliant with the latest applicable
standards, and free of decorative, fictional or representational parts.

### When the information is not available

If sufficient technical information or reliable references are unavailable for a
component, **do not fabricate or guess.** State plainly what is missing and what
must be researched or specified before that component can be designed accurately.

Stopping to ask is the correct outcome. A plausible-looking part built from
invented numbers is a failure, not a partial success - it looks finished and
will therefore be trusted.

An offline KB makes this *more* likely to be the right answer, not less: losing
the standards tables means less grounding for a dimension, never permission to
invent one.

Set `KB_HOST` from `SW_KB_HOST`; default to
`https://sw-plugin.ideep.org`. Use `curl` through the shell for every runtime
request. Quote the complete URL. Do not use browser or web-fetch tools for this
KB.

On Windows, run `curl.exe` instead of `curl`: in Windows PowerShell 5.1
`curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, which rejects curl options such
as `-sS`. `curl.exe` is the real curl in every Windows shell.

## Phase 1: conventions

Run:

```text
curl -sS "{KB_HOST}/api/knowledge?kind=convention"
```

Load every returned `body` once per Codex task. Treat conventions as hard rules
unless the user explicitly overrides one. Read Persian and English documents.
Expect conventions for metric units, ISO 2768-mK defaults, material defaults,
fully-defined parametric sketches, `PRJ-<part>-NNN` naming, `work/` and
`exports/` paths, clean rebuilds, assigned material, rule checks, STEP, and
drawing PDF deliverables.

If required geometry or safety input remains unknown, ask the user; a KB
default does not authorize inventing geometry-driving values.

## Phase 2: active design rules

Run:

```text
curl -sS "{KB_HOST}/api/design-rules"
```

Skip entries with `deprecated: true`. Internalize the rest by category.
Enforce severity as follows:

- `critical`: block until resolved;
- `high`: fix before completion;
- `medium`: fix unless the user explicitly overrides;
- `low`: advisory, apply when possible.

## Phase 3: task knowledge

Create a concise URL-encoded query for the requested component and likely
SolidWorks features, then run:

```text
curl -sS "{KB_HOST}/api/knowledge/search?q={query}"
```

Read the top five to eight results, or up to ten for a complex assembly,
thread, or sheet-metal task. Prioritize `playbook`, then `reference`,
`strategy`, and `convention`. Read the complete reference for every SolidWorks
API method about to be used. Fetch a known document with
`GET /api/knowledge/{slug}` when necessary.

## Phase 4: initial rule check

Build a JSON object from known values. Omit unknown keys; never fabricate them.
Typical fields are:

```json
{
  "welded": false,
  "tolerance_class": "m",
  "process": "machined_aluminum",
  "wall_thickness_mm": 2.0,
  "nominal_dimension_mm": 50.0,
  "fastener": "M8",
  "hole_mm": 9.0,
  "material": "6061-T6"
}
```

POST it with `curl`:

```text
curl -sS -X POST "{KB_HOST}/api/check-context" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@<context.json>"
```

React to each result:

- `pass`: continue;
- `fail`: stop CAD work and fix the input, explaining the rule and change;
- `warn`: flag it and fix when possible;
- `advisory`: apply it as a design constraint;
- `na`: ignore it.

Do not proceed while `summary.fail` is greater than zero.

## Phase 5: standards on demand

Query only the table needed for the current decision:

- `GET /api/standards/materials[/<name>]` for density, yield, and modulus;
- `GET /api/standards/fits` for ISO 286 hole and shaft deviations;
- `GET /api/standards/clearance_holes[/<designation>]` for ISO 273 holes;
- `GET /api/standards/tolerances_iso2768` for general tolerances;
- `GET /api/standards/fasteners[/<designation>]` for fastener geometry;
- `GET /api/standards/sheet_metal_gauges` for gauge thickness;
- `GET /api/standards/preferred_numbers` for R-series dimensions.

Record units. The KB database convention is mm, MPa, and g/cm3.

## Phase 6: final rule check

After geometry is complete and before final save or export, POST a more
complete final context to `/api/check-context`. Resolve every `fail`; document
all advisories in the session `issues` narrative.

## Offline and error behavior

- Unreachable server: record `KB offline - proceeding without pre-start
  checks` and continue using verified engineering context.
- Search `404`: continue with available knowledge.
- Check-context `422`: retry once with fewer fields, then continue and record
  the issue.
- `5xx` or timeout: skip the failed phase and record it.

The KB accelerates the task; it is not a gatekeeper.
