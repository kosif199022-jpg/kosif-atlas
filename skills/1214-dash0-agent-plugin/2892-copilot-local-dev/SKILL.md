description: Install and run the Dash0 GitHub Copilot CLI plugin (the copilot/ package) locally for development/testing — no GitHub push or release needed. Use when you want to try or test the Copilot plugin against a real `copilot` session, iterate on it, or tear the setup down.

# Run the Dash0 Copilot plugin locally

The public install path (`copilot plugin marketplace add dash0hq/dash0-agent-plugin`
+ `copilot plugin install dash0-agent-plugin@dash0`) needs the branch pushed and a
release carrying the `copilot-on-event` binary. For **local dev** we skip both by
registering a throwaway **local marketplace** (the repo's real
`.github/plugin/marketplace.json`, renamed so it can't clash with the production
`dash0` one) that points at this repo's `copilot/` package, installing it the real
way, and dropping a **locally-built** binary where the bootstrap looks (so it skips
the download).

This exercises the actual packaging — manifest loading, camelCase `hooks.json`,
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolution, the `dash0-configure` skill, the bare-install guard —
not a hand-wired approximation.

## Install / update

Run the setup script (idempotent):

```bash
.claude/skills/copilot-local-dev/setup.sh
```

It stages the marketplace, `marketplace add` + `plugin install`s it, and builds
the binary into
`~/.copilot/plugin-data/dash0-local/dash0-agent-plugin/bin/`.

The install registers the hooks itself, through the manifest's `hooks` key. If a
session emits no spans, run with `--log-level debug --log-dir <dir>` and grep the
log for `hook`: a fired hook logs `[hook stderr] dash0: …`.

Then, **once**, set credentials + enable native OTel — start `copilot` and run:

```
/dash0-configure
```

(That writes `~/.copilot/dash0-agent-plugin.local.md` and installs a launch
function enabling Copilot's native OTel into
`~/.local/state/dash0-agent-plugin/copilot/otel` — the source of per-turn
token/cost/model.) Open a **fresh shell**, then use `copilot` normally; tool and
chat spans land in your Dash0 dataset.

## Iterate

- **Changed Go code** (`cmd/copilot-on-event`, `internal/source/copilot`): rebuild only —
  `.claude/skills/copilot-local-dev/setup.sh --rebuild` — then start a new `copilot` session.
- **Changed plugin files** (`copilot/hooks.json`, `plugin.json`, the skill, the bootstrap):
  full re-run — `.claude/skills/copilot-local-dev/setup.sh` — to reinstall.

## Teardown

```bash
.claude/skills/copilot-local-dev/teardown.sh
```
Removes the plugin, the marketplace, the plugin-data + OTel dirs, and the config
file. (Also remove the launch function / `COPILOT_OTEL_*` exports from your shell
profile if you added them.)

## How it maps to the real install (and caveats)

- `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` → `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/dash0-local/dash0-agent-plugin`;
  `${COPILOT_PLUGIN_DATA}` → `~/.copilot/plugin-data/dash0-local/dash0-agent-plugin`.
  The `plugin-data/…/bin` dir is created lazily on first hook run; setup.sh pre-creates it and drops the binary.
- Native OTel is **not** something the plugin can enable itself (no plugin `env`/OTel hook);
  it needs the launch-time env, which is exactly what `/dash0-configure`'s launch function provides.
- setup.sh copies `copilot/` wholesale — the shipped package is clean. The dev-only capture
  harness lives outside it under `test/capture/copilot/`, so it never ships (guarded by
  `TestCopilotShippedPackageExcludesDevOnlyDirs`).
- setup.sh reuses the repo's real `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (only its `name` swapped to
  `dash0-local`), so this exercises the actual marketplace file that ships to users.
- Hooks come from the manifest, the same as a real install. Verified on macOS
  against CLI 1.0.80: with no `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json` naming the plugin, a
  session logged `[hook stderr] dash0: connected (v0.1.22)`. Windows is
  **unverified** — an earlier version of setup.sh registered the hooks at user
  scope as a workaround, and that file is now removed on setup and teardown
  because two registrations run the bootstrap twice per event.
