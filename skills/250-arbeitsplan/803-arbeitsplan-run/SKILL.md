name: arbeitsplan-run
description: Executes a compiled workflow as a redundant swarm — N candidates over the same scope in their own git worktrees, judged blind, exactly one landed. Use after arbeitsplan-compile, or when the user asks to run the workflow, start the swarm, or build several versions and pick one. Halts and surfaces rather than retrying when candidates fail; convergence comes from widening, never from repeating. Writes only inside candidate worktrees until the landing step.

# Run the swarm

N candidates build the **same scope** in isolation. Exactly one lands. The rest are deleted.

That is what makes a merge conflict impossible here: this is the same worktree isolation
`superpowers` uses, inverted. There, N worktrees do *different* work and must all be
reconciled — which is why `subagent-driven-development` forbids parallel implementers inside
one worktree "(conflicts)" and pushes the parallelism up to where the conflicts reappear.
Here, N worktrees do *the same* work and N−1 are discarded. Nothing is ever merged.

## Steps

1. **Read `workflow.json`.** Read the file; do not work from a summary of it. Refuse a
   `schemaVersion` other than `"2"` rather than guessing at it. Then branch on
   `backend.kind` — it is a decision the spec already made, never yours to re-make:
   `workflow` → follow [The workflow backend](#the-workflow-backend) below; `matrix` →
   `arbeitsplan-matrix`; `in-session` → the steps here.

   A phase with `mode: "plan"` never runs under the lock: `worktree_pool.py open` refuses it,
   because plan mode plus an open lock leaves no legal write. Close, run that phase in plan
   mode, then open the next one.

2. **Open the run scope lock** before any dispatch:

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" open --spec analysis/arbeitsplan/<runId>/workflow.json --phase build
   ```

   This writes `analysis/arbeitsplan/run_scope.json`, which arms the guard. It is a
   **per-dispatch lock, not repo-level state** — that distinction is why this guard does not
   sweep up every other plugin's edits the way one in this repository once did.

3. **Create one worktree per candidate**, one angle each, from `workflow.json`'s `angles`.

4. **Dispatch the batch in ONE message.** Multiple dispatch calls in one response run in
   parallel; one per response is sequential. Each `arbeitsplan:candidate-builder` gets its
   angle, its worktree, the scope, and the acceptance list — and **never** another
   candidate's angle or output.

   These are in-session dispatches, so the guard sees each one. The workflow backend is a
   different run, compiled for it — never switch to it mid-run.

   **Record each builder's result** as it returns — the JSON it printed, saved to a file —
   with its own worktree:

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/record_event.py" candidate --run <runId> --phase build --result c2.json --tree .arbeitsplan/<runId>/c2
   ```

   This writes `candidates/c2.json`, the file `reconcile.py` (step 8) and `land_candidate.py`
   (step 9) read; nothing else writes it on this backend. `--tree` replaces the builder's
   self-reported `diff` and `filesTouched` with what its worktree actually holds, and notes
   whether they differed — builders paraphrase long diffs, and a paraphrased diff does not
   apply. It refuses a phase that was never opened, a result missing any field of
   `candidate-builder`'s output shape, and a candidate already recorded, writing nothing.

5. **Apply the breaker, per batch, never cumulatively.**

   - Exclude every `measured: false` candidate from the denominator. It is not a rejection;
     it is a candidate that was never fairly tried.
   - `measured == 0` → **acquisition problem.** The environment failed, not the contract. Fix
     the environment and re-run. Do not re-dispatch into a broken environment.
   - `accepted * 3 < measured * 2` → **contract problem.** Halt and say so: *the correct
     response is a better contract, not more agents.*

6. **Referee blind.** One `arbeitsplan:candidate-referee` per surviving candidate, each given
   the criteria and that candidate's diff only — never the builder's rationale, never another
   candidate. Landing is an **allowlist**: only `accepted`.

   Record the batch — every verdict the referees returned, as one JSON list — under the referee
   phase you opened:

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/record_event.py" referee --run <runId> --phase <refereePhase> --verdict verdicts.json
   ```

   This writes `referee/<id>.json` (what `land_candidate.py` reads) **and** the
   `referee/<phase>/<id>.json` twin that `rounds.py` rebuilds rounds from. Without it an
   in-session run has no rounds, and step 7's `rounds.py decide` can never route a shared hole
   or stop a moving residual. It refuses a phase that was never opened, a malformed verdict,
   and a (phase, candidate) already recorded — and writes nothing when it refuses.

7. **Select by rule**, not by preference: most criteria met, then fewest files touched, then
   candidate id. If no candidate is `accepted`, **halt and surface**. All N failing the same
   way is a statement about the contract — do not just widen and re-dispatch. Run
   `scripts/rounds.py record --run <runId>` (from the root holding `analysis/arbeitsplan/`) to
   rebuild this run's rounds, then `scripts/rounds.py decide --rounds <file> --spec
   workflow.json` (see [Rounds: a shared hole or a moving residual](#rounds-a-shared-hole-or-a-moving-residual-78-93)
   below) to learn which of three things this halt is: `ROUTE CONTINUE` (nothing to say yet),
   `ROUTE SYNTHESIZE criterion=<id>` (a **sharedHole**: relaunch at the single-writer phase with
   `carry.sharedHole` set, rather than building N more candidates against the same hole), or
   `ROUTE HALT moving-residual` (stop outright: the last several rounds each "advanced" on a
   *different* blocker, which is not convergence).

8. **Measure the winner against its own tree, before landing** (#76). A builder's self-reported
   exit codes are never trusted on their own:

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reconcile.py" --run <runId> --run-checks --candidate c2 --tree .arbeitsplan/<runId>/c2
   ```

   This RUNS every checked acceptance criterion now, with `cwd` set to `c2`'s OWN worktree, and
   records each as an `execute_tool` event in `run.jsonl`, carrying `detail.candidate == c2`. Any
   disagreement with what `c2` itself reported — in either direction — prints `CONTRADICTION` and
   exits 1. `land_candidate.py --apply` (next step) **refuses** a candidate lacking this
   measurement for any checked criterion, or whose latest measurement contradicts its report;
   another candidate's measurement never unlocks it. An honestly-reported failure a referee
   already accepted is not blocked here — the gate is "unmeasured or contradicted", nothing more.

9. **Land exactly one diff.**

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" open --spec ... --phase land
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/land_candidate.py" --run <runId> --candidate c2 --apply
   ```

   Optional gated synthesis, only if the spec opted in: one further writer, given the winner
   plus **explicitly named** elements to borrow. It must beat the plain winner on at least one
   declared criterion, or the plain winner lands unchanged.

10. **Delete the losers** — worktrees and branches — then record the phase as closed and close
    the lock:

    ```bash
    python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/record_event.py" phase --run <runId> --phase land --status closed
    python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" close
    ```

    `close` **refuses** a phase that recorded no terminal event. On a halt, close with
    `--halt "<the specific reason>"`: a halt is an event in `run.jsonl`, never an absence.

11. **End the run in the record** -- landed or halted, always last:

    ```bash
    python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/record_event.py" finish --run <runId>
    ```

    A landed run gets `complete.json` (refused while any phase is still open); a halted one
    gets `FAILED-<stamp>.json` carrying the halt's reason; anything else is refused, because
    stopping is not an ending. This marker is what `sweep_artifacts.py` waits for -- a run
    without it is kept forever, whatever state its worktrees are in.

    Deletion itself goes through `worktree_pool.py destroy` (or `sweep_artifacts.py` for a whole
    finished run), which never just discards a loser's uncommitted state (#80): a DIRTY worktree
    is committed and preserved on `kept/<runId>-<cid>` before its worktree and throwaway
    `arbeitsplan/<runId>/<cid>` branch are removed; a clean worktree gets no `kept/` branch.

## Referee-owned artifacts (#77)

If `workflow.json` declares `refereeOwned`, its `referee-fixture` phase runs first, exactly
like any other phase (open the lock, dispatch its `agentType`, record the output, close). Once
it has written those paths, baseline them **once**:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/referee_owned.py" record --run <runId>
```

A second `record` for the same run is refused: the baseline is taken at creation, never
re-taken to accommodate a later change. `worktree_pool.py open` already narrows a fan-out
phase's lock to exclude every `refereeOwned` path, so the guard denies a candidate's Edit/Write
before it lands — but that covers only the tool calls the guard's matcher sees. Re-verify
before landing (step 9), as the belt to that guard's suspenders:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/referee_owned.py" verify --run <runId>
```

`land_candidate.py` independently refuses (citing `refereeOwned` by name) any candidate diff
that touches one of these paths, so the same rule is checked three ways: at the lock, at
landing, and by content.

## Rounds: a shared hole or a moving residual (#78, #93)

A no-accept halt is arithmetic (`accepted * den < measured * num`) and never looks at WHY.
`scripts/rounds.py` is the one place that does, and both rules below read the SAME derived
rounds — one round per referee phase, rebuilt from `referee/<phase>/<id>.json` and the
adjudicator's recorded `round: {outcome, blocking}` — so a fix to one is a fix to both. Those
files come from `record_event.py workflow` (the workflow backend) or `record_event.py referee`
(in-session, step 6); a batch recorded any other way is invisible here:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/rounds.py" record --run <runId> > /tmp/rounds.json
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/rounds.py" decide --rounds /tmp/rounds.json --spec analysis/arbeitsplan/<runId>/workflow.json
```

- **`ROUTE SYNTHESIZE criterion=<id>` — a `sharedHole` (#78).** The LATEST round accepted no
  one and >= 2 rejected candidates share one unmet criterion — a structural hole every
  candidate hit, not noise. Relaunch `workflows/run.js` with `startAt` at the single-writer
  phase and `carry.sharedHole = {criterion, candidates: [{candidateId, diff}]}` (the run.js
  halt's own `rejectionsByCriterion`, paired with each candidate's diff, builds this). The
  synthesizer then works from every rejected diff toward that one criterion, instead of N fresh
  candidates re-discovering the same hole from scratch.
- **`ROUTE HALT moving-residual` (#93).** A per-batch breaker and a `sharedHole` both look at
  ONE round; a run that "advances, not closes" every round, each time naming a *different*
  blocking condition, passes both forever. This fires when the last N **judged** rounds
  (`judge.outcome != "none"`; an unjudged round neither breaks nor counts) are all `"advanced"`
  with non-null, pairwise-**distinct** `judge.blocking` ids — N genuinely different obstacles in
  a row, not real convergence. Stop outright: **do not** re-compile and **do not** widen again.
  `N` is `--max-advancing-rounds`, else the spec's `roundBreaker.maxAdvancingRounds`, else 3.
  When both rules would fire on the same rounds, the `moving-residual` HALT wins.
- **`ROUTE CONTINUE`** — neither condition holds; proceed as normal.

## Stacked fan-outs across waves (#79)

A later wave's builders should sometimes start from an **earlier wave's refereed winner**,
not from HEAD — that is what a `fanout-redundant` phase's `base: "<phaseId>"` declares. Once a
phase's candidate is selected (step 7 above) and would normally just land (step 9), promote it
instead if a later phase names it as `base`:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" promote --run <runId> --phase build-w1 --candidate c2
```

This commits everything sitting in that candidate's worktree — untracked files included — and
points `arbeitsplan/<runId>/base/build-w1` at the new commit. The next wave's `create` then
reads it automatically:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" create --spec analysis/arbeitsplan/<runId>/workflow.json --phase build-w2 --count 2
```

If `build-w2` declares `base: "build-w1"`, every worktree this creates starts from the promoted
branch instead of HEAD; if `build-w1` was never promoted, `create` **refuses**, naming the
missing branch, and creates nothing. A `--phase` whose phase carries no `base` (or `create` with
no `--phase` at all) behaves exactly as before: from HEAD.

Base branches deliberately **survive** an ordinary `worktree_pool.py destroy --run <runId>` — a
still-pending later wave may need to stack on one. Only pass `--bases` once the whole run is
actually done with them:

```bash
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/worktree_pool.py" destroy --run <runId> --bases
```

`compile_spec.py --strict` is the check that a stacked run actually declared every `base` it
needed: a `fanout-redundant` phase whose transitive `requires` reach another `fanout-redundant`
phase with no `base` chain reaching it back prints `WARNING ... [AP-SIBLING-INVISIBLE] ...`
naming both phases. A plain compile still writes past a warning (exit 0); `--strict` treats one
as a rejection (exit 1) — run compilation with `--strict` before dispatching a stacked run.

## The workflow backend

When `backend.kind` is `"workflow"`, the whole phase graph runs inside `workflows/run.js`,
and this session does only the things the Workflow tool cannot: read files, run plan-mode
phases, measure the accepted candidate with `reconcile.py --run-checks` (#76), and land.

1. **Launch it with the spec as data.** The Workflow tool has no filesystem, so pass the
   parsed `workflow.json` verbatim: `args: {spec}` (plus `startAt` and `carry` on a resume).
   No run-scope lock is open while it runs — nothing inside writes the shared tree.
1b. **Arm the script allowlist when the spec has a `script` phase (#107).** `compile_spec.py
   --write` already wrote `analysis/arbeitsplan/<runId>/scripts.json` from the spec; point the
   guard at it before launching:

   ```bash
   printf '{"runId": "%s"}\n' <runId> > analysis/arbeitsplan/scripts_armed.json
   ```

   The guard judges every Bash call `arbeitsplan:script-runner` makes — lock or no lock — and
   allows exactly one declared command per dispatch. Without an armed allowlist the runner is
   denied everything, which is the safe direction. For `{placeholder}` slots, pass their values
   as `carry.scriptArgs.<phaseId>`; a value outside `[A-Za-z0-9._/,=:@+-]` halts the phase
   before dispatch.
2. **Persist what it returns, before reading it.** Every return carries `events`:

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/record_event.py" workflow --run <runId> --result result.json
   ```

   A halt is an event. Record it even — especially — when the run aborted.
3. **On `pending_plan_node`, run that phase here, in plan mode**, by dispatching its
   `agentType` with the carried data. Record its output, add it to `carry` under the phase id
   (`carry.contract.acceptance` replaces the compiled acceptance for later phases), and
   relaunch with `startAt: <resumeWith>`. Loop state lives here, never in the script.
   That same command writes `candidates/<id>.json` and `referee/<id>.json` for every
   candidate the return carries, once each, never overwriting.
3b. **Record a plan-mode phase's output** the same way:
   `record_event.py phase-output --run <runId> --phase <id> --output <file>`. An adjudicator's
   `verdict: "land"` is what gives a borrowed synthesis its referee record; without it,
   `land_candidate.py` refuses the synthesis like any unjudged candidate.
3c. **On a NO CANDIDATE ACCEPTED halt, `rounds.py` decides the next move, not this session.**
   The halt's `rejectionsByCriterion` is already grouped by criterion; run `scripts/rounds.py
   record --run <runId>` then `scripts/rounds.py decide --rounds <file> --spec workflow.json`
   (see [Rounds: a shared hole or a moving residual](#rounds-a-shared-hole-or-a-moving-residual-78-93)
   above — same rules, same `sharedHole` and `moving-residual` outcomes, whichever backend ran
   the halted batch). A `SYNTHESIZE` route relaunches `run.js` with `startAt` at the
   single-writer phase and `carry.sharedHole` set, from the same halt's `rejectionsByCriterion`
   and `candidates`; a `moving-residual` HALT stops the run outright.
4. **On completion, measure then land in-session.** `worktree_pool.py open --phase <last>`, then

   ```bash
   python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reconcile.py" --run <runId> --run-checks --candidate <id> --tree .arbeitsplan/<runId>/<id>
   ```

   to measure every checked criterion against the accepted candidate's own tree (#76), then
   `land_candidate.py`, where the hook, the `writeScope` check, and this measurement gate all
   run. The workflow never lands. `land_candidate.py` writes `landed.json`, with `divergedFrom`
   if what landed differs from the recorded candidate. Then end the run with
   `record_event.py finish --run <runId>` -- after a halt too -- exactly as step 11 above.

## Rules

- **Never re-dispatch an identical prompt.** The hook denies it, and the denial is correct:
  past the cap those rounds do not converge, they only cost. Widen instead — a new angle
  nobody tried — or stop.
- **Never let a builder write to the shared tree.** Only the landing step touches it.
- **Never treat an unmeasured candidate as a failure.** It has no rate, only missing data.
- **Never raise the budget mid-run.** That is a decision to re-compile.
- **Delegation nests at most 3 deep, and never in a cycle** — both enforced by the hook, see
  `references/delegation.md`. A dispatch to arbeitsplan's own agents is fan-out and is not
  counted; a dispatch to another plugin is.
- **A denial from another plugin's guard is that plugin doing its job.** Report it; never
  reach for its escape hatch.

## Output format

```
arbeitsplan run — ap-2026-09-12-a3f1, phase build
  c1  middleware-layer       measured   checks 3/3   diff 2 files
  c2  decorator-per-route    measured   checks 3/3   diff 2 files
  c3  reverse-proxy-config   UNMEASURED no nginx toolchain in the worktree

  breaker  accepted 2 / measured 2  (c3 excluded from the denominator) — pass

phase referee (blind)
  c1  rejected   a3 not met: requirements.txt gains 'slowapi'
  c2  accepted   3/3, evidence at src/api/search.py:41

  marker   .takt/ap-2026-09-12-a3f1/landed

dispatches 7/9 budget.
```

A halt is an output, not a crash:

```
arbeitsplan run — ap-2026-09-12-a3f1 HALTED at phase referee
  accepted 0 / measured 3 — every candidate failed criterion a1 the same way.
  All three read the limit from a per-process dict, so a1 ("429 across workers")
  cannot be met inside the declared writeScope at all.
  This is a statement about the contract, not about the candidates.
  The correct response is a better contract, not more agents: re-compile with a
  scope that admits shared state, or drop a1.
  Nothing was landed. Worktrees kept at .arbeitsplan/ap-2026-09-12-a3f1/ for reading.
```
