name: arbeitsplan-preflight
description: Read-only inventory of what a swarm run can and cannot do in this repository before any tokens are spent. Use before arbeitsplan-compile or arbeitsplan-run, when the user asks whether this repo is ready for a swarm, or when a run failed and the cause might be the environment rather than the work. Reports git/worktree support, test commands, other plugins' live guards, and any open run lock. Writes nothing.

# Preflight

Know what is on the bench before measuring it. A run that discovers mid-swarm that the repo
cannot make a worktree has already spent N dispatches on a result it cannot use.

## Steps

1. **Git and worktrees.** Is this a git repository? Can it create a worktree here — is the
   candidate directory ignored? A repo that cannot make worktrees can still use the matrix
   backend, so report the alternative rather than just failing.

2. **Acceptance checks.** What test command does this repo actually use? A run whose criteria
   carry no runnable check cannot be refereed, and that is better known now.

3. **Other plugins' live guards.** Report every guard that would see this run's edits — takt,
   cupertino, lehre, andon, zeugnis, befund, nacharbeit — and its marker. A fix pass runs
   under them, and a denial from one is that plugin doing its job.

   **Never suggest another plugin's escape hatch.** Naming it as an inventory fact is
   reporting; recommending it is helping the user disable someone else's guard.

4. **Existing state.** Is `analysis/arbeitsplan/run_scope.json` open, and how old? Is
   `.claude/takt.local.md` present, and does it carry this plugin's provenance key?

5. **The matrix backend.** Is `claude` on PATH? Is `timeout` or `gtimeout` available (cells
   run untimed without one)? Is this session nested — because if so, the matrix runner will
   refuse, correctly, and the user must run it from a terminal.

6. **Toolchains (#107).** When a design exists, `compile_spec.py --design --spec <design>`
   prints one `TOOLCHAIN <name> <probe>` line per runtime its commands name — script nodes,
   acceptance, setup, gates, smoke. Run each probe; **exit 0 means installed**, whatever it
   prints (`go version` and `java -version` share no output convention). A missing toolchain
   makes the design not ready. For a wave design, also report the helper runtime: a Python
   >= 3.10 (`python3`, `python` or `py -3`) that `install_waves.py` will resolve, and whether
   this checkout is the **primary** one (`git rev-parse --git-dir` equals `--git-common-dir`) —
   a wave run launched from a linked worktree halts at its first node.

7. **Say what the run can and cannot measure.** A missing checker means the phases that need
   it are listed as skipped, never silently passed. Name them.

## Rules

- **Writes nothing.** Not even a state directory.
- **Never infers a missing checker as present.** If there is no test command, say the
  acceptance criteria will have to be structural, and say what that costs.
- **Refuse to go further on an open lock.** Hand the user the release command. A stale lock
  denies every edit, which is the safe direction, and only a person decides to release it.

## Output format

```
arbeitsplan preflight — /Users/x/proj
  git                 yes (worktrees supported, .arbeitsplan/ is gitignored)
  test command        go test ./...        (from the Makefile's `test` target)
  claude on PATH      yes
  timeout             gtimeout (coreutils)
  nested session      YES — the matrix runner will refuse; run it from a terminal
  toolchains          go (go version) ok · shell (sh -c true) ok · julia (julia --version) MISSING
  helper runtime      python3 3.12.3 (>= 3.10) · primary checkout: yes

other guards live in this repository (a run executes under them; a denial from one is
reported, never bypassed):
  cupertino    marker .cupertino
  takt         marker .claude/takt.local.md  (no arbeitsplan provenance key — hand-written)

run lock: none open
state: workflow.json=absent, run_scope.json=absent, matrix results=absent

Can measure: every phase. Cannot measure: nothing skipped.
Design not ready: julia is named by node conform-jl and is not installed here.
Caution: takt.local.md is hand-written. arbeitsplan-compile will REFUSE to overwrite it.
Next: arbeitsplan-compile to turn a problem into a spec.
