# Web Development

Follow the existing template language, asset pipeline, and conventions. Add a dependency, build step, or framework only when the project already uses it or the user approves; requests that need a SPA framework belong to writing-typescript.

## HTML and CSS

- Semantic HTML first; HTMX or JS only where native behavior falls short. `button` for actions, `a` for navigation, `details`/`summary` and `dialog` before custom widgets.
- Label every control; group with `fieldset`/`legend`; use native input types, validation, and `autocomplete`. Add ARIA only when HTML cannot express the state.
- Mobile-first, fluid CSS: `gap`, logical properties, `rem`/`clamp`. Design tokens in custom properties; one-off values stay local.
- `:focus-visible` styles, and animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. `!important` only at integration boundaries.

## HTMX

- Use HTMX when the server owns the state or the fragment. Set explicit `hx-target` and `hx-swap`, and return fragments shaped for that target.
- Keep the form's `action` and `method` so it still works without JS.
- Send CSRF and auth headers through the project's existing mechanism.
- Request not firing: check trigger, target, swap, response status, and CSRF/auth headers before adding a JS fallback.

## JavaScript

- Small scoped modules, event delegation for dynamic content, no new globals.
- Render untrusted data with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, unless the project sanitizer marks it trusted.
- Clean up timers, observers, and listeners on elements that can be swapped out.

## Checks

UI changes need a look at mobile and desktop widths and keyboard navigation. Use browser-automation for rendered checks, screenshots, and interaction tests.

Done when the relevant build/test/lint checks pass on what you changed, or you name each check that did not run and why.
