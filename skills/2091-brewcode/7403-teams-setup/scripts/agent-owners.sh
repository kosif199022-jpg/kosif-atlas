# Prints every team whose `## Agents` roster lists <agent-name>, one team name per line,
# sorted (the `.codex/teams/*` glob order), no duplicates, nothing else on stdout.
#
# `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` is a PROJECT-GLOBAL namespace, not a team's private slot: two teams
# may list the same agent. Deleting it because team A was cleaned up removes an agent team B still
# spawns. Every delete path MUST call this first and SKIP any agent with more than one owner.
#
# Run from the project root -- paths are relative to `.codex/teams/`, same as its siblings.
#
# stdout : owning team names, one per line (empty when there are none)
# exit 0 : one or more owners printed
# exit 2 : no team lists this agent (stdout empty) -- safe to delete
# exit 1 : refuse to answer -- usage error, invalid agent id, or a team.md whose roster could not
#          be parsed (reason on stderr, stdout empty). Treat as "unknown owners": never delete.
