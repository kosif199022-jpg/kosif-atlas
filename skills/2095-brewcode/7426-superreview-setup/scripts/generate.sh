# brewcode:superreview-setup generator script
# Adapted from setup.sh copy_review_skill(): copies the emit templates into the TARGET project
# (.codex/skills/superreview/) substituting SCALAR placeholders, then validates that NO setup-time
# {PLACEHOLDER} remains. Multi-row BLOCK placeholders are filled by the AI via Edit (see SKILL.md Phase 3).
#
# Usage: generate.sh <mode>
#   scan        - Report target tech stack, agents, rules, source/test dirs (Phase 1)
#   emit        - Copy + scalar-substitute templates into <cwd>/.codex/skills/superreview/ (Phase 2)
#                 AND create-or-reuse <cwd>/.codex/agents/intent-guard.toml.
#                 Also saves PRISTINE copies of the templates it emitted from under .template-baseline/ — that
#                 baseline is what makes `upgrade` able to tell a TEMPLATE change apart from Phase 3 tailoring.
#                 REFUSES to overwrite a live installation (the emitted skill SELF-SYNCS — Phase 4b — so its
#                 SKILL.md and references/scope.md carry edits no template knows about). "Live" = ANY emitted
#                 artifact on disk (see `_live_artifacts`), not SKILL.md alone: a PARTIAL install must not be
#                 re-substituted with DEFAULT scalars. SUPERREVIEW_FORCE=1 overrides and DESTROYS those edits.
#   upgrade     - Refresh a LIVE installation without touching hand-edits (Phase 2b): stages a fresh emit next
#                 to it and reports, per file, the NEW TEMPLATE vs the .template-baseline/ copy — IDENTICAL |
#                 DIFFERS (real template delta) | MISSING -> restored RAW (NEEDS PHASE 3) | NO BASELINE (pre-baseline
#                 install: falls back to live-vs-template, tailoring included). Live file CONTENT is never
#                 written; the AI applies the template delta with targeted Edit calls. The one live write is an
#                 UNCONDITIONAL metadata restamp (version/generated_by/last_updated, one `RESTAMP:` line per
#                 file, body compared byte-for-byte) — without it a version bump, which reports IDENTICAL on
#                 every asset, could never clear the `stale` verdict setup-status reads off the emitted
#                 SKILL.md frontmatter. The per-stack reference is RE-DERIVED from the installed tree
#                 (see `_installed_stack_refs`), never re-defaulted — see `UPGRADE_STACK=` on stdout.
#                 Runs on ANY live install, SKILL.md included in the restorable set — so it is also the remedy
#                 for a partially damaged install, which `emit` refuses to touch. A DISABLED install (parked
#                 SKILL.md.disabled) is refused with `enable` as its remedy, never silently resurrected.
#   emit-agent  - Create-or-reuse <cwd>/.codex/agents/intent-guard.toml ONLY. No superreview skill is
#                 written, read or required. Used by $brewcode:teams-setup, which must not author its own copy.
#                 Prints exactly one `INTENT_GUARD:` line on STDOUT: `INTENT_GUARD: CREATED <path>` |
#                 `INTENT_GUARD: REUSE <path>` | `INTENT_GUARD: MIGRATED <path>` (a pre-standard agent of
#                 ours, restamped in place — tailored body preserved). Diagnostics go to stderr and never
#                 break that contract.
#   validate    - Fail if any unresolved setup-time {PLACEHOLDER} remains (Phase 4)
#
# Env overrides (honored by BOTH emit and emit-agent; SUPERREVIEW_FORCE=1 lets emit overwrite a live install):
#   PROJECT_NAME, TRACKER_LABEL, SPEC_LOCATION, PLAN_LOCATION, POLICY_LOCATION
#   (emit also honors STACK_LABEL, STACK_REF, SOURCE_GLOB, PATHSPEC_GLOBS, ARBITER_AGENT,
#    VALIDATOR_AGENT, SCOPE_AGENT_A, SCOPE_AGENT_B; upgrade honors STACK_REF as an override of the
#    stack it derives from the installed tree, and ignores the rest — see upgrade_skill)

# EVERY token check in this script goes through here. A placeholder is `{UPPER_SNAKE}`, but that is a SUBSTRING of
# the shell expansion `${UPPER_SNAKE}` — and after Phase 3 the emitted artifacts hold real shell: the shipped
# SKILL.md.template alone already carries `${MAIN}`, `${REPORT_DIR}`, `${ROOT}`, `${TOK}`, none of which ever
# appears as a bare token. Those four sit in `validate`'s `_runtime` allowlist purely so the loose pattern would
# not flag them, which masked the defect for exactly the names the template happened to use: a Phase 3 evidence
# command adding `${BASE}` or `${HOME}` was reported as an unresolved placeholder and failed `validate`, and in
# `_ig_kind` it was worse than a failed gate — it classified a correctly tailored agent as BROKEN and RECREATED
# it, destroying the tailoring.
#
# So: strip the colliding shell form FIRST, then scan what is left. A leading-guard pattern like
# `(^|[^$])\{[A-Z_]+\}` was rejected — with `-o` it consumes the guard character, so ADJACENT tokens
# (`{A_B}{C_D}`) silently lose the second one and the reported name comes out as `x{TOKEN}` instead of the token
# the user has to fix. Stripping first has neither problem and needs no `grep -P` lookbehind (absent on BSD grep,
# i.e. on the user machines this generator runs on).
#
# Only `${UPPER_SNAKE}` is stripped, which is exactly the colliding set: `${lower}` and `${VAR:-default}` do not
# match the token shape in the first place, so nothing else is weakened.
#

#
#   ABSENT  no file                                                       -> CREATE from the template
#   BROKEN  empty, or OURS (stamped) and unrunnable                       -> RECREATE, after a .bak-<ts> copy
#   CURRENT OURS, current format: carries the tail anchor IG_STAMP_PREFIX  -> REUSE, byte-untouched
#   LEGACY  OURS, pre-standard: carries a RETIRED `intent-guard template vN` stamp and no current anchor
#                                                                         -> MIGRATE (restamp in place)
#   FOREIGN no stamp of either generation                                 -> REUSE, byte-untouched
#
# PROVENANCE IS DECIDED FIRST, and that ordering is the whole point (BCOP09). The runnability tests
# (`name:` frontmatter, unresolved {UPPER_SNAKE}) used to run BEFORE the stamp probes, which made FOREIGN
# unreachable for any hand-written file that merely MENTIONED a `{TOKEN}`: such a file was classified
# BROKEN and overwritten from the template, with no backup. A file we did not write is never judged by
# template rules and never rewritten — its tokens are reported as a conflict and it is REUSED as-is.
# Only an EMPTY file (nothing to lose) or one carrying our own stamp can be BROKEN.
#
# LEGACY is the case the reader (`setup-status`) reports as `stale (legacy stamp)` and promises "one
# `upgrade` restamps it". Recreating it would destroy the project's Phase 3 tailoring, so the migration
# moves METADATA ONLY: the four frontmatter keys and the tail anchor. Every tailored line survives.
# FOREIGN is the reason REUSE exists and stays untouchable — a hand-written agent is never judged by, nor
# rewritten to, template rules (see validate c2). The {UPPER_SNAKE} test is deliberately independent of the
# stamp: raw tokens make a file broken whoever wrote it. It runs through `_scan_tokens`, so a Phase 3 evidence
# command holding `${HOME}` is shell, not a placeholder — misreading it here RECREATES a tailored agent.
