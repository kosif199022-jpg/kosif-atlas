verify_dos.py — the semantic exit for dos-extract.

A schema validator only asks "is this well-formed?"; the guarantee is checking the
PRODUCT against "what a clean DOS looks like". This enforces the mechanical half of the
quality criteria and FLAGS (does not decide) the semantic half.

Usage:
    python verify_dos.py <dos.yaml> [--decisions decisions.md] [--waive Name,Name]
                                    [--terms terms.txt] [--core-only]
                                    [--max-lines 800] [--max-description-chars 200]

Exit 0 = no rejects (may still carry needs_semantic_review flags and warnings).
Exit 1 = >=1 REJECT.

A DOS is two layers, and this script checks both:
  - the CORE MODEL — `objects` (≤7 aggregates, the napkin), `relationships`, `rules`, `composition`;
  - the UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE — `vocabulary`: every other term the team says (values, enum members,
    artifacts, roles, processes, terms owned by a neighbouring context), each with a kind, an owner
    (`of`), a definition, synonyms and rejected names. Until v0.11.0 the ≤7 cap was the ONLY
    layer, so the ~40 real terms Judgment 1 sorted into value / enum / composition / external
    survived only as decisions.md prose — invisible to every closure check downstream, which is
    what "the DOS extracts a sliver and aligns nothing" looks like from the outside. No ontology
    methodology caps concepts (Ontology 101 step 3 enumerates exhaustively; METHONTOLOGY and NeOn
    start from a glossary); they layer, and so does this file.

Mechanical guarantees (a breach is a REJECT — the non-waivable half):
  - <=7 core objects (else reject; ontology pollution / skipped Judgment 2 or 4 — or a long-tail
    term that belongs in `vocabulary`, not in another object)
  - `vocabulary` present and non-empty (a core model without its language is half a DOS) —
    waivable only by `--core-only` / a `core_only` waiver, for a to-be proposal derived before code
  - every vocabulary entry: `kind` in the closed set (dos_closure.VOCABULARY_KINDS), a non-empty
    `definition`, `of` (required for value / enum) resolving to a declared object / composition /
    term, `context` (required for external), `status` in active | deprecated | proposed
  - no term declared twice: a vocabulary key that is also an object / composition key, a synonym
    that is somebody else's canonical key, a name listed as both synonym and rejected_name
  - `--terms terms.txt` (count_terms.py format, or one label per line): EVERY counted label
    resolves through the closure — objects, compositions, vocabulary, synonyms, rejected names,
    rule ids. This is the coverage gate: a term the docs use N times that the DOS cannot place is
    the extraction's loss, reported by name. Without --terms coverage is reported as `unmeasured`.
  - every relationship subject/object is a declared object (or one of its synonyms)
  - every relationship carries a cardinality
  - no object name COMPOUNDED on a UI/impl suffix (TopicCard, UserRepository, …) —
    non-waivable: the high-risk list forbids promoting those, full stop
  - load-bearing sections present: objects/relationships/rules (omission rejects; the other
    9 sections are reported as info, not rejected)
  - open_questions non-empty (a DOS with none is dishonest)
  - a declared `properties.<p>.derived_from` names its source (blank rejects)

Waivable (REJECT by default, cleared by a recorded human waiver):
  - an object name that IS a whole UI/impl primitive (`Card`, `Modal`, `Service`).
    The heuristic exists for `TopicCard`; a whole word can be a real domain object —
    AI-DLC's 卡/`Card`, a card game's `Card`. Judgment 1 decides, the script errs strict.
    Clear it with `--waive Card` or, better, `--decisions decisions.md` carrying a
    `## Naming waivers` section whose bullets start with the waived name:
        ## Naming waivers
        - `Card` — Judgment 1 step 1 passes: a self-contained unit of work, no screen
          in its definition. Whole word, not a `*Card` compound.
    A waived name is not silently accepted: it is reported under `waived` and flagged
    for the judge.
  - MORE THAN 7 objects. The reject text has always said "exceed only with a human
    waiver in decisions.md", but nothing read one — so the lever it pointed at did not
    exist and the only way past was to ignore a permanently red pre-gate. A gate you
    can only pass by ignoring it is not a gate. The waiver uses the same bullet
    convention, named `object_count`:
        ## Naming waivers
        - `object_count` — 8 objects. Judgment 2 (nothing to merge into) and Judgment 4
          (same bounded context) were both applied; see the entry in decisions.md.
    Reported under `waived` and flagged, never silent — and a waiver that does not say
    which judgment it survived is recorded with "no reason recorded" beside it.

Semantic half — FLAGGED as needs_semantic_review, never auto-passed:
  - a label claimed by two concepts (环 → Ring | Loop) is a HOMONYM: the closure refuses it
    unqualified; confirm the split is real (Judgment 2 / 4) and both entries name their context
  - a vocabulary entry of kind external names a context absent from bounded_contexts
  - each agent_guidelines.must_not should trace to an anti_pattern or rule (judge call)
  - confirm each object is truly a business object, not UI/impl that slipped Judgment 1
  - every declared `derived_from` property is a MATERIALISED view: confirm what keeps it
    in sync with its source

Warnings (never affect the exit code — the size/legibility surrogates from
references/methodology.md §6, which until now lived only in prose):
  - dos.yaml longer than --max-lines (default 800: "sections are likely over-detailed")
  - an object description longer than --max-description-chars, empty, or still a
    template placeholder
