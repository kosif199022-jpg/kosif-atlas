# /team-debug — Reproduce, explain, fix

Read `../shared/workflow-contract.md` first.

## Process

1. Read the exact symptom, error, inputs, and relevant logs in full. Establish a minimal reliable
   reproduction before editing code.
2. Trace backward to the earliest divergence between expected and actual behavior. State one
   falsifiable root-cause hypothesis and the evidence supporting it.
3. Test the hypothesis. A focused regression test is preferred when practical; confirm it fails
   for the predicted reason. If it fails differently, revise the hypothesis instead of patching.
4. Search the affected pattern to determine whether this is one instance or a systematic defect.
5. Implement the smallest root-cause fix. Do not bundle unrelated cleanup.
6. Re-run the reproduction, affected tests, and proportional regression checks. Inspect the diff
   and verify error paths or alternate inputs.
7. For an incident (production/fleet breakage, not a routine red test): the fix is not closed
   until a permanent check exists that would catch a recurrence — a regression test, a startup
   tripwire, or a deterministic gate. If none is practical, record a dated reason in the report;
   never skip silently.
8. Report root cause, evidence, files changed, fresh commands/results, pattern scope, the
   permanent check (or the dated reason there is none), and remaining risk. When inside a planned
   workflow, append this evidence to `run.md`.

Keep diagnosis and repair in the retained sub-agent session. Use the shared maximum of 3
corrective rounds across the task. On a repeated failure signature, reconsider the hypothesis or
test premise once. Stop on no progress, exhausted budget or repeated workflow-created obstruction;
a second productive failure alone is not a stop. Complexity needs an external failure boundary.
