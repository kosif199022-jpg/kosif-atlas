# /team-build — Complete the authorized change

Read `../shared/workflow-contract.md` first. Read the plan if present and ground implementation
authority in the conversation. Stop dependent work only for a missing scope, product, trust or
irreversible decision. Keep the same sub-agent through build, tests and fixes.

1. Inspect git state and preserve unrelated changes. Record existing authority and owner settings.
2. Inspect current source; implement the smallest complete change. The owner uses tools directly.
   Only brief logistical or mechanical actions execute directly; substantive work uses the sub-agent.
3. Add meaningful acceptance/regression tests when practical. Confirm the expected failure before
   the fix when useful; use proportional alternatives for mechanical edits or unisolatable behavior.
4. Diagnose unexpected failures with `/team-debug`; apply the shared maximum of 3 corrective rounds
   across the task. Reconsider a repeated failure signature once, and stop on no progress.
5. Inspect the complete diff, run the self-simplify pass (`../shared/workflow-contract.md`) when it
   will be pushed, and run affected checks. Reuse exact unchanged evidence under the shared
   artifact/environment/command rule; do not repeat checks merely to satisfy stage names.
6. Record changes, decisions, evidence, repairs and limitations in `run.md` when used. Obtain the
   risk-appropriate implementation review before shipping, honoring explicit review requests.

No automatic builder swarm, context reset, or cheap-worker handoff. Any independently authorized
work must have exclusive ownership and converge under this owner.
