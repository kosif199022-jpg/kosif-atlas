# Download Book

## Setup (once)

The site sits behind DDoS-Guard, which serves a captcha to headless browsers and to plain HTTP clients. The script therefore drives a headed Google Chrome window through Playwright: it needs Google Chrome installed and the `playwright` package next to the script. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is the installed `intel` plugin root:

```sh
npm install --prefix "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/download-book/scripts"
```

The browser profile persists at `~/.cache/secrets-manager/profiles/download-book`. A Chrome window opens for the run and closes when the script finishes; do not use it meanwhile.

## Run

Run the bundled script with a book title:

```sh
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/download-book/scripts/anna-archive-links.mjs" "Pride and Prejudice"
```

The script searches the first EPUB results page, reads download counts embedded in that page (using the metadata endpoint only when a count is missing), selects the highest count, calls the fast download API, and resolves a slow download link. For the slow link it prefers a "slightly faster but with waitlist" server (these download at megabytes per second after a short queue) over the "no waitlist" servers (immediate but throttled to tens of KB/s), polling the waitlist entry until its direct link appears and falling back to a no-waitlist server if the queue does not clear in time. It prints JSON with the selected record and any links found. The script itself does not fetch the book file. A run takes about 90 seconds — the browser check plus the slow server's queue.

Confirm the selected `title` matches the book the user asked for. The script picks the highest download count on the results page, which can be a different book when the query is loose; if it mismatches, re-run with a tighter query (add the author, edition, or subtitle) before downloading.

## Download

Once a link is found, download the book to `~/Downloads` automatically, without asking the user to approve it. Prefer the `fast.url` when the fast API returned one; otherwise use `slow.url`. Name the file from the book title with a `.epub` extension. For example:

```sh
curl -fL --retry 2 -o ~/Downloads/"<Title>.epub" "<fast.url or slow.url>"
```

The waitlist server usually downloads at megabytes per second, so a `slow.url` finishes in seconds; still run it in the background and report the saved path when it finishes. Verify the result is an EPUB (`file` reports a Zip/EPUB, not HTML) — an HTML result means the link was an error or captcha page, which is unavailable.

To turn the downloaded EPUB into a Chinese PDF, pass it to the `translate` skill, which reads the EPUB directly.

If the browser check still fails (the script reports 未通过浏览器验证, usually a captcha), save the search results and selected detail page as HTML from your own browser, then pass `--search-html` and `--detail-html`. Pass `--slow-html` for a saved slow download page when its live entry is blocked. The saved slow page must refer to the selected MD5 record. `ANNA_SECRET_KEY` optionally supplies a member key for the fast API; do not print its value. Calling that API with a valid key may use the member's quota.

Report missing or blocked links as unavailable. Do not infer a direct file URL from an error page; only download the file URL the script actually returned.
