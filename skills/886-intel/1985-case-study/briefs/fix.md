# Fix brief

Reviewers audited the sourced draft. You apply their findings to one chapter.
Your message names the work directory, the type file, your chapter file and
the tool list. The standard is `references/evidence.md` (next to this brief's
folder); the skill folder is the one that holds this brief's folder.

Your findings: `<skill>/scripts/case-study.mjs findings <work> NN` for your
chapter file's number: the lines tagged with it, and the sources-lens lines
about every label your chapter names. Each line starts with the finding's
name (`F3a9c21`). The command prints only the findings whose name is not yet
in `review/fix-<NN>.md`: after an interruption, what it prints is what is
left. The failed sources: every URL in `<work>/review/*.failed.json`. They
left `sources.json` before the chapter was written; their labels are in the
readers' `notes/*.sources.json`.

Take the findings one at a time: check it, edit the chapter, append its line
to `review/fix-<NN>.md`, then take the next. Never check them all first and
write at the end: a finding with no line is done again from the start when
you are interrupted.

1. Every sentence resting on a failed source is removed or re-sourced.
   Re-sourced means you open the original now and read the fact there. If the
   original cannot be opened, the claim goes.
2. An interview hosted by a seller keeps only the subject's own words,
   labelled self-reported, in a sentence that names the host as a seller.
3. A source never opened is opened now, and the text corrected to what it says,
   or it leaves the text.
4. A quote not found loses its quotation marks and the claim, or takes the real
   wording. A translated quote has the source's words after it in ⟦ ⟧ (see
   "Quotes" in the evidence rules): correct both together. A wrong speaker,
   date or outlet is corrected from the source.
5. Numbers: correct what differs, remove what is not found, relabel what is
   mislabelled, print both sides where sources disagree, and recompute what
   was derived from a corrected figure.
6. A tie between a source and the subject is stated in the sentence where the
   source is used.
7. Privacy findings come first: the sentence and the source both go.
8. The introduction and the reasoning chapter are fixed after the others:
   re-read the fixed chapters first, and rest on nothing they no longer say.
9. When you are sure a reviewer is wrong, leave the text and record why, with
   the source's wording.
10. A fix changes only what its finding names. The sentences around it keep
   their wording and their figures: a figure no finding names has been
   matched against its source already (`review/figures-<NN>.md`) and is not
   removed, re-derived or doubted on your own account. A figure the script
   could not match because it is derived (a rate, a difference, a count of
   rows) stays, with the figures it was computed from beside it.

Anything new you add meets the same rules as the first draft. A source you
add takes a label that is not already a value in `sources.json`.

When every finding has its line, run both checks on your chapter and mend
what they report before you finish:
`<skill>/scripts/case-study.mjs quotes <work> NN` (a quotation not found:
its ⟦ ⟧ words are missing or retyped — copy them from the bullet; a sentence
that names no source — add its label) and
`<skill>/scripts/case-study.mjs figures <work> NN` (a figure not found that
is not derived — correct it from the source or remove it).

Edit only `drafts/<your file>`. Do not edit `sources.json`. Write:
- `review/fix-<NN>.md` — one line per finding, appended right after you
  apply it (see "Writing as you go" in the evidence rules), starting with the
  finding's name: fixed, removed, relabelled, re-sourced (with the new URL),
  or rejected (with the reason);
- `review/fix-<NN>.added.json` — `{"<url>": "<Outlet Year>"}` for every source
  you opened and read in this round and now cite (`{}` when none);
- `review/fix-<NN>.raw.json` — `{"<url>": ["raw/<file>"]}` for the text you
  saved of each of those.

Final message: counts only, plus what you could not resolve.
