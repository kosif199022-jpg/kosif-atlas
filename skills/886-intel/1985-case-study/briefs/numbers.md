# Numbers brief

You build the dated record for a case study from platform records, not from
anyone's telling. Your message names the subject, the type file, the work
directory, your lane (`archive` or `uploads`), and your share of the caps.
Read `references/evidence.md` ("Numbers"), `references/tools.md`, and "What
the numbers must establish" in the type file.

## Lane: archive

You are the only agent that fetches from the archive.

1. Run the curve for every address the profile has had (old user names,
   channel ids, handles, and the statistics-site page for the account):
   `scripts/wayback.mjs curve <work>/raw/archive <address>...`
   It lists the monthly captures, fetches them in one batch, and prints one
   line per capture with the count it could read. Do not fetch captures one by
   one. If it stops with "the archive refused the connection", report that error and
   stop.
2. Rows with `text` but no `value` show a rounded or foreign-language count:
   read the text. Rows with neither: open the saved file and look; a capture
   that is a redirect or an error page is dropped.
3. From the rows, write the curve (at least one point per quarter in the
   growth years, one per half-year after, through today), today's count read
   today, the dated milestones (the first capture at or above each threshold,
   and the last one below it), and the fastest stretch between two points of
   the same kind.
4. Statistics-site captures often carry a daily table: use it for the exact
   milestone days.

## Lane: uploads

List the account's uploads or posts with the platform commands in the tools reference.
Write the earliest posts (date, title, views), the count per month in each
phase, where the cadence or format visibly changed, and what was posted in
the weeks around each acceleration the press mentions.

## Output, both lanes

Append to `notes/numbers-<lane>.md` as you go (see "Writing as you go" in
the evidence rules). Dated tables, one row per line, each row starting
with the chapter tags it serves (`[c03]`, `[c07]`…) and `[on record]`, and
ending with the record's URL. When the lane is done, write three more files;
a script merges them, and a file in another shape is dropped:
- `notes/numbers-<lane>.sources.json` — one JSON object,
  `{"<url>": "<label>"}`, for every record you cite: the URL exactly as the
  rows print it, the label as the chapters will name it (`Internet Archive
  2019-10-01 youtube.com/channel/…`, `YouTube video page 2026`);
- `notes/numbers-<lane>.raw.json` — one JSON object,
  `{"<url>": ["raw/<file>", …]}`: for each of those URLs, the files its page
  was saved to, as paths from the work directory (`wayback.mjs` prints the
  file as `file` next to each `url`);
- `notes/numbers-<lane>.gaps.md` — one line per record you could not read
  (a period with no captures is a gap only after the full capture list shows
  none).

Final message: points on the curve, first and last date, milestones found,
gaps. Nothing else.
