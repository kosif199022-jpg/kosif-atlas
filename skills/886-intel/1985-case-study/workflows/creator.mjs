// args: { subject, work, skill, lang, today, product, seeds, caps, done, fixer }
// skill is the absolute path of the case-study skill folder; product, seeds and
// caps may be empty strings. done names the stages whose files are already in the work directory and are not run
// again: 'read' (the notes and the numbers: the run starts at the draft), 'sources' (the sources lens's findings).
//
// The numbers agents start with the scouts, and each chapter runs write → figures matched + quotes review → fix on
// its own. The barriers are the merge after reading (the sources lens needs sources.json), the sources lens before
// any writer (a failed source's notes are not written up, reviewed and then removed), and the body chapters before
// the introduction and the reasoning chapter (written from them, fixed after them).
