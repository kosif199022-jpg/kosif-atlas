name: analyze-x-mentions
description: Turn a fetched X/Twitter mentions archive (tweets.jsonl from fetch-x-mentions) into a concise, data-driven Chinese reception doc plus charts — hot topics with a dated timeline, what people like, what people dislike, each ranked by frequency over every post and backed by id-verified quotes. Use when asked to analyze/分析 what X is saying about an app, brand or protocol from an existing mentions dataset. NOT for fetching the tweets (the archive must already exist) and NOT for App Store reviews (use analyze-appstore-reviews).

# Analyze Twitter

One app's X mentions → an evidence-only reception doc: an overview, what users
like and dislike about the app, what they ask for, the timeline, and what it means for
us. Every number comes from the JSON; every post is read and labeled by a model (no
sampling, no keyword filter, no clustering model: those drop the concrete content);
every quote is verbatim and id-verified. Concrete beats short: name the feature, the
bug, the number, the date.

## Input & output

- **Input**: `docs/intel/x/<slug>/tweets.jsonl` as written by
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/fetch-x-mentions/scripts/fetch-x-mentions.mjs`
  (one tweet per line with `id, author, text, created_at, likes, replies, lang, url`;
  `clean.mjs` dedups by id). Run
  on a finished archive; pass `--since/--until` to analyze a window of it. The doc
  title states the window.
- **Output**, next to the input: `docs/intel/x/<slug>/reception.md` + `images/`;
  `docs/intel/x/<slug>/labels.jsonl`, one line per post (`id, about, sentiment, topic,
  feature, point, request, interest`), committed, so the next run labels only the
  posts it has not seen and any window can be reported from the store without
  agents; and one shared `docs/intel/x/vocab.json` (`{topics, features, interests}`)
  for every app, the vocabulary seen so far, which seeds the next run's prompt
  and grows after every run on any app (the apps overlap heavily; one list stays
  maintained, one per app goes stale). A windowed run writes
  `reception-<from>..<to>.md` with the shared date prefix written once
  (`reception-2026-09-01..22.md`, `reception-2026-08-15..09-22.md`,
  `reception-2024-01-01..2028-01-20.md`) so it never overwrites the all-time doc.

Every command runs from the repo root; `S="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/analyze-x-mentions/scripts"` below.

## Runs

The store makes every run incremental. Three ways to invoke this skill:

- **First run on an app**: no `labels.jsonl` yet; every clean post is chunked and
  labeled; the all-time `reception.md` is written.
- **New data arrived** ("analyze this week's <app> tweets"): run steps 1–4 on the
  whole archive; chunk.mjs skips every post already in `labels.jsonl`, so only the
  new posts go to labelers; then aggregate with `--since/--until` for the window
  and write `reception-<from>..<to>.md`, or without a window to refresh
  `reception.md`.
- **Report only** ("report on August from what we have", or a rewrite of the doc
  after a template change): steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; no labelers, every number comes
  from the store.

## Procedure

### 1. Clean (script)

```
node $S/clean.mjs <tweets.jsonl> --out <scratch>/clean.json [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--until YYYY-MM-DD]
```

Drops bot alert templates (`Route:`, `MIGRATION`, `CTO SIGNAL`, `WALLET FLOW CHECK`,
`Quick Buy`, `dm us`; extend with `--bot-pattern`), posts tagging ≥ 6 handles,
duplicates after stripping handles/urls, and texts under 8 chars. Prints raw/clean
counts, date range, account count, top authors, clean count by day, and what was
dropped. The raw→clean numbers go under the volume chart in the timeline section.

### 2. Timeline (script)

```
node $S/aggregate.mjs <clean.json> <scratch> --timeline [--since D] [--until D]
```

Prints the top 3 posts by likes for every day of the window — the raw material
of the timeline section. No keyword list: what users talk about comes from the
labels in step 3.

### 3. Label the posts that have no label yet

```
node $S/chunk.mjs <clean.json> --size 1500 --out <scratch> --labels docs/intel/x/<slug>/labels.jsonl [--since D] [--until D]
```

Only posts missing from `labels.jsonl` (and inside the window, if given) are
chunked; each chunk is written as `chunkN.json` and `chunkN.tsv` (one post per
line: id, author, likes, date, lang, text).

Write `<scratch>/app-facts.md` once: the app's official handles (current and
former), founder and team, products and features, competitors, and the noise
common in its mentions (referral spam, giveaway begging, bot alerts, user slang
such as chain nicknames). Nothing else: the field definitions and the vocabulary
come from the script.

**Default labeler: gpt-6-luna through `codex exec`**, driven by `run-labels.mjs` over a
bounded parallel pool (about 20 in flight). The rules, fields and answer schema come from
`$S/mentions-spec.mjs` (the default `--spec`; other skills pass their own spec to the same
scripts):

```
node $S/run-labels.mjs --facts <scratch>/app-facts.md --vocab docs/intel/x/vocab.json --out <scratch> <scratch>/chunk*.json
```

Each call runs in a private `CODEX_HOME` (the login copied, no user config,
AGENTS.md, plugins, hooks or tools), the labeling rules as the model's
instructions, the app facts, the eight field definitions with `vocab.json` as
examples and every post inline in the prompt, and the answer under a JSON schema
by post number (small models mistype 19-digit ids). The call defaults to the
**Fast service tier** (`service_tier = "priority"`: ~1.5x speed at 2x price, still
~1/10 the cost of gpt-6-sol; a labeling chunk is ~130k input tokens, well under the
272k short-context line, so it stays on the cheap tier); pass `--service-tier standard`
to opt out, and a model that does not advertise the tier silently downgrades. The script checks that every
post came back once and in order, writes `labelsN.json`, and prints
`chunk N: <posts> labeled, <noise%> noise, <about%> about; <tool calls>, <seconds>, <usage>`.
Each pass also logs to **stderr** `chunk N pass P/M: +<got>/<asked>, <left> left`, so a
chunk that early-stops (returns a valid but short answer, ~1 in 10 on 1500 posts) shows in
real time as a low `+got/asked` instead of a silent stall.

**Recovery is divide-and-conquer, not more same-size retries** (early-stop is stochastic
and size-independent — a fresh full-chunk resample fixes it, re-asking the same big chunk
just lengthens the tail). `run-labels.mjs` runs non-leaf chunks fail-fast
(`--max-passes 1`); when one fails it splits the posts ~3 ways and re-queues the parts in
parallel, recursing to a depth cap (1500 → ~500 → ~167). Independent parts rarely all
early-stop, and only the still-failing part recurses; leaf units (at the cap, which cannot
split) use full passes to mop up. Labels are keyed by post id, so parts merge cleanly, and
anything still unlabeled at the cap is printed with its ids. Measured (fast tier, effort
low): 167 posts ≈ 87s, 500 ≈ ~4 min, 1500 ≈ ~12 min (~0.5s/post); -P 20 over ~100 chunks
≈ ~1h. Higher effort made replies drop out and likes inflate, so keep effort low. Luna calls Sonnet's `noise` (content-free about=false posts)
`irrelevant` most of the time: the doc reports one about=false share, never the
split. Luna over-uses `mobile-app` as a feature for "I use the app": fold it with
`--rename` when it dominates.

**Fallback labeler: Sonnet subagents**, when the ChatGPT plan quota is out. Chunk
with `--size 2000`, spawn `general-purpose` Sonnet labelers, one chunk each, about
10 in flight; start the next when one finishes. Write the prompt once to
`<scratch>/PROMPT.md` (the app facts plus the field definitions below) and point
each labeler at it. The prompt says:

- First print all the posts, in batches of 100 as `id \t author \t likes \t date
  \t lang \t text`, into batch files under a private `work_N/` directory (never a
  shared one: labelers run side by side), then Read every batch file (the Read
  tool returns at most 25k tokens per call, Bash output about 30 KB, so reading
  is batched whatever the prompt says). After each batch, write that batch's
  labels as DATA — a file with one object per post id, the label the labeler
  decided while reading — never a classifier: no keyword rules, no regex, no
  function that derives labels from text. A final script only concatenates the
  batch data files, checks ids and order, and writes `labelsN.json`. (A prompt
  that asked for "one script holding all labels" made every labeler compress
  its judgments into regex rules, which is the keyword whitelist again; the
  per-batch data files are what keeps the labels per post.)
- Before merging, audit each `work_N/`: a `.py` there with `re.compile`,
  `re.search` or `in text`-style rules, or batch files whose ids add up to fewer
  than the chunk's posts, means that chunk was classified by rules — discard it
  and rerun that chunk.
- Then two files:
  - `labelsN.json`: one object per post, chunk order, every id present:
    `{id, about, sentiment, topic, feature, point, request, interest}`.
    - `about`: true only if the post is about the app itself (a reply that only
      carries the app's handle from the thread and talks about something else is
      false).
    - `sentiment`: for about=true, like / dislike / neutral / noise (noise: about
      the app but content-free, e.g. "gm @app"); for about=false, `irrelevant`
      (talks about something else: another token, a person in the thread) or
      `noise` (content-free: one-word replies, emoji, giveaway begging, bot
      alerts). The doc reports one about=false share for both.
    - `topic`: what the post is about as a subject people discuss (the event, the
      company, the ecosystem, the culture). The prompt lists the topics in
      `vocab.json` as examples (first run: product-features, outages-execution,
      fees-pricing, insiders-manipulation, scams-rugs, verification-listing,
      competition, funding-revenue-growth, chain-integrations, kols-celebrities,
      challenges-giveaways, token-communities, security-custody,
      regulation-regions, culture-memes, support-team) and says: if none fits,
      write your own. Never an `other` bucket.
    - `feature`: which part of the app the post is about; the prompt lists the
      features in `vocab.json` as examples (first run: fees, cross-chain-balance,
      copy-trading, leaderboard, thesis, clans, callouts, verification,
      limit-orders, mobile-app, web-app, ui, stability, custody-wallet, support,
      referral, apple-pay-onboarding, livestream, followers-social,
      chain-integration), and if none fits, write your own; `none` when no part of
      the app applies.
    - A topic or feature the labeler writes itself must be a 2–4 word English
      noun phrase, lowercase with hyphens, specific enough to tell apart from the
      examples, and reused for every post about the same thing (check the
      examples first, then your own earlier names).
    - `point`: ≤ 12 words saying what the post claims (the bug, the number, the
      complaint), never the feature name alone.
    - `request`: ≤ 12 words when the post asks to add, fix, change or remove
      something, else null.
    - `interest`: null when the speaker has no stake; otherwise the kind of
      stake, from the interests in `vocab.json` (first run: referral — posts a
      code or link; creator-rewards — earns callout / thesis rewards; token-team —
      promotes their own token; official-partner — the company, staff, partners;
      paid-promotion); write your own if none fits.
    Non-English posts are labeled like the rest, text fields in English. Topic ×
    sentiment gives the hot-topics section; feature × sentiment gives likes,
    dislikes and requests; `interest` gives the interested-party share.
  - `summaryN.txt` (plain text, not `.md`: the harness refuses subagent
    report-style markdown): sections LIKES, DISLIKES, REQUESTS with the top 5 points
    by post count, each with ids and one verbatim quote ≤ 25 words (Chinese posts
    quoted in Chinese, never spanning a t.co link), then FACTS: numbers, launches,
    outages, funding, partnerships, store removals, each with its id.
- Reply with one line: `chunk N: <posts> labeled, <noise%> noise, <about%> about`.

A 2000-post chunk is about 110k tokens of posts in and 70k of labels out, but a
labeler runs 40–70 tool turns and re-sends its context each turn: measured about
15M input tokens (roughly $5 at Sonnet prices, mostly cache reads) per 2000-post
chunk. Sonnet's window is 1M and its output cap 128k, so do not go above ~3000
posts per chunk; below 2000 the fixed 59k-token setup per agent dominates.

Both labelers write the same `labelsN.json` shape; the field definitions are the
same text (the script embeds them). Then fold the chunks into the store and grow
the vocabulary:

```
node $S/merge-labels.mjs docs/intel/x/<slug>/labels.jsonl <scratch> --vocab docs/intel/x/vocab.json [--rename topic:old=new ...]
```

It folds the chunk files into `labels.jsonl` by id (a relabeled id overwrites),
applies the aliases already in `vocab.json`, adds every new topic / feature / interest value that
reaches 1% of this batch's about=true posts to `vocab.json`, and prints the values below that line with their counts. Read the printed lists:
a new value that means the same as an existing one is folded with
`--rename topic:old=new` (field-scoped; the rename rewrites the store and is kept
as an alias so later runs fold it automatically); the rest stay in the labels but
not in the vocabulary. Commit `vocab.json` with the report: the next run, on any
app, seeds its prompt from it.

### 4. Aggregate and verify (script)

```
node $S/aggregate.mjs <clean.json> <scratch> --labels docs/intel/x/<slug>/labels.jsonl [--since D] [--until D] [--top 300]
```

Prints how many window posts have a label (re-run any chunk whose noise share is
far below the others: a labeler that marks one-line reply banter as neutral instead
of noise inflates "about" counts); topics with like / dislike / neutral counts and
the peak month of each; sentiment over all posts and over the top-liked
(volume share vs attention share); like, dislike and request counts per feature with
unique authors; the most frequent `point` and `request` texts; the interested-party
share of likes by kind of `interest`;
and, for every `summaryN.txt` present (Sonnet path only), unknown ids and quotes that are not a substring of any
post. Rank likes, dislikes and requests by their label counts; pick quotes from the top `point` texts (and the summaries when present). Take the final quote text by id from `clean.json`,
never from a labeler's paraphrase, and link it as
`https://x.com/<author>/status/<id>`.

### 5. Charts (script)

```
echo '{"out_dir":"docs/intel/x/<slug>/images","charts":[
  {"type":"bar","file":"<slug>-hot-topics.png","title":"热点话题（提及条数）","labels":[...],"values":[...],"color":"#2a78d6"},
  {"type":"daily","file":"<slug>-daily-volume.png","title":"每日提及量与当天事件","days":["09-02",...],"values":[...],"events":{"09-10":"App Store 下架"}},
  (a window longer than ~3 months uses months as days: `<slug>-monthly-volume.png`, "每月提及量与当月事件", "days":["2025-01",...])
  {"type":"bar","file":"<slug>-likes.png","title":"用户喜欢 App 的什么","labels":[...],"values":[...],"color":"#1baf7a"},
  {"type":"bar","file":"<slug>-dislikes.png","title":"用户不满 App 的什么","labels":[...],"values":[...],"color":"#eb6834"},
  {"type":"bar","file":"<slug>-requests.png","title":"用户想要什么","labels":[...],"values":[...],"color":"#8a5cd6"}
]}' | $S/render_charts.py /dev/stdin
```

Chinese labels, transparent background, dual-mode gray ink, title only. Event
labels on the daily chart sit horizontally above their day, staggered on three
levels with a leader line, so keep each event name short (about 8 characters) and
mark at most ten days. `$` in a label is matplotlib mathtext; escape it. Open each
PNG and check: no label collisions, headroom above the tallest bar.

### 6. Write `reception.md` (Chinese, concrete, evidence only)

```
# <App> 推特口碑（<start> → <end>）

## 一、概况
<three short paragraphs of prose, no bullets, no counts, no percentages, no window,
no method: an overview a reader skims before the findings>
<p1: what the app is, as the posts describe it — product, chains, how people use it>
<p2: in plain words, what people like about it, what they complain about, and the
one or two topics that dominate the conversation; the numbers live in 二–五>
<p3: the company's history as the posts tell it: funding, launches, user milestones>

## 二、热点在哪儿
![](images/<slug>-hot-topics.png)
1. <topic>: <count> 条, 好评 <n> / 差评 <n>, 峰值 <month>, <what the peak was about>
   > [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[verbatim text](url)

## 三、用户喜欢 App 的什么
![](images/<slug>-likes.png)
1. <feature or behavior>: <what exactly they praise>, <count> 条 / <authors> 人（say when the speakers are interested parties）
   > [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[verbatim text](url)

## 四、用户不满 App 的什么
![](images/<slug>-dislikes.png)
1. <feature or behavior>: <the specific bug, fee, delay, rule>, with the numbers users cite
   > [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[verbatim text](url)

## 五、用户想要什么
![](images/<slug>-requests.png)
1. <request>: add / fix / change what, <count> 条
   > [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[verbatim text](url)

## 六、时间线：声量、情绪、关键事件
![](images/<slug>-daily-volume.png)
- the scope in one line: the date range, the total posts, and the about=false (off-topic / noise) share — no cleaning or pipeline details
- MM-DD event, one line, with the number it moved
  > [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[verbatim text](url)
- how like/dislike share moved over the window (by month or quarter)
- facts worth keeping: funding, users, revenue, integrations, outages, store removals (id-linked)

## 七、对我们的启示
- one line per lesson, each tied to a finding above: what to copy, what to avoid, what users will ask us for

## TL;DR
- at most 5 bullets, plain words
```

Rules:
- No 方法 / 可信度 sections, no process narration, no agent or model talk, and no notes about
  removing bots / cleaning / filtering the data. It is a report on the app, not a record of what
  you did to the data — the reader wants the findings, not the pipeline.
- Quote line is exactly `> [@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)：[text](url)`: the handle is a link to
  the account, the text a link to the post; no like counts or any number next to the handle, no
  italics. Every quote line carries text. Chinese posts are quoted in Chinese.
- Any @handle in the prose is a link too: `[@handle](https://x.com/<handle>)`, so the reader can open it.
- Every claim in 二–七 names the feature, the bug, the number or the date. "故障 bug" or
  "骂战" is not a finding; "买入后 12 小时无法卖出，09-08 当天 41 条" is. 一 is the
  exception: prose without numbers.
- Charts sit at the top of their section.

### 7. Ship

`git add` `reception.md`, `images/` and `labels.jsonl` only, commit, push.
`clean.json`, the chunks, `labelsN.json` and `summaryN.txt` are scratch.

## Requirements

  CJK font at `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Arial Unicode.ttf`.

## Tests

```
node --test "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/analyze-x-mentions/tests/test_analyze_tweets.mjs"
```
