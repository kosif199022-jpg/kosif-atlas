# session-handoff

Preserve and restore session context across Claude Code sessions.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add jabworks/agentic-toolkit
```

Or install a specific plugin:

```
/plugin install session-handoff@agentic-toolkit
```

## Usage

**Save state:**
> "Save state" / "Handoff" / "Context is getting full"

Claude will gather git state, scaffold a handoff document from the template,
validate it, and save it to `.session-handoff/`.

**Resume:**
> "Resume from last session" / "Pick up from the handoff"

Claude will list available handoffs, check staleness against git history, and
walk through the resume checklist before touching any code.

## What gets captured

- Git branch, recent commits, modified files
- Stack snapshot (which services, migration state, router changes)
- Critical files with line references
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Ordered next steps (specific, not vague)

## Storage

Handoffs live in `.session-handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug].md` at the git
root and support chaining across long sessions. The directory is gitignored
working state — handoffs are disposable, and the skill offers to add the
ignore entry the first time it writes to a repo.
