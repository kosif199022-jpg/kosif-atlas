description: Creates and resumes handoff documents for seamless agentic coding session transitions.
when_to_use: "Trigger on \"wrap up\", \"wrap up this session\", \"save state\", \"handoff\", \"resume from handoff\", \"continue from last session\", \"clear handoffs\", \"prune handoffs\" — and when context approaches capacity (>80%), at natural pauses, or when switching workstreams. Wrap-up routes here even when a generic memory/remember skill is installed: the handoff document is the continuation artifact, and hook-based auto-memory still runs on its own. Not for resuming work on a design or plan artifact — that is discovery/draft-plan territory. Not for resuming an in-flight plan from the .condux/progress/ ledger — that is subagent-execution. Not for a usage/cost report — that is session-report. Not for remembering facts across Codex sessions — that is concord:remember."

# Session Handoff Skill

Preserve and restore session context across agentic coding sessions.

## Trigger conditions

**Create a handoff when:**
- User says "save state", "handoff", "wrap up", or "context is full"
- Context window approaching capacity (>80%)
- Logical milestone complete before switching workstreams
- Switching between workstreams or projects

**Resume from a handoff when:**
- User says "resume", "pick up from", or "continue from last session"
- Starting a session on a branch that has handoffs in `.session-handoff/`

## Create workflow

1. **Gather state** — run these inline:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git log --oneline -5
   git status --short
   git diff --name-only HEAD
   ls -lt .session-handoff/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
   ```
2. **Ask the user:** "Save handoff as **markdown** (.md), **HTML** (.html), or **both**? Default: markdown."
3. **Scaffold** using the chosen template — `references/handoff-template.md` or `references/handoff-template.html`. For **both**, fill the markdown template once, then mirror the same content into the HTML template — identical sections **in the same order**, no divergence. Both templates lead with "immediate next steps" and "blockers"; keep it that way, because a handoff is read to resume work. Fill every section — no `[FILL]` placeholders left.
   - **The HTML rail and the pane are two copies of the same steps.** Each rail entry is a clamped link (`href="#step-N"`) to the full text in the pane's `<ol class="steps">` (`id="step-N"`). Write the same wording in both, and when you add or remove a step keep every `href`/`id` pair aligned — a rail link with no matching id scrolls nowhere. Fill the rail's identity block from the frontmatter: task, created, branch, repo, workstream, continues-from.
   - **Set the rail's blockers chip to match the section.** Nothing stuck → `<a class="chip" href="#blockers">none</a>`; otherwise keep `class="chip blocked"`.
   - **Optional sections.** "decisions made", "blockers" and "deferred / out of scope" are legitimately optional — if a session has nothing to report there, replace that section's placeholder content with the one-line `.kit-empty` block shown in the HTML comment directly above it (a single `.kit-empty__body` sentence — this surface renders it as a quiet line, not a panel) instead of leaving stray placeholder rows. Delete that HTML comment once you have decided either way — it is scaffolding for you, and a saved handoff should not carry the instructions used to write it.
4. **Validate** before saving:
   - No `[FILL]` markers remain
   - No credentials, tokens, API key values, or env var values
   - Three required sections present and substantive (>50 chars each):
     "Current State Summary", "Important Context", "Immediate Next Steps"
   - Referenced file paths exist on disk
   - Next steps are specific (file:line, not "fix the auth")
   - **HTML only** — the rail agrees with the pane, because both are filled by hand:
     every `href="#step-N"` has a matching `id="step-N"` and the two carry the same
     text; the blockers chip says `none` exactly when the blockers section is empty;
     no authoring comment survives (the rail's fill note and the empty-state notes
     are scaffolding, not content)
5. **Save** to `.session-handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug].[md|html]`. For **both**, save the two files under the *same* `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug]` stem, differing only in extension.
6. Confirm: "Handoff saved: `.session-handoff/<filename>`" (list both paths when **both** was chosen)
7. **Retention check** — after saving, run the Prune workflow below on the remaining files: flag the new handoff's `continues-from` predecessor chain as superseded, plus anything very stale, and offer to delete them.

## Resume workflow

1. **List and pick** the relevant handoff:
   ```bash
   ls -lt .session-handoff/ | head -10
   ```
2. **Check freshness** relative to the handoff timestamp:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --after="<handoff-date>"
   git diff --name-only <handoff-branch>...HEAD
   ```
3. **Read** the full handoff document
4. **Run the resume checklist** at `references/resume-checklist.md`
5. **Report** staleness level and any red flags to the user before touching code
6. Begin at "Immediate Next Steps §1"
7. **After the resume has landed** (next steps under way or superseded by new direction), offer to delete the consumed handoff — and any older handoffs it chains to via `continues-from`. A resumed handoff is spent: its context now lives in the session and the next handoff.

## Prune workflow

Handoffs are disposable by design — once consumed or superseded, delete them.
Runs after a resume (step 7), after a create (step 7), or on request
("clear handoffs", "prune handoffs").

1. **Identify candidates** in `.session-handoff/`:
   - **Consumed** — resumed in this session and the work has moved on
   - **Superseded** — a newer handoff names it (directly or transitively) in `continues-from`
   - **Very stale** — >30 days old or >20 commits behind (see Staleness scoring)
   - **Overflow** — beyond the 5 most recent stems, oldest first
2. **Present the list** with one reason per file and ask for a single yes/no
   confirmation for the whole batch (the user can exclude items). Never delete
   without asking; never ask file-by-file.
3. **Delete** confirmed files with `rm`. Twin formats share a stem — always
   remove `.md` and `.html` together. If the file is tracked in git, use
   `git rm` so the deletion is staged.
4. Report what was removed and what was kept.

Never prune: the handoff just created, anything the user excluded, or the
only handoff for a branch with uncommitted work it describes.

## Staleness scoring

| Commits since | Age | Files changed | Level | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | <1 day | 0–5 | Fresh | Proceed |
| 1–5 | 1–7 days | 5–20 | Slightly stale | Note gaps, proceed |
| 6–20 | 7–30 days | 20+ | Stale | Surface delta, confirm |
| >20 | >30 days | — | Very stale | Reference only; re-explore first |

## Quality gates (block handoff if any fail)

- [ ] No `[FILL]` markers
- [ ] No secrets or credential values
- [ ] Required sections present and substantive
- [ ] Next steps include file paths and/or line numbers
- [ ] Each decision includes rationale, not just the choice

## Storage

`.session-handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug].md` and/or `.session-handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[slug].html`. When **both** formats are saved, they share one timestamp-slug stem and differ only in extension.

Handoffs are gitignored working state, not project docs — they're disposable
by design (see Prune workflow). The directory lives at the git root and is
created on demand. Before the first write in a repo, run the bootstrap once:

1. Resolve the root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Not a git repo →
   fall back to CWD and say so once.
2. `git check-ignore -q .session-handoff/` — already ignored, proceed silently.
3. Otherwise ask once: "Handoffs are scratch — add `.session-handoff/` to
   `.gitignore` so they stay out of your commits?" On yes, append it. If the
   user would rather not touch a tracked file, write it to
   `.git/info/exclude` instead. Never edit either file without asking.

Check `AGENTS.md` for a project-specific override; an explicit path wins.

**Migrating an existing repo:** older handoffs may sit in `handoffs/` at the
repo root (the pre-2.0 location) and may be committed. On resume, check both
paths. Offer to move them once — `git mv handoffs/ .session-handoff/` if
tracked, plain `mv` otherwise — but never move them silently.

If continuing prior work, set `continues-from` in the metadata header and reference the predecessor filename.
