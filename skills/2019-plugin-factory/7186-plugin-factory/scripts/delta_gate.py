"""Delta gate (winner #4) — score a skill by its LIFT over a baseline.

A skill is only worth shipping if a model *given the skill* beats the same model
without it (or the prior version of it). This gate reads a `benchmark.json` as
produced by the wrapped skill-creator's `aggregate_benchmark.py` and reports the
lift: with-skill pass rate minus baseline pass rate.

ADVISORY-ONLY FOR ONE RELEASE. The gate prints the delta and a would-block
verdict but always exits 0. Real benchmarks are noisy, and gating the repo on an
uncalibrated threshold would wall off good changes before we've watched the delta
behave on live data. Flip `MODE` to "blocking" only as a later, deliberate change
once the threshold has earned its keep. This lives in the aggregation + CI step,
never inside the per-run loop — gating a single noisy iteration would make the
loop thrash rather than converge.

Usage:
  delta_gate.py <benchmark.json> [--threshold FLOAT]
  delta_gate.py --self-test

The `benchmark.json` contract (confirmed against upstream aggregate_benchmark.py):
  run_summary:
    <skill-config>:    { pass_rate: { mean, stddev, min, max }, ... }
    <baseline-config>: { pass_rate: { mean, ... }, ... }
    delta:             { pass_rate: "+0.25" }   # primary - baseline, preformatted
Config names are discovered dynamically; skill configs contain with_skill/new_skill,
baselines contain without_skill/old_skill/no_skill/baseline. When the named configs
aren't both present we fall back to the preformatted `delta.pass_rate` string.
