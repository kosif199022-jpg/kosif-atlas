#
# scaffold-plugin.sh — deterministically generate a new marketplace plugin
# skeleton and wire it into the marketplace lockfile in one command.
#
# The whole point is that the mechanical, error-prone parts of adding a plugin —
# a valid plugin.json, a SKILL.md with real frontmatter, the AGENTS.md +
# CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md cross-harness symlinks, a command stub, and — critically —
# the marketplace.json entry — are produced identically every time, with NO
# unfilled {{placeholder}} tokens and NO timestamps or randomness. Determinism is
# what lets the plugin-factory dogfood its own output byte-for-byte in the cheap
# eval (see plugins/plugin-factory/evals/cheap/checks.sh).
#
# Two safety properties are baked in on purpose:
#   * Invariant-first (#3): SKILL.md leads with an "## Invariant" section, so the
#     author states what must ALWAYS/NEVER hold before writing any prose.
#   * Red-by-default (#13): the generated evals/cheap/checks.sh is a stub that
#     FAILS CLOSED — it carries an unguessable sentinel and calls bad(), so a
#     freshly scaffolded plugin cannot show green until a human replaces it with
#     real deterministic checks for that plugin's invariant.
#
# Usage:
#   scaffold-plugin.sh <name> [options]
#     --description TEXT   one-line plugin description (marketplace + manifest)
#     --author TEXT        author name (default: Jordan Richlen)
#     --invariant TEXT     the load-bearing "always/never" for this plugin
#     --root DIR           marketplace root (default: auto-detected repo root)
#     --force              overwrite an existing plugins/<name>/ directory
#
# Exit 0 on success; nonzero (with a message on stderr) on any refusal.

# --- the red-by-default sentinel -------------------------------------------

# literal below so it can write it into every red stub. evals/cheap/run.sh's
# sentinel scan skips any file carrying this SCAFFOLD-SENTINEL-SOURCE marker, so
# the generator itself is allowed to contain it while shipped stubs are not.

# SKILL.md — invariant-first (#3): the invariant leads, before any workflow prose.
#
# KNOWN SCAFFOLD-HYGIENE GAP (comment-only note, no behavior change — editing
# this heredoc's emitted text is a safety-path change under
# plugins/*/skills/**/scripts/** and needs its own reviewed PR): the
# "Use this skill whenever the user is working with $NAME." line and the
# "Write this first, before any workflow prose..." paragraph below are
# author-facing scaffold instructions, NOT runtime skill content, and MUST be
# deleted from the generated SKILL.md before a plugin ships. They have leaked
# into shipped plugins verbatim at least six times (context-handoff,
# codebase-design, diagnosing-bugs, tracer-bullets, docs-hygiene,
# semver-gate) because nothing here marks them as delete-before-ship. If you
# touch this heredoc, prefer wrapping both lines in an unmistakable marker
# (e.g. "SCAFFOLD-TODO: DELETE THIS LINE BEFORE SHIPPING") rather than
# leaving them looking like normal shipped prose.

# $NAME

## Invariant

$INVARIANT

Write this first, before any workflow prose. The invariant is what the cheap
eval defends; everything below exists to keep it true.

## When to use this

TODO: the contexts and user phrases that should trigger this skill.

## How it works

TODO: the workflow. Prefer portable prose and deterministic scripts over
harness-specific machinery so the skill works on any harness.
SKILL

# AGENTS.md — cross-harness entry point. Only references paths this scaffold
# actually creates, so the AGENTS.md real-path gate in run.sh stays green.
cat > "$PLUGIN_DIR/AGENTS.md" <<AGENTS
# AGENTS.md — $NAME

$DESC

## How to use it

Read \`skills/$NAME/SKILL.md\` and follow it — it is the authoritative
description of this plugin's workflow and the invariant it defends.

The command \`commands/$NAME.md\` is the entry point a user invokes.

## The invariant this plugin defends

$INVARIANT

The deterministic checks that defend it live in \`evals/cheap/checks.sh\` and run
as part of the marketplace cheap tier.
AGENTS

# Cross-harness symlinks so harnesses reading CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md find AGENTS.md.
( cd "$PLUGIN_DIR" && ln -sf AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md && ln -sf AGENTS.md GEMINI.md )

# README.md
cat > "$PLUGIN_DIR/README.md" <<README
# $NAME

$DESC

## Install

\`\`\`
/plugin marketplace add JRichlen/agent-plugins
/plugin install $NAME@jrichlen
\`\`\`

## Status

Freshly scaffolded. The cheap eval is intentionally RED until you replace
\`evals/cheap/checks.sh\` with real deterministic checks for this plugin's
invariant (see \`AGENTS.md\`).
