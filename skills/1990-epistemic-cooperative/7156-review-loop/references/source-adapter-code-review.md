# Claude Review Adapter

The host reference supplies isolation and invocation. This adapter maps the available
Claude `/code-review` implementation to the Source Interface in `SKILL.md`.

- At selection, reuse an available contract record matching the executable/version,
  selected skill implementation/version, and relevant configuration. Keep its exact
  command, accepted scope, output format, finding cap, reach channel, and evidence
  pointer on the trace for later invocations. Reuse capability evidence only; each
  call establishes its own authentication, reviewed scope, and completed result.
- When a record is absent or its identity changes, start with the host's read-only
  review invocation and determine the contract from its skill expansion and output.
  Mark unknown limits until observed; refresh the affected record fields when runtime
  evidence differs. A contract that cannot be established remains an explicit gap.
- Pass a designated effort level in the form the implementation parses, and read the
  level actually used from its expansion or output onto the trace. A call that ran at
  another level than designated, such as a remembered fallback, is a source mismatch
  under Phase 1.
- Establish that each review examined the requested local surface before normalizing
  it. A raw PR number alone addresses remote PR state and can omit local or stacked
  repairs.

Preserve the native result, then normalize only a completed review:

- A findings-array implementation: an explicit valid `[]` yields `approve`; a
  nonempty array yields `needs-attention`. Map file, line, summary, and failure
  scenario to findings, using behavioral consequence for severity rather than rank.
- A narrative implementation: extract its actual findings and explicit assessment.
  An explicit no-issues conclusion on the requested scope may yield `approve`.
- Skipped PRs, unavailable scope, blocked tools, malformed output, or no actual
  assessment contribute no completed review, even if no findings were returned.

Keep any explicit finding cap or scope exclusions in the source trade-off at entry
and residual at exit. In particular, Anthropic's public
[code-review plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/code-review/commands/code-review.md)
may have PR eligibility checks and an introduced-issues scope; it is not a universal
contract for every built-in bearing the name. If the implementation cannot honor
this invocation's local pointer, report the incompatibility instead of changing the
review target. Its posting options are separate from returning a review to this loop.

Request reach and direction where the implementation permits them. A fixed findings
array with no reporting fields has no such channel: declare that limit once at entry
and exit. Populate either slot only from what the reviewer actually returned; a
normalizer's guess is not source evidence. Leave direction empty when absent.
