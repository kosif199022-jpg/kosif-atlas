# Onboard Skill

Start with a quick recommendation based on recent sessions, then optionally continue to guided learning — so users experience value first, learn second.

Invoke directly with `/onboard` when the user wants onboarding or protocol discovery.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- A new user wants to discover which epistemic protocols fit their workflow
- A user wants to experience protocols through guided practice
- Re-onboarding after new protocols are added or workflow changes

Skip when:
- User already knows which protocol to use (direct invocation)
- Quick single-protocol question (answer directly)

## Workflow Overview

```
Quick Proof:    ENTRY → QUICKSCAN → PICK-1 → EVIDENCE → TRIAL → INSIGHT → NEXT
Targeted:       ENTRY → QUICKSCAN → MAP → SCENARIO → TRIAL → QUIZ → GUIDE
Targeted + std: ENTRY → SCENARIO → TRIAL → QUIZ → GUIDE

## Data Sources

Compact mapping for inline use.

| Protocol | Cluster | When to Use | Key Patterns |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Aitesis `/inquire` | Planning | A task rests on missing context or unchecked assumptions — collect what the AI can reach on its own, hand back what it cannot as the user's own unknown | Hand-off or execution about to start on context nobody gathered; implicit requirements, environment dependencies, prior decisions (for prior-session recall → use `/recollect`) |
| Euporia `/elicit` | Planning | Intent articulated but the decisions it turns on not yet named | Multi-axis intent without single axis-specific protocol fit; coordinates surface from the user's material, words, and the domain's usual decisions |
| Heuresis `/ideate` | Planning | Object-level candidate field is empty or has prematurely converged — widen it before any selection is made | Zero entry questions (seed vs. blank inferred from the utterance), frame-first mode on a blank entry, no elimination or ranking during generation, every candidate tagged `origin ∈ {User, AI}` |
| Proplasma `/preview` | Planning | Right before a direction commitment when the candidates cannot be judged from descriptions — contrast cheap discard-committed placeholder probes on AI-drafted axes relayed with their basis | Principle-delegation at direction gates ("go with the recommended direction"), option-set reconstruction instead of choosing, "I'd have to see it" decision stalls |
| Hypotyposis `/sketch` | Planning | A form has to be made, intent cannot yet be settled from descriptions, and the user would recognize it on sight — sketch under a settled focus, take marks on a specific version, revise the retained version, finish on the recognized one | "I'd know it when I see it", a plan stalled at its first draft, a description rewritten repeatedly instead of made |
| Analogia `/ground` | Analysis | Auditing what a mapping being relied on licenses about a case, reading any account it can reach as evidence | Intended conclusions whose structural evidence or limits remain uncertain |
| Periagoge `/induce` | Analysis | Concrete cases accumulating into an unnamed essence — crystallize the emerging abstraction | 2+ concrete cases with essence intuition but no located abstraction; `/ground` misfit where colimit is forced into substitution |
| Merismos `/apportion` | Execution | An autonomous goal is stated but its unit plan is uncompiled — cut it into coarse units at cited seams and close each unit before the run begins — a derived completion condition where one compiles, a recorded acceptance or a recorded reservation where none does | An unattended-run directive ("work through", "go through all", "run until done"), a goal that plainly exceeds one execution horizon, or a stop-hook being configured — each only shows an autonomous interval is *intended*, so the deciding check is whether the goal already carries units whose completion conditions are settled — closed by a determinate predicate, by a recorded acceptance, or by a recorded reservation; a plan that does is out of scope |
| Epharmoge `/contextualize` | Verification | A result — this session's or another's — is correct but may not fit where it lands or may leave out an intent the conversation stated | Misfits and omissions against everywhere the result lands and the session-built constraints, shown on one sheet |
| Elenchus `/sublate` | Verification | The working context about to be acted on — externalized or committed — may no longer hold: stale, weakly sourced, or contradicted | Dialectical antithesis per claim under test (provenance / counterfactual / cross-source consistency / inference) before action rests on it |
| Horismos `/bound` | Cross-cutting | Deciding what to delegate to AI | Provisional whole map, progressive examination, source-bound settlement and residual |
| Anamnesis `/recollect` | Cross-cutting | Resolving vague recall of prior sessions or discussions — one session, or a line of work, topic, or settled concept spread across several | Cross-session state recovery via narrative recognition (Recognition over Retrieval); a unit above one session is composed from its deposits at read time |
| Katalepsis `/grasp` | Cross-cutting | Rapid comprehension verification via intent-scented entry points | User-intent grasp for a target present in context and quotable, whoever produced it — reviews, plans, papers, docs, or code changes |
| Hyphegesis `/conduct` | Cross-cutting | Conducting the method of a multi-move work prospect before object-level cognition — order, independence, reconciliation, termination, routing | Multi-move work with non-trivial conduct (migrations, staged investigations, entangled adversarial/parallel/synthesis); "how should I approach this whole thing?" meta-questions |

## Phase Execution

Paths below written `{config_dir}/…` take `{config_dir}` = `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, else `~/.claude`. Resolve it ONCE per invocation with Bash `printf '%s\n' "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR-$HOME/.claude}"` and substitute the absolute result before any Read/Glob/Grep call.

### Phase 0: Entry (Path Selection)

Begin with a concise welcome and path selection, reserving the full catalog for the Browse-all path.

**Gate #1**:
- Text: Path selection prompt
- Options:
  - Quick recommendation (Recommended)
  - Learn a specific protocol
  - Browse all protocols

**If Quick recommendation**: set `path = quick`, proceed to Phase 1.

**If Browse all**: Present the protocol catalog (check installation status via Glob `{config_dir}/plugins/cache/epistemic-protocols/*/`, then render all core protocols from Data Sources as a numbered list grouped by Cluster with name + "When to Use" + installation badge). After catalog, present:
- Text: Post-catalog path selection
- Options:
  - Quick recommendation
  - Learn a specific protocol (type name in Other)

Then proceed based on selection.

**If Targeted + Other contains protocol name**: proceed directly to session source question.

**If Targeted + no protocol specified**:

Present a condensed catalog as text output: render the Data Sources table grouped by Cluster, each protocol as `/command — When to Use description`.

Then **Gate #2**:
- Text: Protocol selection (type name or number in Other)
- Options:
  - Pre-execution (Planning) — /inquire, /elicit, /ideate, /preview, /sketch
  - Analysis — /ground, /induce
  - Execution / Verification / Cross-cutting — /apportion, /contextualize, /sublate, /bound, /recollect, /conduct, /grasp

**Gate #3** (Targeted only, session source):
- Text: Session source selection
- Options:
  - Personalize with my recent sessions
  - Use standard examples (no session needed)

State after Phase 0:
- `path`: quick | targeted
- `target_protocol`: (targeted only) selected protocol name
- `session_source`: (targeted only) scan | standard — Quick path always runs Quick Scan

**Skip rule**: If targeted + standard → skip Phases 1-2, jump to Phase 3 with preset scenarios from `references/scenarios.md`.

### Phase 1: Quick Scan (User Context Profile) — Inline

Build a User Context Profile from the person's own opening turns in their recent Claude Code conversations. Runs inline (no subagent delegation). Both Quick and Targeted paths share this phase.

**Step 1: Collect recent opening turns**

- **Records**: Glob `{config_dir}/projects/*/*.jsonl` — a session record sits directly inside a project partition; anything nested deeper is a subordinate capture and is excluded by depth. Exclude partitions whose name contains `-worktrees-`, which hold delegated work rather than the person's own sessions. Take the ~10 most recently modified records.
- **Bounded head read**: read only the first 256 KB of each record (a byte-bounded read such as `head -c 262144 <record>`), never the whole file. Skip a line that does not parse — the last one may be cut by the bound.
- **Person turns only**: a line is the person's turn when its `type` is `user`, `isMeta` and `isCompactSummary` are both absent, and its text (`message.content` as a string, or the `text` parts of a content list — tool results are not text parts) neither opens with `<` nor is a bare control marker such as `[Request interrupted by user]`. Hook output, command wrappers, and injected envelopes arrive in the same `user` stream and are excluded by this rule.
- From each record keep its first 2-3 person turns. A record whose head holds none contributes nothing.

**Step 2: Infer User Context Profile**

From the collected turns, infer:
- **Work domains**: What areas the user works in (e.g., API development, infrastructure, data pipeline)
- **Conversation patterns**: Request clarity level, incremental vs. batch requests, question types (how/why/what)
- **Task types**: Ratio of feature development, debugging, refactoring, documentation

If no person turns were collected — a fresh install, or a host that keeps no such records: Quick path proceeds to Pick-1 with fallback (`/elicit`); Targeted path falls back to Onboarding Pool (`/elicit`, `/inquire`).

**Output for Phase 2**: User Context Profile (work domains, conversation patterns, task types). Quick Scan infers user context for protocol matching and scenario personalization.

### Phase 2a: Pick-1 (Quick Path — Single Recommendation)

**Quick path only.** Select exactly 1 protocol recommendation from the auto-recommend pool.

**Onboarding Pool**: `/elicit` (Euporia), `/inquire` (Aitesis). These two are chosen because users can quickly experience their value. Protocols like `/grasp` are user-initiated by nature and should not be proactively suggested in the first encounter.

**Recommendation rules** (applied to Quick Scan Profile):

| Protocol | Signal patterns | Priority |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| `/elicit` | Vague first prompts ("improve", "optimize", "make it better", "help me plan"); intent articulated but the decisions it turns on not yet named. An ideation ask ("ideas for", "brainstorm") routes to `/ideate` (Heuresis), which is user-initiated and therefore outside this proactive pool | Highest (also fallback) |
| `/inquire` | Hand-off or finalization language ("go ahead", "just do it", "ready", "ship", "merge") — the AI is about to execute on the context it has; tasks with implicit requirements or environment dependencies in summary. It checks what the imminent execution rests on (assumptions, missing facts, environment dependencies); it does not audit the decision for unconsidered trade-offs, alternatives, or omitted steps | Medium |

**Decision logic**:
1. Score each protocol by signal match count across the collected person turns
2. **Ideation route-away**: ideation asks ("ideas for", "brainstorm") score no pool protocol — when they are the only matched signals, relay in one sentence that the ask itself maps to `/ideate` (user-initiated: named as the route for that ask, not presented as the onboarding recommendation), then continue via the Fallback rule; the Phase 2b evidence card follows its fallback form, since the recommendation rests on the default, not on a matched signal
3. Select the single strongest match
4. Tie-break: `/elicit` > `/inquire`
5. **Fallback**: If no signals detected (no records, or too few person turns) — or every detected signal was routed away — recommend `/elicit`

**Output**: Present exactly one recommendation as a single sentence.

Format: Present as a single sentence stating which protocol is most likely to help right now.

### Phase 2b: Evidence (Quick Path — Evidence Card)

**Quick path only.** Present exactly 1 evidence card explaining why this recommendation was made.

**Evidence generation** (per protocol, referencing Data Sources table):
- Line 1: Cite the specific signal pattern from Quick Scan Profile that matched this protocol's "Key Patterns" column in Data Sources
- Line 2: State the expected benefit, derived from the protocol's "When to Use" column in Data Sources

Fallback (no session data): State that no patterns were detected, then cite the protocol's core value proposition from Data Sources "When to Use."

**Rules**:
- Evidence is maximum 2 lines — a focused cue.
- Do not show confidence scores or numbers.
- Do not quote session content verbatim.

After presenting evidence, present:
- Text: Trial invitation
- Options:
  - Try it now
  - Learn more about this recommendation
  - See a different recommendation
  - Go to full learning path

Branch: Try it now → Phase 4 (quick trial), Learn more about this recommendation → show Data Sources row for the recommended protocol then re-ask, See a different recommendation → pick next from pool and re-present from Phase 2a, Go to full learning path → set `path = targeted` and go to Phase 0 targeted flow.

### Phase 2: Map (Targeted Path — Protocol Matching)

**Targeted path only.** Apply User Context Profile to match protocols to the user's context.

1. Match Profile against the compact mapping table (Data Sources section). Select 2-3 protocols most relevant to the user's work domains and conversation patterns, defaulting to Onboarding Pool (`/elicit`, `/inquire`).
2. **Targeted sub-path**: Filter to target protocol, use Profile for scenario personalization. Note related protocols from the compact mapping table.
3. **Fallback**: If Profile quality is insufficient (no records, or too few person turns) → use **Onboarding Pool** (`/elicit`, `/inquire`). Proceed immediately without blocking the onboarding flow.

### Phase 3: Scenario (Targeted Path — Intervention Point)

**Targeted path only.** Present a concrete scenario showing where the protocol would have helped.

**Scenario construction** (2-tier fallback):
- **Tier 1** (User Context Profile available): Generate a hypothetical scenario grounded in the user's work context (domains, task types, conversation patterns from Quick Scan). Personalize standard scenarios from `references/scenarios.md` using Profile data.
- **Tier 2** (no data / Onboarding Pool fallback): Use preset scenarios directly from `references/scenarios.md`.

Present scenarios for each of the top 2-3 protocols sequentially.

**Scenario format**:

```
Scenario: /X (Protocol Name)

[Situation]: [Concrete situation grounded in user's work context — or preset from scenarios.md]

[Intervention]: If you had called /X at this point:
- [what the protocol would have done — step 1]
- [step 2]
Expected outcome: [e.g., reduced rework, clearer direction]
```

**Clarity rule**: Scenarios must present **clear-cut** protocol fits where the mapping is unambiguous. If a situation could plausibly map to multiple protocols (e.g., "exploration" could be `/elicit` or `/ideate`), reserve it for Phase 5 quiz material instead of using it as a scenario. The scenario phase builds confidence through recognition; the quiz phase builds discrimination through ambiguity.

**Anti-pattern**: Scenarios must be self-contained (situation + intervention) with unambiguous protocol fit. Ambiguous patterns belong in Phase 5 quiz.

Present each scenario as regular text output (Tier 1/2 format above). Then present for navigation only:

**Gate** (per scenario):
- Text: Scenario navigation
- Options:
  - Try it — practice this protocol
  - Show another example
  - Skip to quiz

### Phase 4: Trial (Protocol Execution)

Guide the user through a real, abbreviated protocol experience.

#### Quick Path Trial

**Mini practice prompt**: Present a single realistic request (one sentence) that naturally triggers the selected protocol's deficit. When User Context Profile is available, adapt the domain to match the user's work context. Source from `references/scenarios.md` Trial prompt field, or generate from Data Sources context. Follow with gate interaction:
- Text: Trial scenario confirmation (user can also define their own)
- Options:
  - Start with this scenario — call /X
  - Start with my own scenario (type in Other)

**Execution**: The user invokes the actual protocol (e.g., type `/elicit`). The protocol runs in the same session with the mini prompt as context. Trial ends when the invoked protocol reaches its natural termination. After protocol termination, proceed to **Quick Post-Trial** below.

**Quick Post-Trial Insight** (2 lines max):

Generate from the protocol just experienced:
- Line 1: Name the epistemic operation performed (source: protocol's deficit → resolution type, or `references/scenarios.md` Philosophy field)
- Line 2: Connect to a concrete workflow benefit

**Epistemic Ink Tip** (1 line, after Post-Trial Insight): "Tip: Run `/config` to enable Epistemic Ink — an Output Style that enhances protocol interactions with structured formatting."

**Quick Post-Trial Navigation**:

Present via gate interaction:
- Text: Post-trial navigation
- Options:
  - That's enough for today
  - Try a different protocol
  - Continue to full onboarding

Branch: That's enough for today → end session with brief closing, Try a different protocol → check pool exhaustion: if unrecommended protocols remain in Onboarding Pool, pick next and restart from Phase 2a; if pool exhausted (every pool protocol recommended in session), present You've experienced all core recommendations and offer Targeted transition, Continue to full onboarding → set `path = targeted` and go to Phase 2 MAP with Quick Scan results.

#### Targeted Path Trial

"Try it" selection from Phase 3 already signals intent — enter trial directly without additional confirmation.

**Mini practice prompts** (scoped for 2-3 exchanges): Use the **Trial prompt** field from `references/scenarios.md` for the target protocol. Present the trial guidance as regular text output.

**Execution**: Prompt the user to invoke the actual protocol (e.g., type `/inquire`). The protocol runs in the same session with the mini prompt as context. Trial ends when the invoked protocol reaches its natural termination. After protocol termination, present Post-Trial Insight and LOOP.

Offer trial for the top-recommended protocol first. If user completes it, optionally offer trial for the second recommendation.

**Post-Trial Insight** (presented after trial completion):

After each trial, present a brief insight card sourced from the **Philosophy** field in `references/scenarios.md`. Structure:

```
Protocol Insight: /X (Greek name)

[Core principle — one sentence]
[Workflow position — where this protocol sits and why]
[Game feel — the experiential pattern you just went through]
```

**Post-Trial LOOP**:

After the Post-Trial Insight, present:
- Text: Post-trial navigation
- Options:
  - Quiz — test my understanding
  - Another scenario — see more examples
  - Try a different protocol
  - Guide — see my learning summary

Branch: Quiz → Phase 5, Another scenario → Phase 3, Different protocol → Phase 3 with next MAP protocol or Phase 0 with cached MAP, Guide → Phase 6.

### Phase 5: Quiz (Socratic Verification)

Test protocol recognition through situation-based questions. Question format differs by path.

**Question sourcing** (in priority order):
1. **Ambiguous scenarios from Phase 3 filtering** — situations that were too ambiguous for scenarios are ideal quiz material (e.g., "exploration" that could be `/elicit` or `/ideate`)
2. Protocols from TRIAL + MAP results (personalized)
3. Profile-personalized variants of preset scenarios (if User Context Profile available)
4. Preset scenarios from `references/scenarios.md`

#### Targeted Path

**Type 1 — Binary recognition** (2-3 questions):

Present via gate interaction for each:
- Text: Present a situation (2-3 sentences), ask "Is this a `/X` situation?"
- Options: "Yes" / "No"
- Mix: 1-2 true positives + 1 true negative (situation that fits a neighbor protocol)
- On "No" answer for a true negative: briefly introduce the correct protocol as a natural distinction point

**Type 2 — Reverse recognition** (1 question):

Present via gate interaction:
- Text: Present 3 short scenarios numbered 1-3, ask "Which of these are `/X` situations?"
- Options: "1 and 2" / "2 and 3" / "1 and 3" / "All three"

**Type 3 — Design thinking** (1 question):

Present via gate interaction:
- Text: Present a situation, ask "How would you formulate your request to AI to avoid this problem?"
- Options: "Show me a hint" / "Show me a model answer"
- The user's primary input channel is Other (free text). Evaluate based on whether the response demonstrates protocol awareness.

#### Multi-Protocol Path

Applies when the targeted flow was entered from the Quick path ("Continue to full onboarding", or the pool-exhausted transition) without a single target protocol, so MAP selected 2-3 protocols.

**Type 1 — Situation recognition** (3-4 questions):

Present via gate interaction for each:
- Text: Present a situation (2-3 sentences), ask "Which protocol fits?"
- Options: 4 protocol choices (correct answer + 3 plausible distractors)

**Type 2 — Design thinking** (1 question):

Same format as Targeted Path Type 3.

#### Feedback (both paths)

Immediate feedback after each question:
- **Correct**: Reinforce with the core principle + why the distinction matters. "Correct — `/inquire` collects what the AI can reach on its own and hands back what remains as the user's own unknown (what can I reach, and what is yours?), while `/apportion` cuts an autonomous goal into coarse units at cited seams and closes each unit before the run begins. `/inquire` exhausts the context the AI can reach and names what only the user holds (context sufficiency), `/apportion` gives the run a closed unit each — a checkable finish line where one compiles, a recorded acceptance or a recorded reservation where none does (execution structure)."
- **Incorrect** (reasoning inquiry → targeted correction):
  1. **Reasoning inquiry**: Present via gate interaction 2-3 reasoning hypotheses inferred from the user's wrong answer (context-specific, not templates). Do not reveal the correct answer. "Other" always available.
  2. **Targeted correction**: Using the user's stated reasoning, explain the distinction through the design axis that separates the confused pair. Directly address the reasoning — e.g., "You mentioned timing — that's the right axis. The key difference is the *object*: `/inquire` works before a result exists, on what the AI lacks — collecting what it can reach and handing back the user's unknowns — while `/contextualize` works after, on whether the result fits its context."
  3. **Resume**: Proceed to next question.

  **Reasoning inquiry cap**: Apply reasoning inquiry for the first 2 incorrect answers per quiz session. Subsequent incorrect answers receive direct targeted correction (step 2 only) without the reasoning inquiry step.

**Distinction depth**: Quiz feedback should go beyond "A, not B" to explain the *design dimension* that separates confused pairs. Reference the distractor pairs from Quiz Design section. The goal is that even wrong answers teach — the user leaves understanding *why* two protocols that sound similar serve different purposes.

### Phase 6: Guide (Summary + Next Steps)

Summarize the learning experience, connect it to the broader epistemic workflow, and provide actionable next steps.

1. **Learning summary**:
   - Protocols experienced (trial) and tested (quiz)
   - Quiz accuracy + key distinctions learned
   - Personalized strength: "You naturally recognize [pattern] — `/X` formalizes this"

2. **Epistemic Map** (connect the dots):

   Present the Epistemic Concern Clusters from `references/workflow.md`. Highlight protocols the user experienced with emphasis (e.g., bold or `★`).

3. **Next protocol suggestion**: Based on quiz results and MAP data, suggest the next protocol to explore — preferring related protocols in the same cluster.

4. **Advanced Usage** (bonus tips after main guide):

   Present 3-5 tips from `references/advanced-usage.md` (declared protocol chains, multi-protocol sessions, invocation techniques, etc.), prioritizing tips related to protocols from TRIAL and QUIZ — a declared chain that touches a protocol they experienced comes first.

5. **Continue exploring** (when MAP results contain unexplored protocols):

   Present via gate interaction:
   - Text: "Want to experience another protocol?"
   - Options: "Yes — show me another" / "Done — I have enough"

   If "Yes" → return to Phase 3, using the next recommended protocol from MAP results.

## Quiz Design

**Difficulty progression**: Start with high-contrast pairs (e.g., `/elicit` vs `/apportion`), progress to subtle distinctions (e.g., `/elicit` vs `/inquire`, `/inquire` vs `/contextualize`).

**Distractor selection**: Choose protocols that share surface similarity with the correct answer:
- `/elicit` ↔ `/inquire`: both about "unclear starting point" but different layers — Aitesis collects the facts the AI can reach and hands back what only the user holds (information layer), Euporia surfaces the decisions the user's intent turns on (coordinate-explication layer)
- `/inquire` ↔ `/apportion`: both run right before the AI acts, but `/inquire` collects the context the action rests on as far as the AI can reach and names the rest as the user's unknown, `/apportion` cuts an autonomous goal into coarse units and closes each one — on a compiled completion predicate, on an acceptance you recorded when none compiles, or on a reservation where a judgment rather than a check settles it — before an autonomous run
- `/inquire` ↔ `/contextualize`: both about "context" but different timing (pre vs. post execution)
- `/bound` ↔ `/inquire`: both pre-execution and AI-directed, but different targets (ownership boundaries vs. missing context)

**Path-specific question counts**:
- **Targeted**: 2-3 binary + 1 reverse + 1 design = 4-5 questions
- **Multi-protocol**: 3-4 situation + 1 design = 4-5 questions

## Gate Interaction Budget

Quick path targets 3-4 calls. Targeted path targets 6-12 calls.

| Phase | Calls (Quick) | Calls (Targeted) | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| 0. Entry | 1-2 | 2-3 | Path + protocol + session source |
| 2b. Evidence | 1 | — | Trial confirmation |
| 3. Scenario | — | 1-2 | Navigation after scenario text |
| 4. Trial | 1 | 0 | Quick: situation choice. Targeted: direct entry |
| 4→Q. Next | 1 | — | Quick: post-trial navigation |
| 4→5 LOOP | — | 1 | Targeted: post-trial navigation |
| 5. Quiz | — | 4-7 | MC/design or binary/reverse/design + reasoning inquiry |
| 6. Guide | — | 0-1 | Optional continue exploring |

## Rules

1. **Value before learning**: Quick path proves value in under 3 minutes. Learning (scenarios, quizzes) is available but not the default entry.
2. **One at a time**: Quick path shows exactly 1 recommendation, 1 evidence card, 1 trial.
3. **Onboarding Pool**: `/elicit`, `/inquire` are the unified recommendation set for both Quick path auto-recommend and Targeted path fallback. User-initiated protocols (`/grasp`, `/apportion`) and specialized protocols (`/contextualize`) are excluded. When pool is exhausted in Quick path, transition to Targeted path.
4. **Experience over analysis**: This skill teaches through doing; its output is the trial and the terminal summary.
5. **Privacy**: Never transmit session data externally. All analysis runs locally.
6. **No subagent delegation**: Both Quick and Targeted paths use inline Quick Scan.
7. **Trial authenticity**: Trial phase must execute the actual protocol, not simulate it. The user invokes the real slash command.
8. **Immediate feedback**: Quiz answers get instant feedback. For incorrect answers, reasoning inquiry precedes correction (per Feedback section). Never batch quiz results.
9. **No auto-install**: Guide installation but never install plugins automatically.
10. **Session record access**: Read a conversation record only through a byte-bounded head read, never the whole file, and keep only the person's turns as Phase 1 defines them. Assistant turns, tool output, and injected text are not read into the profile.
11. **Preset as safety net**: `references/scenarios.md` ensures every user gets a complete experience regardless of session history availability.
12. **Single session**: The entire onboarding completes in one session. No cross-session state required.
