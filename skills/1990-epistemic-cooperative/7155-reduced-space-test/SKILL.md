# Reduced-Space Test: Scoped Empirical Validation

Validate an inference-uncertain proposition inside a constraint-bounded stand-in space synchronized with the user, obtain a scoped resolution ("within these conditions, whether it holds, fails, or remains inconclusive"), and carry the uncovered complement forward to a follow-up protocol. This skill does not run the experiment substrate, open branches, or create PRs. It orchestrates existing protocols around one disciplined empirical move.

**This is an orchestration utility, not a runtime executor and not a new epistemic protocol.** Reduced-Space Test introduces no new interaction deficit. It realizes a known composite — decompose the target↔surrogate equivalence claim into verifiable facets, then project `/bound`'s source-grounded result into a synchronized test space and coverage complement ∘ `/inquire` for evidence inside it → scoped resolution + carried complement. It is a thin composition over existing protocols, kept outside the core protocol set because it owns no deficit of its own.

The core recognition act is **decomposing the equivalence claim into verifiable facets** — not "creating a reduced space." A stand-in space is only as good as the facets on which it is claimed equivalent to the target; the value lives in making those facets explicit and observable.

## Core Contract

`/reduced-space-test` owns scoped empirical validation:

```
InferenceUncertainClaim
  -> ScopedClaimFrame       (core: decompose target↔surrogate equivalence into verifiable facets)
  -> /bound outcome        (an applicable DefinedBoundary proceeds; other exits keep what they left — a withdrawal's record, or a gate still holding — under Phase 2)
  -> recognition of the undrawn cut   (the user draws every part of the cut no act of theirs drew)
  -> BoundedTestSpace       (applicable result projected into settled test scope, coverage complement, and pending boundary obligations)
  -> EmpiricalEvidence      (/inquire: observe inside the bounded space, evidence over inference)
  -> ScopedResolution | CoverageShortfall   (carry the scope record, including pending boundary obligations; scoped outcome — holds, fails, or inconclusive — within the claim's defined conditions; or, on under-coverage, a CoverageShortfall: slice-scoped resolution or no resolution, with the remainder re-bounded or carried)
  -> Residual               (uncovered complement -> follow-up protocol)
```

An empirical terminal pairs a **scoped result** (`ScopedResolution` or `CoverageShortfall`) with a **carried residual**: the supported outcome or explicit shortfall, paired with the coverage complement. The scoped result retains its scope record, including still-pending boundary obligations with their sources and next treatment; these obligations remain distinct from coverage. A `/bound` run that ends without an applicable `DefinedBoundary` follows Phase 2 and supplies no successful validation result.

## Types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `InferenceUncertainClaim` | A proposition about behavior, performance, transfer, or value that inference alone cannot settle and that the user wants grounded in evidence. |
| `EquivalenceClaim` | The asserted target-environment ↔ surrogate-space equivalence the test rests on. The test is only valid on the facets where this equivalence is itself examined. |
| `VerifiableFacet` | One decomposed, observable dimension of the equivalence claim — a place where target and surrogate can be compared and a gap measured. |
| `ScopedClaimFrame` | The Phase 1 output: the decomposed set of `VerifiableFacet`s the test will and will not speak to — critical facets, the surrogate↔target difference inventory, influence-path hypotheses, and the chosen gap-measurement approach. Surfaced for user recognition before it constrains the boundary; it is what keeps the later evidence sentence honest. |
| `BoundedTestSpace` | The validation scope projected from `/bound`'s source-grounded entries and the `ScopedClaimFrame`, paired with its coverage complement. Its scope record binds the settled conditions to their sources and retains pending boundary obligations with their required next treatment; the settled scope constitutes the verifiable claim. |
| `Residual` | The complement the bounded space does not cover. A first-class output, carried forward, never dropped. |
| `EmpiricalEvidence` | Observation captured inside the bounded test space through `/inquire` — evidence with cited basis, scoped to the conditions actually exercised. |
| `ScopedResolution` | The scoped outcome within the bounded space on the tested facets: the proposition holds, fails, or remains inconclusive — stated as an updated failure probability within the defined conditions (lower on confirmation, higher on disconfirmation), never a bare "it works". Its scope record carries still-pending boundary obligations and their sources/next treatment. A disconfirming or inconclusive result is a first-class resolution, not a loop failure. |
| `CoverageShortfall` | The typed outcome when the bounded space turns out narrower than the claim it must license (under-coverage): no `ScopedResolution` is issued for the full claim; the honest exit re-scopes the resolution to the slice actually covered (resolution over the slice + the uncovered remainder carried as `Residual`) or re-bounds the space (→ Phase 2). Preserve the scope record with pending obligations even when the result states no resolution. A bounded exit, never an implicit retry. |

## Composition

Reduced-Space Test orchestrates existing protocols; most per-step work is delegated to them, while this skill owns the Phase 1 facet decomposition outright, plus the sequencing and the scoping discipline across the protocols it composes.

```
(conditional front) /elicit | /induce                              Phase 0
   -> decompose equivalence claim into facets [owned: ScopedClaimFrame]  Phase 1
   -> /bound      [applicable DefinedBoundary, or another actual exit]  Phase 2
   -> recognize the cut the user did not draw                         Phase 2, before projection
   -> project scope, coverage complement, and pending obligations     Phase 2, only with the applicable result
   -> /inquire    [ContextInsufficient -> SufficientContext, Observe]  Phase 3
   -> residual carry-forward (/inquire | /elicit)                      Phase 4
```

- On an actually emitted, applicable `DefinedBoundary`, project the validation scope and its coverage complement from the current boundary entries, their setting record, and the `ScopedClaimFrame`. An item in the boundary's residual can be pending work inside the scope; an established exclusion can belong to the coverage complement with no unsettled judgment. Preserve this distinction when composing the result.
- At the `/inquire` handoff, pass the settled scope, conditions, and source-grounded pending obligations that bear on the observation. Its scope-covers-claim discipline governs what the evidence can support.

## Phase 0: Intake + Name the Pattern (conditional)

Read the `InferenceUncertainClaim`: the proposition the user cannot settle by reasoning alone, and why evidence in a stand-in space is wanted.

Front with a crystallization step only when the test intent is genuinely under-formed:

- If the test intent is aporetic — the user senses an unknown but cannot yet state the proposition — front with `/elicit` (Euporia) to surface it.
- If the test pattern recurs but is unnamed — the same stand-in-validation shape appears across cases without a handle — front with `/induce` (Periagoge) to crystallize it.

When the proposition is already stated and the pattern is familiar, proceed directly to Phase 1. The front step is a conditional affordance, not a mandatory gate.

## Phase 1: Decompose the Equivalence Claim into Facets

This is the core act. The test rests on an `EquivalenceClaim` — that the surrogate space stands in for the target on the dimensions that matter. Make that claim observable:

- **Surface critical facets**: the dimensions on which the proposition's truth in the target depends (behavior, load, distribution, configuration, value).
- **Inventory surrogate↔target differences**: where the stand-in space diverges from the target, named rather than assumed away.
- **Hypothesize influence paths**: how each difference could change the outcome, so the test targets the differences that matter.
- **Choose a gap-measurement approach**: the means by which the surrogate-to-target gap is observed (for example randomization across conditions, shadowing live input, or a staged canary), selected for the facets in play.

The output is a `ScopedClaimFrame`: the facets that the test will and will not speak to. This frame is what keeps the later evidence sentence honest.

**Surface the frame for recognition before it constrains the boundary.** The facet set is an AI-formed hypothesis, not a settled determination — present it to the user as a structured, recognizable set (the critical facets, the surrogate↔target differences, and what is deliberately out of frame), with an explicit Emergent probe: *is any decision-relevant facet missing, and are these the dimensions that actually matter?* The user confirms, extends, or reweights the frame. Because the facet decomposition is the act that shapes where the test's attention goes — and that frame licenses every later claim — letting the AI fix it silently would inject attention bias at the root; surfacing it for recognition keeps the choice of which facets count with the user.

## Phase 2: Bound the Test Space (compose /bound)

Compose `/bound` (Horismos: `BoundaryUndefined -> DefinedBoundary`) to define the validation boundary with the user, then derive `BoundedTestSpace` only from an actually emitted `DefinedBoundary` applicable to this claim. A `/bound` this utility composes is an explicit invocation.

**Constraint sync is a Constitution interaction.** The user defines the reduced space, and that definition *constitutes the verifiable claim* — testing "does the API respond" and testing "does the API sustain its rated throughput" are different reduced spaces that license different claims. The boundary the user draws is therefore not a mechanical narrowing; it determines what the eventual resolution is allowed to assert. Surface the facet frame from Phase 1 so the user draws the boundary in recognition of what each cut includes and excludes.

- Before projecting, present for the user's recognition every part of the cut they did not draw themselves — in their own words, by selecting or accepting what they were shown, or by an earlier decision of theirs, however `/bound` cites it. What observation returned draws nothing, and neither does a choice the AI made inside a grant. Show what each side includes and excludes; the user's answer draws it, and nothing is projected from that part alone.
- When an applicable `DefinedBoundary` has been emitted, read its map and setting record to resolve the actual included conditions and exclusions against the `ScopedClaimFrame`. Project the included conditions into the test scope and the uncovered facets into this utility's `Residual`; cite the source of each cut.
- When `/bound` ends without an applicable `DefinedBoundary`, preserve what it left — a withdrawal's record (the snapshot at the user's word, and the boundary that last stood, if any), or a gate still holding (its context, from which its map is read) — with its sources, limits, and open decisions. Respect the actual exit and the user's instruction: a withdrawal ends the withdrawn composition, a continuation the user names follows its stated reach, and an unanswered boundary judgment holds dependent validation. Neither an empty successful boundary nor an automatic restart is supplied by the exit. Resume projection only when an actual applicable result is available. Where a boundary already projected reopens — `/bound` holds again, keeping the boundary that last stood — dependent validation waits on the reopened items and resumes from the boundary when it stands again; evidence already observed inside still-settled conditions stays evidence of those conditions.
- When the emitted boundary carries unresolved material, retain it in `BoundedTestSpace` with the next treatment each open item of the boundary's residual names — who settles it under its governing arrangement, and why it bears — reading its dependencies from the map. Distinguish a pending in-scope selection or prerequisite from an uncovered facet; copying the entire boundary residual as the coverage complement loses that distinction.
- Before empirical work depends on an unsettled scope value or prerequisite, resolve it through its source-defined disposition or return to the affected `/bound` judgment in Phase 2. Continue independent authorized observation only within already-settled conditions. Carry still-pending obligations in the final scoped result's scope record, with sources and required next treatment.

## Phase 3: Capture Empirical Evidence (compose /inquire)

Compose `/inquire` (Aitesis: `ContextInsufficient -> SufficientContext`) to observe inside the `BoundedTestSpace` and settle the scoped uncertainty (confirm, disconfirm, or find it inconclusive).

- Read the projected scope and pending obligations before observation; satisfy the dependencies of the observation under their setting sources.
- Capture observation evidence in the bounded space — evidence over inference, with cited basis.
- Hold the scope-covers-claim discipline: the space actually exercised must cover the claim the evidence will license. Evidence drawn from a narrower slice than the claim it is asked to support is under-covering and does not yield a `ScopedResolution`.

The output is `EmpiricalEvidence` plus a `ScopedResolution` retaining the `BoundedTestSpace` scope record and recording the outcome — confirming, disconfirming, or inconclusive — for the bounded space. Under-coverage (evidence drawn from a slice narrower than the claim) is the one case that yields no `ScopedResolution` for the full claim — its typed exit is a `CoverageShortfall`: re-scope the resolution to the slice actually covered (resolution over the slice + the uncovered remainder carried as `Residual`) or re-bound the space (→ Phase 2). A disconfirming result, by contrast, is a resolution, not its absence. Both empirical terminal forms carry the scope record and its still-pending obligations; explicitly state when none remain.

## Phase 4: Scope the Claim + Carry the Residual Forward

Restrict the resolution to the conditions actually tested, and route the complement onward.

- **Scope the claim**: state the resolution as an updated failure probability within the defined conditions — reduced where the evidence confirmed, raised where it disconfirmed, left open where it was inconclusive. An absolute assertion in either direction ("it behaves identically" / "it is broken") exceeds what any stand-in space can support and is set aside in favor of the scoped form.
- **Carry the residual forward**: route the `Residual` to a follow-up protocol — `/inquire` to gather more before a next decision, or `/elicit` to crystallize what the uncovered region still leaves open. The carry-forward is explicit output, recorded so a later session re-enters the uncovered region without re-deriving it.

At empirical convergence, present the pairing: the scoped resolution with its scope record, and the coverage residual with its routing. Beside the tested conditions, show still-pending boundary obligations, their sources, and required next treatment, or explicitly state none. When the run ends in a `CoverageShortfall`, the pairing is the slice-scoped resolution (or an explicit no-resolution where no slice was covered) together with the uncovered claim-remainder as residual — the under-coverage path converges through the same pairing, never as a silent retry. The shortfall record retains pending boundary obligations even when no slice-scoped resolution exists. A receiving follow-up reads the result's scope record before relying on the outcome: resolve prerequisites bearing on its proposed action through their actual authority, and preserve other pending obligations without treating them as untested facets. This pairing states the test's reach and what remains necessary for later reliance.

## Rules

1. **Facet decomposition is the core act** (orchestration identity): The test's value is the explicit decomposition of the target↔surrogate equivalence into verifiable facets, not the construction of a stand-in space. A reduced space presented without its facet frame is an untested equivalence assumption wearing the appearance of evidence. The decomposed frame is surfaced for user recognition — with an Emergent probe for missing facets — before it constrains the boundary, so which facets count is never a silent AI determination.
2. **Constraint sync is Constitution** (authority boundary): The user defines the bounded space, and that definition constitutes the verifiable claim. The skill surfaces the facet frame and the boundary's includes/excludes; the user draws the cut.
3. **Scoped claim only** (evidence discipline): Resolution sentences assert an updated failure probability within the defined conditions — lower on confirmation, higher on disconfirmation, open on inconclusive. Absolute claims in either direction exceed what a stand-in space supports and are reframed to the scoped form. A disconfirming or inconclusive result is a first-class resolution, never suppressed to force a confirmation.
4. **Residual carries forward** (completeness): Derive the uncovered complement from the settled test scope and facet frame, and route it to a follow-up protocol. Preserve pending boundary obligations in the scoped result's record through final presentation and downstream use, distinct from the coverage complement; dependent observation waits until its scope and prerequisites are settled.
5. **Scope covers claim** (coverage): The bounded test space must cover the claim it licenses. Evidence from a slice narrower than its claim is under-covering: it yields no scoped resolution for the full claim and exits as a `CoverageShortfall` — re-scope to the covered slice (resolution over the slice + remainder as residual) or re-bound — never an implicit retry.
6. **Compose, do not reinvent** (cost discipline): Reduced-Space Test orchestrates `/bound` and `/inquire` (with a conditional `/elicit` or `/induce` front). Project only an actually emitted, applicable `DefinedBoundary`; otherwise preserve what the actual exit left and follow that exit and the user's instruction. It introduces no new interaction deficit and does not constitute a new protocol.

## Boundary Note

`/reduced-space-test` sequences existing protocols and holds the scoping discipline across them. It reads the user's proposition and emits a scoped resolution plus a carried residual; it does not run the experiment substrate, provision environments, or enforce gate passage that belongs to a harness. Domain-specific facet templates (for data, software, or infrastructure stand-in spaces) are a deferred extension — the present contract is domain-free and decomposes facets per claim rather than from a fixed template.

## Anti-patterns

- **Absolute-claim leak**: asserting "it behaves identically" or "it is the same" from stand-in evidence. The claim must be scoped to the tested conditions; absolutes are not defensible from a reduced space.
- **Surrogate without difference inventory**: bounding a test space without naming where it diverges from the target. The unnamed differences are exactly where the scoped resolution silently fails.
- **Residual drop**: presenting the scoped resolution while discarding the complement. The uncovered region is the part most likely to surprise a later session.
- **Space-creation framing**: treating "build the reduced space" as the work and skipping the facet decomposition. The equivalence claim, left implicit, becomes an assumption rather than a tested facet.
- **New-protocol creep**: growing the utility into a standalone protocol with its own deficit. The composite is sufficient; a new mechanism would duplicate `/bound` and `/inquire`.
- **Constraint sync by relay**: drawing the reduced-space boundary on the user's behalf. The boundary constitutes the claim, so it is the user's to set.
- **Silent facet selection**: forming the facet frame and bounding the space without surfacing the frame for user recognition. Which facets count is the attention-shaping act; chosen silently, it injects the AI's bias into the very frame that licenses the claim.
- **Confirmation-only terminal**: treating the test as complete only when it confirms, with no honest terminal for a disconfirming or inconclusive result. A validation that cannot fail validates nothing; the disconfirming outcome is first-class.

## Operational checklist (per cycle)

- [ ] Phase 0 the `InferenceUncertainClaim` is stated; a `/elicit` or `/induce` front is used only when the intent is aporetic or the pattern is unnamed
- [ ] Phase 1 critical facets, surrogate↔target difference inventory, influence-path hypotheses, and a gap-measurement approach are surfaced as the `ScopedClaimFrame`, and the frame is surfaced for user recognition (with an Emergent missing-facet probe) before Phase 2 draws the boundary over it
- [ ] Phase 2 projects an actually emitted, applicable `DefinedBoundary` into test scope and coverage `Residual` against `ScopedClaimFrame`, retaining pending obligations in the scope record, and every part of the cut the user did not draw themselves — an observed fact or an AI choice inside a grant drawing nothing — is surfaced for their recognition before projection; a projection waits while its boundary has reopened; absent that result, the actual exit and what it left — a withdrawal's record or a gate still holding — govern continuation
- [ ] Phase 3 `/inquire` captures `EmpiricalEvidence` inside the bounded space under a scope-covers-claim discipline
- [ ] Phase 4 the resolution is scoped to the tested conditions (no absolute claim; a disconfirming/inconclusive outcome recorded as a first-class resolution, not retried into a confirmation) and the `Residual` is routed to a follow-up protocol
- [ ] Empirical convergence pairs the scoped result and its scope record (including pending obligations, sources, and next treatment) with the coverage residual and its routing; a `CoverageShortfall` retains that record even without a slice resolution, and follow-up consumption reads it before relying on the result
