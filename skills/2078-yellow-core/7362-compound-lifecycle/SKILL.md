# compound-lifecycle

## What It Does

Maintains the long-term quality of the `docs/solutions/` catalog. Without
this skill, `knowledge-compounder` keeps writing entries (the catalog
grows ~50/month at current rate) but nothing ever marks an entry stale,
notices when two entries cover the same fix pattern, or consolidates
clusters into a single canonical doc. The result is silent drift: two
docs eventually say different things, the `learnings-researcher` returns
contradictory hits, and the catalog quality erodes faster than it grows.

Three operations:

1. **Staleness detection** — flag entries whose composite freshness score
   falls below threshold. Uses time-since-modified, inbound reference
   count, retrieval recency, and (when ruvector is available) embedding
   age. A heavily-cited entry ages more slowly (the citation discount
   reduces the effective age contribution), making false-flags unlikely
   in practice; a recent entry with a broken file reference is stale even
   if it was written yesterday.
2. **Overlap detection** — cluster entries by `category` + `tags` first
   (cheap), then run a BM25 pre-filter on `problem:` lines, then (when
   ruvector is available) run cosine similarity on the top BM25 hits and
   surface clusters with similarity ≥ 0.82.
3. **Consolidation hand-off** — for each detected cluster or stale
   entry, present the user with a one-question `AskUserQuestion` choice
   (Keep / Update / Consolidate / Replace / Delete-and-archive). On
   Consolidate or Replace approval, dispatch `knowledge-compounder` via
   `Agent` to write the merged entry, then archive the superseded
   originals to `docs/solutions/archived/<original-category>/`.

The skill **never deletes**. Per yellow-plugins convention, superseded
entries move to `docs/solutions/archived/`. Git history alone is not
enough — archived entries remain searchable and citable, just out of
the live catalog.

## When to Use

User says any of:

- "refresh `docs/solutions/`"
- "audit learnings"
- "clean up stale docs"
- "consolidate overlapping entries"
- "compound lifecycle"
- "/yellow-core:compound-lifecycle"

Auto-invocation by `knowledge-compounder` (on writing an entry that
supersedes an older one in the same `category`) is a deferred integration —
`knowledge-compounder` explicitly does not do this yet. Until it lands,
invoke this skill manually in that situation, passing a narrow scope hint
via `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., a single file path).

Do NOT use for: writing new entries (that's `knowledge-compounder`),
searching the catalog (that's `learnings-researcher`), or general
documentation refactor.

## Usage

Invoke as `/yellow-core:compound-lifecycle [scope-hint]`.

`scope-hint` (optional) narrows the audit: a category name
(`code-quality`), a file path (`docs/solutions/security-issues/foo.md`),
a tag, or a keyword. When omitted, the skill audits the entire catalog.

Append `mode:autofix` to `$ARGUMENTS` for non-interactive operation
(e.g., scheduled background runs). Autofix mode applies unambiguous
classifications (Keep / Update with file-rename evidence) and marks all
ambiguous cases (Consolidate / Replace / Delete-and-archive) as
`status: stale` with a `stale_reason` field for human review later. It
NEVER auto-merges — every consolidation requires human approval.

### Step 1 — Discover candidate set

Glob `docs/solutions/**/*.md`, excluding:

- `README.md` files
- `docs/solutions/archived/**` (already-archived entries)
- `docs/solutions/_lifecycle-runs/**` (autofix run reports — avoid self-ingestion)

Read frontmatter (`limit: 30`) of each candidate. Collect: `title`,
`track`, `tags`, `problem`, `category`, `severity`, `status` (when
present), `updated:` or file mtime fallback.

### Step 2 — Apply scope hint (if provided)

Filter the candidate set by the scope hint, in this order:

1. **Path match** — exact path or directory match
2. **Category match** — frontmatter `category:` equals hint
3. **Tag match** — hint appears in `tags:` array
4. **Keyword match** — `Grep` for the hint across remaining frontmatter
   and first paragraph of body

Stop at the first match form that produces results. If no candidates
remain, report "No matching entries; scope hint produced empty set" and
stop.

### Step 3 — Route by scope

Match the candidate count to one of three routing tiers:

| Tier | Count | Interaction |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Focused** | 1–2 | Investigate directly, present one classification recommendation |
| **Batch** | 3–8 | Investigate all, present a single grouped recommendation table |
| **Broad** | 9+ | Triage first (Phase 0 below), then investigate in clusters |

#### Phase 0 (Broad scope only): Triage

For broad-scope runs, do a lightweight triage before deep
investigation:

1. Group candidates by `category` + dominant `tags` token (most-frequent
   tag across the candidate's `tags:` array)
2. Spot-check drift in each cluster: do the file paths in `problem:` /
   first body paragraph still exist? `Grep` the cited paths across the
   live tree
3. Surface the highest-impact cluster (most candidates × most missing
   references) with a one-sentence rationale, then `AskUserQuestion`:
   start there, pick another, or process everything in impact order
4. In autofix mode, skip the question and process clusters in
   impact-descending order

### Step 4 — Investigate candidates

For each candidate (within the chosen scope/cluster), gather evidence
along these dimensions:

- **References** — do the file paths and module names cited in
  `problem:` / body still exist? `Grep` for them in the live tree
- **Solution accuracy** — when the body cites concrete code (a
  `printf` pattern, a regex, a config snippet), does it still match
  what's in the codebase?
- **Cross-references** — are linked-to docs (`See …`) still present?
- **Inbound references** — `Grep` for the candidate's path across
  `docs/`, `plugins/`, and the rest of the catalog. Count incoming
  citations.
- **Retrieval recency** — when ruvector is available, query
  `mcp__plugin_yellow-ruvector_ruvector__hooks_recall` with the entry's
  `problem:` line and check whether this entry surfaces in top-3
  results for its own problem statement (a self-recall failure is a
  drift signal)

### Step 5 — Compute staleness and overlap

Before computing ANY staleness score or overlap cluster, Read
`references/scoring-and-clustering.md` (sibling to this SKILL.md). It
contains the exact composite staleness formula and weights, the
mandatory citation gate (`inbound_refs >= 5` → Keep, skip scoring), the
ruvector-unavailable fallbacks, the two-pass overlap clustering with its
BM25 and cosine thresholds, and the per-project configuration keys. Do
not score from memory: an improvised formula or threshold silently
reclassifies entries, and the citation gate MUST run before the score
(it is a pre-check, not a tiebreaker).

### Step 6 — Classify

For each stale or overlapping candidate (or cluster), classify into one
of five outcomes. The classification is a recommendation; the user has
final say in interactive mode.

| Outcome | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Keep** | Still accurate, still useful, drift is cosmetic only | No file edit; report "reviewed, retained" |
| **Update** | References drifted (file moved / renamed) but the recommended fix still matches reality | Apply evidence-backed in-place edits to paths and metadata |
| **Consolidate** | Two or more entries cover the same fix pattern, all are correct, none subsumes the others | Hand off to `knowledge-compounder` to write a merged canonical entry; archive the originals |
| **Replace** | The recommended fix conflicts with current code; a better successor exists or has been freshly captured | Hand off to `knowledge-compounder` to write the successor (citing the original as historical context); archive the original |
| **Delete-and-archive** | The cited code no longer exists, no successor was found, and inbound citations are absent or decorative | Move to `docs/solutions/archived/<original-category>/`; do NOT git-rm |

**Drift boundary — Update vs Replace:** if you find yourself rewriting
the solution section or changing what the entry recommends, stop —
that is Replace, not Update. Update fixes paths and references; Replace
is a new write.

**Decorative vs substantive citations:** an inbound reference that
states the principle inline ("see also: X for context") is decorative;
a reference that depends on the cited content ("we use X's regex form
verbatim") is substantive. Substantive citations block
Delete-and-archive — surface them as a Replace requirement instead.

### Step 7 — Confirm and hand off

For each non-Keep classification, present the user with the
recommendation via `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Title:** the entry's `problem:` line, or for clusters, "N entries
  on \<shared problem\>"
- **Recommendation:** the classification (Update / Consolidate / Replace
  / Delete-and-archive)
- **Evidence:** one-line summary (the most concrete drift signal)
- **Options:** four buttons — Apply recommendation / Pick a different
  outcome / Skip this entry / Other (free-text override reason)

In autofix mode, skip the question. Apply Update unconditionally.
Mark Consolidate / Replace / Delete-and-archive candidates as
`status: stale` with `stale_reason: <classification rationale>` and
`stale_date: <today>` in their frontmatter, and surface them in the
Recommendations section of the final report.

### Step 8 — Execute

#### Update

In-place edits via `Edit` tool. Preserve frontmatter shape. Bump the
`updated:` field to today's date. Record the change in the run report
under "Applied".

#### Consolidate or Replace

1. Build a `<consolidation-context>` block containing:
   - the source entries' full bodies (sanitized: replace `&` with
     `&amp;`, then `<` with `&lt;`, then `>` with `&gt;`)
   - the user's stated rationale (if provided via the "Other" option)
   - target category and tags (union of the originals)
2. Dispatch `knowledge-compounder` via `Agent`:

   ```text
   Agent(
     subagent_type: "yellow-core:workflow:knowledge-compounder",
     description: "Consolidate <N> entries into one canonical doc",
     prompt: "<consolidation-context block>"
   )
   ```

3. Wait for the agent's return. The new entry's path is the agent's
   output. Verify it exists.
4. Archive each source entry: `mv` from
   `docs/solutions/<category>/<slug>.md` to
   `docs/solutions/archived/<category>/<slug>.md`. Preserve the
   directory structure — `archived/` mirrors the live tree's
   subdirectory layout.
5. Append a `superseded_by:` field to each archived entry's
   frontmatter pointing to the new canonical entry's path.
6. Record both the new entry creation and the archive moves in the run
   report.

#### Delete-and-archive

Same as the archive step in Consolidate (move + `superseded_by`
frontmatter), but skip the `knowledge-compounder` dispatch since
there's no successor entry.

### Step 9 — Report

Present a synthesized summary, regardless of mode. Before writing it,
Read `references/report-template.md` and emit the report exactly in the
shape given there — the section names and field lines are the contract
downstream readers rely on; an improvised shape breaks them.

In autofix mode, write the report to
`docs/solutions/_lifecycle-runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HH-MM-SS>.md`. In
interactive mode, surface the report inline. (The `_lifecycle-runs/`
directory is excluded from candidate discovery by Step 1's explicit
exclusion list above; `learnings-researcher` itself does not currently
filter `_`-prefixed paths, so its broad search may still surface
report content. Updating `learnings-researcher` to add the same
exclusion is a separate follow-up.)

## Configuration

Per-project tuning lives in `.claude/yellow-plugins.local.md` per the
`local-config` skill schema. The recognized keys (staleness weights,
threshold, citation gate, overlap percentile and cosine floors) are
documented alongside the formulas they parametrize in
`references/scoring-and-clustering.md` — the Step 5 load above already
brings them into context.

## Integration

- **Invoked by users** via `/yellow-core:compound-lifecycle`
- **Invoked by `knowledge-compounder`** when a freshly-written entry
  flags an older entry as superseded (passed as a path scope hint) —
  deferred integration, not yet implemented (see "When to Use" above);
  invoke manually until it lands
- **Reads** every entry in `docs/solutions/` (excluding
  `archived/` and `README.md`)
- **Writes** `docs/solutions/<category>/<slug>.md` (in-place Updates) and
  `docs/solutions/archived/<category>/<slug>.md` (archive moves)
- **Dispatches** `knowledge-compounder` via `Agent` for Consolidate and
  Replace classifications

## Why "archive, don't delete"

The rationale for diverging from the upstream delete-and-rely-on-git
model (searchability, citation continuity, drift forensics) and the
current caveat about `learnings-researcher` not yet filtering
`docs/solutions/archived/**` are in `references/design-rationale.md`.
