# Pattern: Morph-Discovery

Discover morph tools at runtime via ToolSearch. Prefer morph when available
for large file edits and intent-based code search. Fall back to built-in
tools silently when morph is not installed.

## What It Does

Uses `ToolSearch` keyword queries (`"morph edit"`, `"morph warpgrep"`) to
discover morph tools at runtime, prefers them for qualifying operations
(large/non-contiguous edits, intent-based searches), and silently uses the
built-in `Edit`/`Grep` tools when morph is not installed.

## When to Use

When authoring an agent or command that performs file edits or code search
and would benefit from morph's efficiency for large/scattered edits or
semantic searches — but should also work without yellow-morph installed.
Skip for trivial single-line edits or exact-string greps where built-ins are
already optimal.

## Usage

### For File Editing

```text
1. Call ToolSearch("morph edit")
2. If found AND (file > 200 lines OR change spans 3+ non-contiguous regions):
   prefer morph edit_file over built-in Edit
3. If not found OR file is small with contiguous changes:
   use built-in Edit
4. No warning on fallback. No degradation message.
```

### For Intent-Based Code Search

```text
1. Call ToolSearch("morph warpgrep")
2. If found AND query is intent-based ("what calls this function?",
   "find similar patterns", "blast radius of this change"):
   prefer morph codebase_search (aka WarpGrep)
3. If not found OR query is exact-match (specific string, regex):
   use built-in Grep
4. No warning on fallback. No degradation message.
```

### Design Choices

- **Keyword-based ToolSearch** (`"morph edit"`, `"morph warpgrep"`) rather than
  `select:<exact_name>` — resilient to tool renames.
- **Per-command discovery** rather than session-level caching — ToolSearch is
  fast (sub-100ms), avoids coupling to morph package names.
- **No hard dependency** — morph tools are never listed in command
  `allowed-tools`. Discovery happens at runtime.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do not** add morph tools to command `allowed-tools` — use ToolSearch
  discovery
- **Do not** warn or message the user when morph is not available
