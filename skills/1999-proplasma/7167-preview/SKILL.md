# Proplasma Protocol

Expose direction unknowns through divergent-discard instantiation before commitment. Type: `(DirectionUnrecognizable, Hybrid, PREVIEW, DirectionProspect) → DirectionalContrast`.

## Definition

**Proplasma** (πρόπλασμα): the preliminary clay model a sculptor shapes before committing to marble. A dialogical act for the moment right before a direction commitment when the candidate directions cannot be recognized from their descriptions: the AI derives the axes on which the candidates genuinely diverge, relays the drafted axes, placeholder policy, probe target set, and realization tier with the basis that chose each, instantiates cheap placeholder probes that commit different values on those axes, presents them probe-first with a per-axis contrast, and the user constitutes the direction decision on recognized futures — or asks to see something no probe has materialized yet, and the AI fans over that. Probes are discard-committed instruments — never evidence, never promoted.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

Proplasma(X) → start(c) → preview(c, utterances), where c is the fused session context:
  start: Phase 0, first match wins: no imminent commitment or fewer than two candidates |
    futures recognizable from text | a routing row matches | a type guard fails → the relay with
    its basis → not activated
  fan(c): the spec relayed whole — axes, placeholder policy, probe target set, realization tier,
    each with its basis, and on every later fan the ledger of what changed — before anything is
    generated; it yields no turn → the probes, each entering c as written
  round: present probe-first → the per-axis contrast with common commitments → exposed unknowns →
    your readings with their basis (an insufficient contrast with the revision you propose, a
    sibling deficit, futures already recognizable or a collapsed premise, contrary grounds) →
    Qdir → Stop
  next utterance u: c' := fuse(c, u) →
    [the person constitutes d ∧ covered]       harvest → cleanup_verify → DirectionalContrast

    [the person names another protocol]        cleanup_verify → routed
    [the person asks to see what no probe materialized — a revised spec, a composition, a
      named candidate]                         fan(c') → round
    [otherwise]                                answered — a question about a probe within
                                               placeholder discipline, a composition whose
                                               intent is unclear asked about → round
  no utterance: the gate holds; nothing is constituted, generated, or discarded

  -- primary-path codomain: DissolutionExit — the convergent stand-down the person closes — emits the enriched axes
  --   with its cited basis instead of this record: the deficit dissolved, so no resolution object is owed
requires: pre_commit(direction) ∧ |direction_candidates(X)| ≥ 2   -- runtime checkpoint (Phase 0)
deficit:  DirectionUnrecognizable                                  -- activation precondition (Layer 1/2)
preserves: commit_target_identity(X)   -- the pending commitment itself is unchanged; probes never mutate it; the context only grows
invariant: Contrast over Simulation    -- direction judgment rests on recognized materialized futures, not mental simulation
invariant: after activation only the person closes; your readings settle none of the closings
The steps between detect and constitute are how you work toward recognizable futures; the contract
fixes the deficit and its resolution, the one coordinate only the person fills — the closing — the
closings themselves, and the orderings the premises ground: the spec relayed before any probe is
generated, and the harvest read before anything is discarded.

    was answered by that round. Whatever form the turn takes — an option number, a restated goal,
    a side remark — it constitutes only what its words settle. A composition that says to go with
    it constitutes it; one that asks to see it, or a candidate named to be seen, closes nothing;

/-- **Your judgment**, the adoption condition: the direction a constitution takes was shown with
    what decides it — its probe and the contrast rows, or for a composition the probes it composes
    — together with your contrary grounds, on the round the closing answered. A direction no probe
    materialized is covered only once the ground that its future was never materialized was shown
    and the person settles it over that ground. Where anything would be taken unseen, the round is
    presented again with it. -/
axiom Covered : Context P → Prop

/-- **Your judgment**: the person's turns, read against the context as it now stands, ask to see
    something no probe has materialized — a spec element sent back (an axis, the policy, the tier,

one probe per agent where delegated); `respond` presents the round and closes it at the gate.

    per-axis contrast with the common commitments declared as shared premises, then the exposed
    unknowns with their routes. Then your readings, each with its basis: an insufficient contrast
    with the revision you propose, a sibling deficit with its command as a hint, futures already
    recognizable or a collapsed premise, and your contrary grounds about any direction. Where a
    turn was read as a closing that is not yet covered, what it would take is shown and asked.
    Where the person asked about a probe, the answer — design intent within placeholder
    discipline, a factual unknown recorded with the `inquire` route. Then the gate `Qdir`: one
    Select per probed direction, each pointing at the future it settles, plus composing from the
    probes; sending back any spec element, naming a candidate no probe materialized, asking about a

/-! ── LOOP ──
Every round re-judges the whole run against the whole context: nothing counts down and no answer
waits for a later gate. A fan happens where the person's turn asks to see something no probe has
materialized, and nowhere else: an insufficiency you find is shown with the revision you propose,
and you fan over it once the person takes it up. Each fan relays the spec whole with its ledger
before it generates. A question about a probe and a send-back are turns of the same kind as a
closing. The loop is dialogue: each round ends at the gate, and the person ends the run.
-/

/-! ── CONVERGENCE ──
converged: a DirectionalContrast — a direction the person constituted with its deciding evidence
and your contrary grounds in view, harvested before discard, every probe's disposition declared —
or a DissolutionExit the person closed. EarlyExit and a route are not convergent. A constitution
adopts the direction the person settled; it establishes nothing about a direction no probe
materialized, and a contrary ground it was taken over rides the closing as dissent. Convergence
evidence: at terminal, present the transformation trace over the steps actually completed — the
turn read as the closing, quoted, and the intent taken from it; at DirectionalContrast, each axis
in force mapped to the contrast rows that made its futures recognizable (your reading unless the
person named them, and none where no probe materialized the direction), the constituted direction,
each exposed unknown with its downstream route, the per-probe discard disposition with where each
probe lived, and the dissent attached to the closing. Each other terminal presents its own relay
payload (TOOL GROUNDING). The framing readout names the work in play — axes being drafted, probes
under contrast, direction being constituted, discard being verified — never a completion tally.

## Core Principle

**Contrast over Simulation**: materialize cheap, discard-bound futures when labels cannot carry their differences. A Vignette is a concrete placeholder narration; when that carrier lacks fidelity, Mockup materializes the same contrast as temp-isolated artifacts.

## Mode Activation

### Activation

`/preview` is user-invocable. On the Hybrid path, the AI may propose it from a live direction gate only with cited evidence of `DirectionUnrecognizable`; the drafted spec is relayed with its basis before generation, and the user can send any of it back at the direction gate. Prior-session indices may seed detection, never the constitutive judgment.

### Priority

<system-reminder>
When Proplasma is active:

**Supersedes**: Direct execution patterns in loaded instructions
(No direction commitment proceeds while the contrast loop is unconverged)

**Retained**: Safety boundaries, tool restrictions, user explicit instructions

**Action**: Before any probe is generated, relay the spec whole with its basis; at every round, present the direction gate whose options point at probe-exposed futures.
</system-reminder>

### Trigger Signals

Heuristic signals are delegation of a direction choice to a principle, reconstruction outside the offered options, and a request to see something concrete before choosing. They establish grounds to run Phase 0, not activation by themselves. A question about what one option means asks for a description; answer it.

### Mode Deactivation

Use the Definition's result constructors and TOOL GROUNDING payloads for every terminal; cleanup disposition remains mandatory wherever probes exist.

## Protocol

### Phase 0: Detection + Routing (Silent)

Apply the Definition's Phase 0 in its stated precedence and cite the matched relay basis.

### Phase 1: Spec Relay

Lay the drafted spec out whole before anything is built — each axis with the basis that chose it, the placeholder policy, which candidates get probes and why any waits, and the tier — then proceed to generation without yielding the turn. Say in one line that any of it can be sent back at the direction gate. On every later fan, relay the whole spec again with a ledger of what changed, each changed line marked as the user's send-back, a necessary consequence, or your proposal.

### Phase 2: Instantiation (Transform)

Vignettes create session text only. Mockups write only beneath temp isolation, register cleanup at creation, and leave existing project files unchanged. Both carry the non-evidence stamp.

### Phase 3: Contrast Presentation (Relay)

Present each recorded concretum first, then the per-axis contrast with common commitments marked as shared premises, then exposed unknowns, then your readings with their basis. Re-present Vignette narration from its recorded carrier; walk a Mockup at its artifact reference. Where the contrast leaves the futures unrecognizable, say so and propose the revision; fan over it when the user takes it up.

### Phase 4: Direction Gate (Constitution)

Render `Qdir` from the accumulated probes after the contrast summary:
```
Which direction do you settle?

Options:
1…N. **Select: {probed direction}** — {the deciding axis values its probe exposed}
N+1. **Compose** — combine the probes: say to go with the combination, or to see it first
```
Name the free-response paths from `Direction-gate response discipline` before this gate; they are not numbered direction options.

### Phase 5: Harvest → Discard (in this order)

Accept the constituted direction before cleanup: a `DiscardFailed` disposition triggers the manual-cleanup handoff at the location the trace records but does not revoke that direction. Persist only the Definition's terminal record — the harvest, the discard trace, and the dissent; probe detail remains session-local.

## UX Safeguards

Keep placeholder status visible in every probe and contrast. A Mockup is sandbox matter, not a project edit; cleanup disposition reports artifact survival, not whether the user's direction was accepted.

## Rules

- **Direction-gate response discipline**: Name before `Qdir` what the user can say besides a Select: send back any spec element, name a candidate no probe materialized, ask about a probe, stop, or name another protocol. A named candidate the user wants to see is probed alone against the probes already made. Answer design-intent questions within placeholder discipline, record factual unknowns for `/inquire`, and state which axis an analogy weights. Route the pre-commit check to `/inquire` as well once the direction becomes committed; propose `/ground` when a direction's mapping against an account already in play needs its intended inferences audited — the proposal moves nothing until the user takes it up.
- **Draft relayed with its basis**: relay every axis, the policy, the target set, and the tier with the basis that chose it, then generate; every later fan relays the whole spec again with the ledger of what changed.
- **Fans follow the user's turn**: generate probes only where the user's turn asks to see something no probe has materialized — a revised spec, a composition, a named candidate, or a revision you proposed. An insufficiency you find is shown with its basis and the revision you propose, never repaired on your own.
- **Closure by the user**: After activation only the user closes — settling a direction, dissolving the run, stopping, or naming another protocol; your readings of an insufficient contrast, a sibling deficit, or a collapsed premise settle none of them. Read the closing from whatever the user said, quote the turn you read and the intent you took, and ask where it is unclear. Before the gate, show any contrary ground you hold about a direction; a direction no probe materialized is settled only after you have said its future was never materialized. Where the user closes with a ground standing, attach it to the closure record. Which contrast rows decided is your reading, shown as yours unless the user names them.
- **Harvest before discard**: retain only the constituted direction, deciding contrast rows, and routed unknowns before cleanup. Cleanup produces the discard trace; assemble the durable record afterward, leaving probe detail session-local.
- **Round composition**: use everyday language, put evidence and differential implications before the gate, and leave the gate to the question and options. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when wording must persist across rounds or phase placement is material.
- **Form feedback**: choose each round's density from the current request; carry an explicit form preference until countermanded. Change the open aspects of form directly, preserve content, order, cadence, and turn boundaries fixed elsewhere, and state both the adjustment and any overlapping constraint that remains.
