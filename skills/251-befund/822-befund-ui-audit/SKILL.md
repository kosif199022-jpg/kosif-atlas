description: Statically audits JSX/TSX, Vue/Svelte, HTML, and CSS/SCSS source for accessibility, semantic-markup, and design-token problems -- never running or rendering the app. Use when the user asks to "audit UI accessibility", "check our components for a11y issues", "find hardcoded design values", "review this UI before we ship", or as part of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase. Not for designing an interface that does not exist yet, and not a design critique -- for build-time design of a new screen or surface use cupertino-council, and for the end-to-end design pipeline that surface belongs to use cupertino-review.

# befund-ui-audit

Statically audit UI source for accessibility, semantic markup, and hardcoded design values.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-ui-audit
```

Stop on non-zero exit. Carry the returned `skip_verification` through to Step 3.

## Step 1: Detect UI files, degrade if none found

Glob for `*.jsx`, `*.tsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.scss`. If none are found,
write `UI_AUDIT.md` and `ui_audit_summary.json` with `applicable: false` and a one-line reason,
then stop -- this is a degrade to "Not applicable," never an error.

## Step 2: Static audit only

Dispatch `ui-auditor` against the detected files. The agent never runs or builds the app, never
renders a DOM, and never drives a browser -- it reads source only. Look for:

- Accessibility: missing `alt` text, missing form labels/accessible names, non-interactive
  elements used as controls (`<div onClick>`), positive `tabindex`.
- Semantic markup: a clickable `<div>` where `<button>` belongs, skipped heading levels,
  missing landmark elements.
- Hardcoded design values: literal colors/dimensions where the codebase otherwise uses a
  design-token or CSS-variable system.
- Contrast: plausibly low-contrast literal color pairs. This MUST be flagged as a static
  heuristic only -- never compute or assert a real WCAG contrast ratio, since no renderer is
  running to measure actual rendered contrast.

## Step 3: Verify

Unless `skip_verification` is set, re-read each cited location to confirm the finding before it
is reported.

## Step 4: Validate and write

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind ui_audit_summary --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

The validator rejects any `contrast`-kind finding that does not carry `heuristic: true`.

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename UI_AUDIT.md
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename ui_audit_summary.json
```

Write `UI_AUDIT.md` with the Write tool at its resolved path, with one section per finding
category (Accessibility, Semantic markup, Hardcoded design values, Contrast) listing each
verified finding's location and description. Write `ui_audit_summary.json` alongside it at its
own resolved path.

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit outside the resolved output paths, never run a dev server, build command,
or browser automation tool.
