name: befund-transform-execute
description: Applies exactly one human-authorized phase of MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md to the codebase. Use when the user explicitly asks to "execute phase N from the modernization brief", "apply this transform phase", or "run the merge/split transform-execute proposed". It applies exactly one human-authorized phase from MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md, gated behind transform.mode="execute", a clean tree, and every Open Question resolved -- then hands off to andon-verify without self-verifying. Not for applying a set of approved fixes across a repo, or for proving each fix as it lands -- that is andon-loop; this skill requires a numbered phase in MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md and refuses without one.

# befund-transform-execute

Apply one, and only one, already-authorized phase's structural change from
`MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md`. This is the plugin's most dangerous skill -- every gate below is a
hard refusal, not a suggestion, and every one of them is enforced by the CLI, not by this
document's prose.

## Step 1: The mode gate -- refuse outright in 'plan' mode

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" transform-mode-gate --repo <repo_root> --phase <N>
```

A non-zero exit here means either `transform.mode` is not `"execute"` in
`.claude/befund.local.md`, or phase `<N>` is not listed in
`transform.authorized_phases`. In either case: stop immediately, tell the user plainly what
setting is required, and do not proceed under any circumstance -- there is no override flag for
this gate.

## Step 2: Read the brief and reject a Keep(1:1) phase

Read `MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md` and `transform_brief_summary.json` for phase `<N>`'s recorded
`decision`:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" keep-phase-gate --decision "<phase N's decision>"
```

A `Keep` or `Keep(1:1)` decision has nothing to execute -- refuse and tell the user this phase
requires no structural change.

## Step 3: Every Open Question for this phase must be resolved by a human

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" open-questions-gate --open-questions <json list from the brief's phase N> --resolutions <json map the user has provided>
```

If any Open Question lacks a resolution, this call refuses -- ask the user directly for each
missing resolution (do not guess a design judgment call on the user's behalf) and re-run once
answers are in hand.

## Step 4: Dirty-tree gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" dirty-tree-gate --repo <repo_root>
```

Add `--allow-dirty` only when the user has set `require_clean_tree: false` in
`.claude/befund.local.md` AND you have told them plainly what changed paths exist. A
non-zero exit with a dirty tree and no override means: stop, show the user the changed paths,
and ask them to commit, stash, or explicitly confirm proceeding anyway.

## Step 5: Open the edit-scope lock, then dispatch transform-executor

Only after all four gates above pass, open the edit-scope lock naming exactly phase `<N>`'s
declared stage-scope files -- `guard_target_edit.py`'s PreToolUse hook is inert until this
lock exists, and only authorizes edits to the files it names, so this is what makes "the agent
refuses to touch files outside that stage scope" a mechanical deny instead of prose the agent
might not honor:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" open-edit-scope --repo <repo_root> \
    --mode transform --phase <N> --files <phase N's declared stage-scope files>
```

`--phase <N>` opens this phase's execution record,
`analysis/befund/transform-phase-<N>/run.jsonl`, which outlives the lock.

Then dispatch the `transform-executor` agent with exactly phase `<N>`'s decision, its declared
stage scope, and its (now-resolved) Open Questions. The agent refuses a second phase in the
same dispatch -- one phase, one dispatch.

Once the dispatch finishes, close the lock:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" close-edit-scope --repo <repo_root> --phase <N>
```

Closing records which of the allowed files the phase **actually changed**, measured with
`git status`, never taken from the executor's own account. If the phase stopped instead —
the agent refused, a gate tripped mid-dispatch — close with
`--halt "<the specific reason>"`, so the stop is on disk rather than only in the chat.

## Step 6: Hand off to verification -- never self-verify

Rule `verify-dispatch-handoff`: this skill's own edit is unverified the moment it lands. Do not
run any check of its own correctness here. Explicitly tell the user: "This change is
unverified -- hand off to `andon:andon-verify` for an independent adversarial tribunal, or to
`andon:andon-loop` if you want the proof recorded in an OKF ledger." Then stop.

## Never commit or push

This skill has no code path that invokes `git commit` or `git push` -- integrating the change
into history stays a manual human decision, always.
