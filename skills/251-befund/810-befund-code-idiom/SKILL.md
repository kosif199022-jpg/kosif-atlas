description: Judges idioms against the actual language version declared in the repo's manifest, never a fixed list, and categorizes each finding as modernization or smell. Use when the user asks to "find modernization opportunities", "check for deprecated idioms", "find code smells", or as part of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase.

# befund-code-idiom

Find deprecated idioms the repo's own declared language version obsoletes, plus generic code
smells.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-code-idiom
```

## Step 1: Detect the actual version per language -- never assume one

Rule: judge idioms against the version the manifest actually declares, not a fixed list or
training-data assumption:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" detect-language-version --repo <repo_root> --language python
```

Run once per detected language (reuse `detect-languages` from preflight/stage-map for the
list). A `null` result means the manifest declares no version constraint -- in that case, only
flag idioms deprecated in EVERY version the language has ever shipped, never a version-specific
one, since there is nothing to judge against.

## Step 2: Find findings, categorized

Dispatch `idiom-auditor` with the detected version per language and (if present)
`.claude/house-rules.md` for repo-specific style context. Every finding MUST carry
`category` in `{"modernization", "smell"}`:

- `modernization`: a deprecated language/library idiom the detected version actually
  obsoletes (e.g. `Optional[X]` when the manifest declares Python >=3.10 supports `X | None`).
  Never flag an idiom the declared version does NOT obsolete.
- `smell`: a generic quality issue (broad `except`, magic numbers, long functions, deep
  nesting, missing types in an otherwise-typed module) that requires design judgment, not a
  mechanical rewrite.

Findings ambiguous enough that a mechanical fix could be wrong (e.g. the "modern" idiom would
change behavior in this codebase's edge case) MUST carry a `severityNote` -- this is the flag
`befund-idiom-fix` uses later to skip auto-applying them.

Every `modernization` finding MUST also carry `kind` (an idiom-pattern slug, e.g.
`optional-union-syntax`) -- `befund-idiom-fix` clusters remediation work by `(file, kind)`
and cannot group findings that omit it.

## Step 3: Verify

Unless `skip_verification` is set, confirm each finding by re-reading the cited code and
re-checking it against the detected version -- never trust the first pass.

## Step 4: Validate and write

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind code_idiom_summary --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

The validator rejects any finding whose `category` is outside `{modernization, smell}`.

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename CODE_IDIOM.md
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename code_idiom_summary.json
```

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit outside the resolved output paths, and never apply a finding here --
`befund-idiom-fix` is the only skill authorized to act on `code_idiom_summary.json`.
