description: Reports which befund artifacts exist, whether they're stale relative to the latest commit, and never fabricates data for a skill that has not run. Use when the user asks "where does befund stand", "what's stale in our analysis", "what should we run next", or "befund status".

# befund-status

Report the current state of befund's analysis for this repository, without inventing
anything for a skill that has never run.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-status
```

## Step 1: Find only artifacts that actually exist

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" status-present-artifacts --repo <repo_root>
```

The `present` map contains a key ONLY for a finding-producing skill whose artifact
exists on disk right now. Rule `status-no-fabrication`: never add a key with an empty object,
a placeholder, or a guessed status for a skill that has not run -- if it is not in `present`,
omit it from the dashboard entirely.

The same call also returns a `structural` map, built the identical way, for
`befund-complexity-score`, `befund-stage-map`, and `befund-transform-brief` --
these are progress/synthesis artifacts, not findings domains, so `structural`'s contents MUST
NEVER be folded into `present` or counted by `recommend_transform_brief` (running
befund-stage-map is not itself a finding). But they ARE part of the dashboard: a user
asking "where does befund stand" needs to know stage-map has already run, not just that no
findings-producing skill has. Surface `structural` as its own section, distinct from `present`'s
findings table, applying the same `status-no-fabrication` rule (omit a skill entirely if it is
not in `structural`, never fabricate a placeholder for one that hasn't run).

## Step 2: Staleness

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" staleness-check --repo <repo_root> --artifact <path1> --artifact <path2> ...
```

Pass every path from **both** `present` and `structural`. `stale: true` means that artifact's
mtime predates the repo's latest commit -- surface this per-artifact in the dashboard, in
whichever section (findings or structural) that artifact belongs to. If the repo has no commits
or is not under git, `latest_commit_ts` is `null` and every staleness value is `null` (unknown) --
report it as "staleness unknown," never guess `stale: false`.

## Step 3: Recommend transform-brief when warranted

The same `status-present-artifacts` call returns `recommend_transform_brief: true` when at
least one artifact exists but `MODERNIZATION_BRIEF.md` does not. Surface this
recommendation prominently when true.

## Step 4: Write outputs

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename findings-dashboard.html
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename findings_dashboard_data.json
```

Write `findings-dashboard.html` (a static HTML summary) and `findings_dashboard_data.json`
(only the keys actually present, plus staleness and the transform-brief recommendation).

Before any finding-producing skill has run, `present` is empty and there is nothing to add
staleness for -- write the object as-is rather than fabricating an entry:

```json
{
  "present": {},
  "structural": {},
  "recommend_transform_brief": false
}
```

Once a skill has run, its key carries the artifact path and staleness for that path (omit any
skill not in `present`/`structural`, per `status-no-fabrication` above):

```json
{
  "present": {
    "befund-lint-audit": {
      "artifact": "analysis/befund/lint-audit.json",
      "stale": false
    }
  },
  "structural": {},
  "recommend_transform_brief": true
}
```

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit outside the two resolved output paths.
