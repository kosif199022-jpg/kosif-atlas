description: Extracts falsifiable claims about current code state from CLAUDE.md, README.md, DECISIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and ADR files, and verifies each against the cited code. Use when the user asks to "check documentation accuracy", "find doc drift", "verify our docs match the code", or as part of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase. Excludes CI/CD-specific doc claims, handled by befund-ci-topology, and structural contract/docstring drift -- type signatures, docstring parameter/return declarations, or API/OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas versus their call sites -- handled by zeugnis-contract-drift.

# befund-docs-drift

Find contradictions between what the documentation claims about current code state and what
the code actually does.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-docs-drift
```

## Step 1: Extract falsifiable claims

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and any `docs/adr/*` or
`ADR-*.md` files. Extract only claims that are falsifiable against current code state --
skip aspirational or roadmap language ("we plan to", "will eventually", "TODO", "future work").
Each extracted claim needs a `text`, a `doc_citation` (`path:line`), and ideally a
`code_citation` once located.

## Step 2: Exclude CI/CD-specific claims -- ci-topology's scope only

Rule `docs-drift-not-ci-specific`: run every extracted claim through the CI-scope filter before
verifying anything:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" exclude-ci-claims --claims <json list>
```

Claims returned under `excluded_to_ci_topology` (anything citing `.github/workflows/`,
`.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.circleci/config.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, or mentioning
git remotes / mirror scripts / pipeline config) are dropped from this skill's output entirely
-- do not report them here even as a footnote. Point the user at `befund-ci-topology`
instead. Only `in_scope` claims proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Verify every in-scope claim

Unless `skip_verification` is set, dispatch the `docs-drift-auditor` agent to read the cited
code for every claim and confirm or refute it by static comparison only -- never by executing
example code from the docs. Each verified claim gets a `status` in
`{"confirmed", "contradicted", "unverifiable"}` and, when contradicted, a `code_citation`
showing exactly where the code diverges. A contradicted claim looks like:

```json
{
  "text": "All API requests are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute.",
  "doc_citation": "README.md:42",
  "status": "contradicted",
  "code_citation": "src/middleware/rate_limit.py:18"
}
```

`confirmed` and `unverifiable` claims use the same shape without `code_citation`. When
`skip_verification` is true, label every claim `verification_label: "unverified"` via:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" label-findings --repo <repo_root> --findings <json>
```

## Step 4: Validate and write

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind docs_drift_summary --file <path-or-inline-json>
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename DOCS_DRIFT.md
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename docs_drift_summary.json
```

Write `DOCS_DRIFT.md` (contradictions with file:line evidence on both the doc side and the
code side) and `docs_drift_summary.json` to the resolved paths.

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit outside the two resolved output paths. Never execute a code sample found
in the docs to "test" whether the doc claim holds -- verification is static comparison only.
