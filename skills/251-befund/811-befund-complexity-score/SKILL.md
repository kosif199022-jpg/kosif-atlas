description: Computes a relative complexity/attention-priority index per stage using the fixed formula 2.94 x (KSLOC)^1.10, and lists unmeasured stages plainly rather than inventing numbers. Use when the user asks "which module needs attention first", "score complexity per stage", "what's our tech debt hotspot", or as part of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase.

# befund-complexity-score

Compute a relative complexity/attention-priority index per stage or module.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-complexity-score
```

This skill has no Verify phase -- do not gate anything here on `skip_verification`; that
setting simply does not apply to a pure measurement.

## Step 1: Determine the stage list

Prefer `<output_dir>/stage_map.json` if it exists (reuse `befund-stage-map`'s stages).
Otherwise fall back to the detected-languages list from `detect-languages`, treating each
language's file set as one pseudo-stage.

## Step 2: Measure each stage

Dispatch `complexity-surveyor` per stage to measure SLOC, file count, and cyclomatic complexity
(via whatever tool is available for that language -- `radon`, `lizard`, `gocyclo`, etc.). If no
tool is available for a stage's language, the surveyor reports `-1`/`0` per its own refusal
list rather than fabricating a plausible-looking number -- when that happens, mark the stage
`unmeasured: true` in the output and list it plainly in `COMPLEXITY_SCORE.md` instead of
computing an index for it.

## Step 3: Apply the exact formula -- no substitutes

Rule `complexity-score-formula`: the index MUST be `2.94 x (KSLOC)^1.10` and nothing else.

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" complexity-index --ksloc <stage_sloc / 1000>
```

Use this for every measured stage rather than restating the constants inline -- the formula
lives in one place (`scripts/lib/formulas.py`) so no per-skill copy can drift from it.

## Step 4: Validate and write

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind complexity_score_summary --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

The validator recomputes `2.94 x (KSLOC)^1.10` for every non-`unmeasured` stage and rejects the
artifact if the persisted `complexity_index` does not match to within floating-point tolerance
-- a hand-typed or LLM-guessed number cannot pass.

A `complexity_score_summary.json` stage entry looks like this -- one measured, one not:

```json
{
  "stages": [
    {"stage": "api", "sloc": 4200, "complexity_index": 187.3, "unmeasured": false},
    {"stage": "legacy-perl", "sloc": 0, "complexity_index": null, "unmeasured": true}
  ]
}
```

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename COMPLEXITY_SCORE.md
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename complexity_score_summary.json
```

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit outside the resolved output paths.
