description: Extracts the real import/use graph per detected language, clusters files into stages by shallowest package boundary (never by manifest directory), and writes the full stage graph other befund skills depend on. Use when the user asks to "map the repo's architecture", "show me the real module boundaries", "map stages and wires", or as the first step of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase.

# befund-stage-map

Build the repository's real architectural map: stages (package/module boundaries) and wires
(the import/use edges between them), verified against actual source, not guessed from
directory names.

## Step 0: Settings gate

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-stage-map
```

Stop on non-zero exit. Carry the returned `output_dir` and `skip_verification` through every
later step.

## Step 1: Detect languages

Reuse the same detection as preflight -- do not hand-roll a different threshold:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" detect-languages --manifests <json> --extension-counts <json>
```

## Step 2: Extract the import graph, one inline command per language

Dispatch the `stage-mapper` agent once per detected language. Each dispatch runs the
extraction as a **single inline read-only command** (e.g. a `grep -rn` / `rg` pass over
import statements, or a language-native AST dump), never by creating scratch files -- that is
the agent's own refusal, restated here so the calling skill does not ask for anything that
would violate it.

Cluster files into stages by the **shallowest importable package boundary** in each language
(the topmost directory that is itself an importable unit -- a directory with an `__init__.py`,
a `package.json`, a `go.mod`, etc.) -- never by "which directory does the manifest that covers
this file live in," which is wrong whenever two packages share one manifest.

## Step 3: Verify candidate wires

Unless `skip_verification` is true, verify every candidate wire (an edge between two stages) by
re-reading the actual import statement at its cited location before it is trusted -- do not
accept a wire based on the extraction pass alone. Label unverified findings per
skip-verification-behavior when `skip_verification` is true (no adversarial refutation, but
every finding still carries `verified: false`).

## Step 4: Write the full graph, never sampled

Rule `stage-graph-vs-stage-map-json` requires `stage_graph.json` to carry the *complete* edge
count, not a sample -- `befund-arch-health` depends on accurate fan-in/fan-out. Build it
with top-level `stages`, `wires` (every edge), `edgeCount` (== `len(wires)`), and `deadEnds`
(stages with no outgoing wires), then validate before writing:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind stage_graph --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

The validator rejects the artifact outright if `edgeCount != len(wires)` -- a sampled edge list
cannot pass. The separate viewer-format `stage_map.json` (for STAGE_MAP.html) MAY sample down to
a handful of edges per stage for readability; only `stage_graph.json` carries this constraint.

## Step 5: Write file_stage_index.json -- deliberately partial

Rule `file-stage-index-partial-coverage`: this flat `{file: stage}` lookup MUST contain only
files that are BOTH an edge endpoint AND fall under a detected package boundary. A file that is
neither is absent by design -- do not backfill it with a guessed stage. Downstream consumers
(`befund-transform-brief`) treat a miss as `"Unattributed"`, never as an error; see
`attribute-citation` in the CLI for that exact lookup behavior.

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind file_stage_index --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

## Step 6: Resolve output paths and write

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename stage_graph.json
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename file_stage_index.json
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename stage_map_summary.json
```

Write `STAGE_MAP.md`, `stage_graph.json`, `file_stage_index.json`, and `stage_map_summary.json`
to their resolved paths. `stage_map_summary.json` is a reporting sidecar, not a load-bearing
artifact: it records a short run summary -- stage/wire counts and a timestamp -- that
`befund-status` reads only as a presence flag for its dashboard. No other befund skill
depends on its schema, so it is written directly here and never passed through
`validate-artifact`.

`stage_map.json` (viewer format, sampled edges) is not written by this skill at all: no step
above resolves a path for it or builds it, and `STAGE_MAP.html` below renders from the full
`stage_graph.json` directly, never from `stage_map.json`'s sampled edges. `befund-transform-brief`
is the sole producer of `stage_map.json` -- it creates the file, containing only a `flows` field,
when it finds the file absent, and appends that same field without altering existing stage/wire
data when the file already exists.

Then render `STAGE_MAP.html` -- a real canvas-based D3 viewer (force-directed graph layout,
pan/zoom, search, drag-to-reposition), not the old "simple static graph render":

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build_stage_map_html.py" \
    --stage-graph <resolved stage_graph.json path> \
    --file-stage-index <resolved file_stage_index.json path> \
    --template ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/stage-map-viewer.html \
    --d3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/inline-d3.html \
    --tokens ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/assets/tokens.css \
    --out <resolved STAGE_MAP.html path>
```

This reads the FULL `stage_graph.json` directly (never `stage_map.json`'s sampled edges --
canvas rendering with proper culling doesn't need the edge count thinned down for readability
the way the old prose-only render did), and reuses `lib.graph`'s own `find_cycles`/
`find_god_modules` to highlight cycles and god-modules in the viewer -- the exact same
functions `befund-arch-health` reports from, so the viewer can never show something that
skill disagrees with.

## Read-only constraint

Never use Write/Edit for anything outside the resolved output paths above. The extraction
command dispatched to `stage-mapper` is read-only (grep/AST-dump), never a scratch file or a
mutation.
