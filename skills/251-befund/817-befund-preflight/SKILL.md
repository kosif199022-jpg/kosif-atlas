name: befund-preflight
description: Verifies language detection, tool availability, smoke-parseability, house-rules presence, git/CI presence, and doc presence, then assigns a Ready/Ready-with-gaps/Not-ready verdict per downstream skill. Use when the user asks to "check if this repo is ready for befund", "run preflight", "can befund analyze this codebase", or before any other befund-* skill runs for the first time in a repo; also invoked at the start of befund-autopilot's CHECK phase.

# befund-preflight

Determine whether this repository is ready for befund's analysis skills, and which
downstream skills can run at full strength versus degraded.

## Step 0: Read settings and check the gate

Run, from the plugin root:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" check-enabled --repo <repo_root> --skill befund-preflight
```

A non-zero exit means the skill is disabled in `.claude/befund.local.md` -- stop and tell
the user plainly, quoting the stderr message. On success, the JSON on stdout carries the
resolved settings (including `output_dir`, default `analysis/befund`). Use that `output_dir` for
every output path in this skill, resolved through `resolve-output-path` (see Step 6) before
any write.

## Step 1: Run all 6 checks, unconditionally

Rule `preflight-runs-all-checks` requires every check below to run and report its own status,
even when an earlier check fails. Do not short-circuit. Wrap each check in isolation (a failed
`git` invocation, a missing manifest, a parse error) so one check's failure cannot prevent the
next from running:

1. **languages** -- glob the repo for manifest files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, etc.) and count files by extension. Call
   `detect-languages --manifests <json list of manifest basenames found> --extension-counts
   <json map of extension to count>`. This enforces the language-detection-threshold rule (an
   extension only counts once >=3 files exist and no manifest already claimed that language in
   pass 1) -- do not reimplement the threshold by hand.
2. **tools** -- probe for a language's usual toolchain (e.g. `python3 --version`, `node
   --version`, `go version`) for each detected language; record found/missing per tool.
3. **smoke_parse** -- for exactly one file per detected language (the smallest by line count is
   a reasonable pick), attempt a lightweight parse: Python via `python3 -m py_compile`,
   JavaScript/TypeScript via `node --check` (or a bare syntax check), Go via `gofmt -l`, etc. Do
   not smoke-parse more than one file per language -- that is this skill's own scope limit, not
   a downstream skill's job.
4. **house_rules** -- check for `.claude/house-rules.md`, falling back to `CLAUDE.md` with a
   `best-effort` label if absent.
5. **git_remotes_ci** -- check for a `.git` directory and at least one CI config file
   (`.github/workflows/*`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.circleci/config.yml`,
   `azure-pipelines.yml`). Status is `fail` when no `.git` directory is found, `partial` when
   `.git` is present but no CI config file is found, and `pass` when both are present.
6. **docs** -- check for `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, or ADR files.

Record each check's `name` (matching exactly: `languages`, `tools`, `smoke_parse`,
`house_rules`, `git_remotes_ci`, `docs`) and `status` (`pass`, `partial`, or `fail`) regardless
of outcome.

## Step 2: Assign per-skill verdicts

Using the check results, assign each downstream skill a verdict in
`{"Ready", "Ready-with-gaps", "Not-ready"}`:

- `befund-ci-topology` is `Not-ready` if `git_remotes_ci`'s status is `fail` (no `.git`
  directory found) -- the skill's own rule refuses to run outside git.
- `befund-ui-audit` is `Ready-with-gaps` (never `Not-ready`) when no UI files are found --
  it degrades to "Not applicable" itself, this skill just flags the gap in advance.
- Any skill whose language was detected only via extension count (not manifest) is
  `Ready-with-gaps`.
- Everything else with a passing smoke-parse and detected language is `Ready`.

## Step 3: Validate before writing

Build `preflight_summary.json` with top-level `checks` (list of the 6 results above) and
`verdicts` (map of skill id to verdict), then validate it before writing:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" validate-artifact --kind preflight_summary --file <path-or-inline-json>
```

This rejects the artifact if any of the 6 required checks is missing or any verdict is outside
the three allowed values -- it is not enough to intend to run all 6 checks, the validator
confirms all 6 are actually present.

Two worked instances of `preflight_summary.json`. All 6 checks passing:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {"name": "languages", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "tools", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "smoke_parse", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "house_rules", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "git_remotes_ci", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "docs", "status": "pass"}
  ],
  "verdicts": {
    "befund-arch-health": "Ready",
    "befund-ci-topology": "Ready",
    "befund-ui-audit": "Ready"
  }
}
```

With a gap -- no `.git` directory found, so `git_remotes_ci` is `fail` and
`befund-ci-topology` drops to `Not-ready` per Step 2's rule, while unrelated skills stay
`Ready`:

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {"name": "languages", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "tools", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "smoke_parse", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "house_rules", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "git_remotes_ci", "status": "fail"},
    {"name": "docs", "status": "pass"}
  ],
  "verdicts": {
    "befund-arch-health": "Ready",
    "befund-ci-topology": "Not-ready",
    "befund-ui-audit": "Ready"
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Write outputs

Resolve both output paths first:

```
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename PREFLIGHT.md
python3 -B "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/befund_cli.py" resolve-output-path --repo <repo_root> --filename preflight_summary.json
```

A non-zero exit here means the configured `output_dir` or filename escapes the plugin's write
scope -- stop, do not write anywhere else instead. On success, write `PREFLIGHT.md` (a
human-readable table of the 6 checks and verdicts) and `preflight_summary.json` to the resolved
paths using the Write tool.

## Read-only constraint

This skill never uses Write/Edit for anything except the two output files above, and never runs
Bash with a mutating flag. All 6 checks are read-only inspection.
