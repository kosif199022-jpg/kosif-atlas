# CMUX Reuse Surface: send a follow-up INTO the surface a session already lives
# in, instead of opening a new one.
#
# On first contact a cmux call lands the callee's claude session in a visible
# side-by-side (or windowed) surface and leaves it open. That surface holds a
# LIVE, idle claude REPL for that exact session. So a follow-up doesn't need to
# `claude --resume` in a fresh surface (which stacks N surfaces over N turns) —
# it pastes the next message into the REPL that's already sitting there.
#
# This script:
#   1. Verifies the stored surface still exists (the user may have closed it).
#   2. Pastes the message dial.sh built — for a follow-up, the
#      `/hotline:hotline-ringing [FOLLOW_UP] …` invocation — into it, with a fresh
#      [CALL_ID:] nonce injected.
#   3. Returns a call_dir wired exactly like cmux-call-async.sh's surface mode,
#      so wait-for-response.sh polls THIS surface and — thanks to the fresh
#      nonce — ignores the prior exchange's stale STATUS lines in scrollback.
#
# If the surface is gone, emits {"fallback":"fresh"} so the caller opens a new
# surface via cmux-call-async.sh --resume instead.
#
# No --resume / no relaunch: the live REPL IS the session. Re-launching claude
# inside it would nest a second REPL.
#
# Usage:
#   cmux-reuse-surface.sh --surface <uuid-or-ref> --session <id>
#                         (--prompt <text> | --prompt-file <path>)
#                         [--cwd <path>] [--keep-workspace]
#   # → {"call_dir": "/tmp/hotline-call-XXXXX"}   (reused, delivery confirmed)
#   # → {"fallback": "fresh", "reason": "..."}     (refused BEFORE anything was sent)
#   # → {"undelivered": true, "reason": "...", "call_dir": …, "prompt_file": …}
#         the paste went out and could not be confirmed. NOT a fallback: the
#         payload may have landed, so re-delivering would run it twice.
#
# --cwd is the CALLEE session's working directory. It lets wait-for-response.sh
# derive the callee's JSONL transcript path and read the response from structured
# data instead of scraping the screen (its preferred path). Omitting it still
# works — wait-for-response falls back to screen-scraping.
#
# ONE DELIVERY PATH, whatever the payload's size or shape: cmux-paste.sh pastes it
# over cmux's control socket — as two pastes for a slash command with a body, which
# is every [FOLLOW_UP] invocation, exactly as for first contact — and then proves
# the nonce reached the callee.
#
# Size- or shape-dependent delivery is off the table, and so is `cmux send` as the
# carrier: it interprets \n/\r/\t with no escape hatch and drops contiguous bytes
# mid-payload with no error — a verified 3,045-byte payload lost 2,538 of them. The
# socket paste has neither failure mode, so the payload itself rides the wire and
# lands in the callee's transcript, where a human reading the session (and the
# switchboard) can see what was actually asked. No sidecar file for the callee to go
# read, no preview to mistake for the request, no size threshold to tune
# (claude-plugins-i8fb).
#
# The one hazard still handled below (claude-plugins-06ws): the input-box clear is
# a raw Ctrl-C byte, which is a real interrupt. It is sent only when the box
# demonstrably holds unsent text AND the REPL shows no sign of an active turn.
#
# "Demonstrably" excludes a PLACEHOLDER. Claude Code draws its ghost suggested
# prompt, its queued-messages hint and `Message @agent…` from a placeholder prop
# while the input's value is empty, and a plain-text screen read cannot tell any of
# them from typed text. Such a box is treated as empty — no Ctrl-C, no verify, paste
# straight in — because that is what it is (claude-plugins-ff6g). The judgement comes
# from repl-state.sh's input_box_is_placeholder, which reads the styled render grid
# and fails closed: anything it cannot prove is a placeholder is handled as real
# unsent text.
#
# New call caches pass a stable surface UUID. Positional surface:N refs can
# silently retarget after a tab move or sibling close; they remain accepted only
# for backward compatibility with caches written by older plugin versions.

# crashed, or the user reused the pane for something else, the surface is alive
# and its cached handle still resolves — but what is drawn is a SHELL PROMPT. None
# of the gates below notice: repl_is_interrupted looks for interrupt wording,
# input_box_content would report the prompt line as parked text at most, and
# repl_looks_busy looks for a spinner.
#
# The consequence is not a lost message. `terminal.paste` with submit_key:"return"
# would type the whole work order at that shell and press Enter, and the shell
# would run it — every line, as a command. So box presence is a hard gate, checked
# before anything else touches this surface.
#
# THE BOX GATE GETS A TIGHTER WINDOW THAN THE OTHER GATES ($SCREEN is the live
# screen; $BOX_TAIL is the bottom of it). repl_box_present matches anywhere in what
# it is handed, panes are not all one height, and a window reaching past the live
# screen is reading HISTORY — where a dead REPL's last frame still holds its
# NBSP-padded box render, with the shell prompt that replaced it sitting below. That
# combination passes an anywhere-in-one-pane-height check and hands the work order
# to the shell. $BOX_TAIL is therefore the SMALLER of the 12-row constant and the
# pane's measured height, so on a 4-row pane the gate sees 4 rows and not 8 rows of
# history (repl_box_tail_lines). Every other gate below wants the wider window: a
# spinner, interrupt wording or a nonce that is really there but a few rows up must
# not read as absent, and each of those errs toward refusing reuse.

# (2/2); and it sometimes silently fails to fire at all. Meanwhile text+Enter into
# a busy REPL is SAFE — the message is enqueued and delivered at the next tool
# boundary or flushed after the turn ends. So the interrupt is what we withhold,
# not the message.
#
# The clear is not simply deleted: leftover text in the box would prepend to our

# make that surface permanently unreusable (the leftover never goes away) —
