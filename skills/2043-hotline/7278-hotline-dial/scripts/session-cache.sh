# Session Cache: Track Agent A's outgoing connections
#
# Stores session maps in ~/.agents-hotline/sessions/<caller-session>.json
# Keyed by Agent A's session ID to prevent collisions.
#
# Usage:
#   session-cache.sh get <target-path> --caller-session <id>
#   session-cache.sh set <target-path> --caller-session <id> --session <id> --mode <mode> [--surface <ref>] [--call-id <id>] [--call-dir <path>] [--transport <name>] [--remote <ssh-target>]
#   session-cache.sh update <target-path> --caller-session <id> [--session <id>] [--surface <ref> | --clear-surface] [--call-id <id>] [--call-dir <path>] [--transport <name>] [--remote <ssh-target>]
#   session-cache.sh forget <target-path> --caller-session <id>
#   session-cache.sh list --caller-session <id>
#
# --surface records the opaque HOST HANDLE the callee's session lives in, so a
# follow-up can re-address that live callee instead of starting a second one. The
# JSON key remains surface_ref for backward compatibility, and the handle is
# per-transport — one field, because every consumer treats it as opaque:
#   cmux  — a surface handle (a stable UUID from side-by-side launchers; older
#           caches may hold a positional surface:N ref).
#   herdr — the agent NAME, which is what `agent prompt` / `agent wait` /
#           `agent get` address and what survives a disconnect.
# Optional — absent for headless calls and for cmux detached placements, neither
# of which leaves a host a follow-up can route into.
#
# --session on `update` RE-KEYS the callee session id. Omitted → untouched, which
# is right for the common follow-up that continued the cached session. It is
# needed when a follow-up ends up on a DIFFERENT session than the cached one: a
# herdr follow-up whose agent has died falls back to a fresh launch, and herdr
# cannot re-host an existing claude session, so the new callee has a new id.
# Leaving the old one there would point the next follow-up at a session nothing is
# listening on, and every answer would be read from a transcript that stopped
# growing.
#
# --clear-surface (update only) REMOVES surface_ref. An empty/omitted --surface
# means "leave it untouched", which is right when a caller simply has nothing
# new to say about the surface — but wrong when the caller KNOWS the session no
# longer occupies one (a follow-up that fell back to headless, or whose side
# placement degraded to detached). Leaving the old ref there sends the next
# follow-up typing into a surface this session has left (claude-plugins-2caw).
#
# --call-id records the per-call nonce of the most recent exchange as
# last_call_id. Cleanup needs it as proof of identity: a superseded surface is
# only safe to close if its scrollback still carries the nonce of the exchange
# it hosted, which distinguishes "the pane hotline used" from "a pane the user
# has since repurposed".
#
# --call-dir records that exchange's call dir as last_call_dir, which is the only
# way a LATER dial can ask what the PREVIOUS one is still doing. It matters for one
# state: a detached callee's tab auto-closes the moment its own response wait
# finishes, so a follow-up pasted into that tab while the wait is still running is
# enqueued behind the live turn and then destroyed with the tab — the message is
# lost and the follow-up's own waiter polls a dead surface to its budget. The call
# dir answers it directly: `done` in there means that wait has finished
# (claude-plugins-zaus). Optional, and absent on every entry written before it
# existed, which reads as "nothing known about the prior exchange".
#
# --transport / --remote say WHICH BACKEND, AND WHICH BOX, the cached host handle
# belongs to — written as `transport` and `remote`, both OPTIONAL and both ABSENT on
# a local cmux entry, which is what every entry written before hotline 0.31.0 is.
#
# They exist because surface_ref is opaque BY DESIGN and a follow-up re-addresses it
# by name: a cmux surface handle and a herdr agent name are indistinguishable
# strings, and a herdr agent name on box A is indistinguishable from one on box B.
# Without these two fields a plain `--transport herdr` dial into a workspace a
# `--remote` dial had cached would hand the LOCAL herdr a remote agent's name, be
# told "no such agent", and quietly fall back to a fresh callee — losing the
# conversation while the real one keeps running, unreachable, on the other box
# (claude-plugins-7wze.11). dial.sh compares them and declines the reuse instead.
#
# READ BACKWARD-COMPATIBLY, ALWAYS. An entry with neither field means what it has
# always meant — a LOCAL callee on whatever transport the dial is using now — and
# `get` returns it unchanged. Nothing is migrated and no entry is invalidated.
