# CMUX Call (Async): Launch an interactive claude session inside a cmux
# workspace and return immediately. The caller drives polling for session-id
# and response through wait-for-session.sh / wait-for-response.sh — those
# scripts run as children of the caller's bash (which is cmux-spawned via
# claude's Bash tool), so they retain cmux ancestry and `cmux read-screen`
# works. This script does NOT background a poller of its own: under cmux's
# default access_mode=cmuxOnly, a detached subshell reparents to PID 1 and
# every `cmux` call returns "Broken pipe", silently breaking detection.
#
# Same call_dir interface as headless-call-async.sh:
#   transport.txt        — 'cmux'. The explicit backend signal the wait-for-*
#                          scripts read first; coarse (it names the backend, not the
#                          sub-mode), so placement.txt below picks the cmux one.
#   placement.txt        — 'side' | 'detached' | 'window': which cmux placement
#                          HOSTS this call, written once the placement is FINAL
#                          (so a side-by-side that degraded reads 'detached').
#                          This is the sub-mode signal — which host the waiters
#                          poll, and which verb closes it. It used to be inferred
#                          from which ref file existed, which meant a detached
#                          call could not record its surface without being read
#                          as a side placement (claude-plugins-zaus). Read via
#                          call_dir_placement (scripts/transport.sh).
#   degraded.txt         — present only when side-by-side degraded to detached
#                          because the caller's own surface context was
#                          unresolvable; holds the fallback name dial.sh records.
#   workspace_ref.txt    — the cmux workspace ref, for a DETACHED call: the tab
#                          the callee lives in, and what its cleanup closes.
#   workspace_id.txt     — that workspace as a UUID, for calls that must scope a
#                          close (`cmux close-surface` needs --workspace).
#   surface_ref.txt      — the surface UUID hosting the callee's REPL. Present
#                          for EVERY placement that resolved one, detached
#                          included: it is the handle a follow-up re-addresses
#                          instead of opening another tab.
#   session_id_preset.txt — the UUID we passed to `claude --session-id`,
#                          confirmed by wait-for-session.sh when the splash
#                          banner appears (then promoted to session_id.txt)
#   launch_script.txt    — absolute path of the launch script. Starts as the
#                          /tmp/hotline-launch-* file the callee's shell execs;
#                          wait-for-session.sh moves that into the call dir as
#                          launch_script.sh once boot confirms and repoints this,
#                          and wait-for-response.sh removes whatever it names
#                          after STATUS. A boot that FAILED leaves the /tmp path
#                          in place — the diagnostic tells the user to re-send it
#                          by hand — and the age sweep below reaps those.
#   pending_paste.md     — the prompt, 0600, awaiting delivery into the booted
#                          REPL by cmux-paste.sh. Present in cmux surface/workspace
#                          mode only; its presence is the signal to the caller
#                          that a delivery step is still owed (see below).
#   keep_workspace.txt   — 'true'/'false'; if true, wait-for-response.sh
#                          leaves the workspace open after STATUS (used by
#                          conference-call mode handed off to the user)
#   session_id.txt       — written by wait-for-session.sh after it observes
#                          the Claude Code REPL banner
#   response.json        — written by wait-for-response.sh after STATUS:
#                          {"session_id":"..","response":".."}
#   done                 — empty sentinel written by wait-for-response.sh
#   error.txt            — written by this script on early failures
#                          (new-workspace fail, send fail)
#
# THE PROMPT IS NOT LAUNCHED WITH CLAUDE. This script starts a BARE `claude`
# REPL and leaves the prompt in pending_paste.md for cmux-paste.sh to deliver
# once the REPL's input box is up. It used to pass the prompt as claude's
# positional argument, which put whole work orders in an argv every local user
# can read out of `ps` (claude-plugins-86ka) — and meant first contact and
# follow-ups used two entirely different delivery mechanisms, only one of which
# was ever verified byte-exact. Now both paste over the control socket.
#
# The caller owes the delivery step: launch here, boot wait (wait-for-session.sh),
# then paste. That ordering is why the prompt cannot be delivered from inside this
# script — it returns before the REPL exists.
#
# Usage:
#   cmux-call-async.sh --cwd <path> (--prompt <text> | --prompt-file <path>)
#                      [--resume <id>] [--name <name>] [--label <text>]
#                      [--fork-session] [--tools <list>] [--keep-workspace]
#   # Returns immediately with: {"call_dir": "/tmp/hotline-call-xxxxx"}
#
# --prompt-file is preferred: it keeps the payload out of argv end to end.

Usage: cmux-call-async.sh --cwd <path> --prompt <text> [--resume <id>]
                          [--name <name>] [--label <text>] [--fork-session]
                          [--tools <list>] [--keep-workspace]

Opens an interactive claude session in a cmux workspace and returns immediately
with {"call_dir": "/tmp/hotline-call-XXXXX"}. The caller then drives polling
via wait-for-session.sh and wait-for-response.sh — those scripts read
placement.txt from the call_dir to learn which cmux host this call landed on,
and poll that surface or workspace screen directly (they retain cmux ancestry,
this script's background subshell would not).

Options:
  --label <text>     What the callee is DOING. Used as the workspace name for
                     --detached; a surface placement reads it off --name, which
                     claude emits as its own live terminal title.
  --tools <list>     Allowed tools (default: "Bash Read Edit Write Grep Glob")
  --keep-workspace   Do not close the cmux workspace after STATUS. Used by
                     conference-call mode to hand the workspace off to the
                     user. wait-for-response.sh reads keep_workspace.txt.

To enable --dangerously-skip-permissions on the receiver (autonomous calls
into a trusted local workspace), set HOTLINE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=1
(or true/yes) in your env. See README for the trade-off.

# Determine the session ID upfront. We don't write it to session_id.txt yet —

#
# cmux mode has no structured output to read the real session ID back from
# (headless parses it out of stream-json), so the preset must be *authoritative*
# — whatever we record here is what the wait-for-* scripts will treat as the
# callee's session. Three cases:
#
#   First contact (no --resume): generate a fresh UUID and pass it to claude via
#   --session-id so the transcript is written under our chosen ID.
#
#   Fork (--resume + --fork-session): the fork writes to a NEW session, so the
#   resume target is NOT where the transcript lands. Generate a fresh UUID and
#   pass it via --session-id — that is the only way to know the fork's ID.
#
#   Plain resume (--resume alone): the session already exists and keeps its ID —
#   use RESUME_ID and do NOT pass --session-id (claude rejects that combination).
#
# The CLI states the rule itself: "--session-id can only be used with --continue
# or --resume if --fork-session is also specified." So --session-id is REQUIRED
