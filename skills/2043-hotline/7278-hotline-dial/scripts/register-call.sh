# Register Call: Record a call in the sessions registry from call_dir metadata,
# and log it to the receiver's dial history.
#
# Reads session_id.txt plus the meta files written by persist-call-meta.sh
# (cwd.txt, mode.txt, caller_cwd.txt, caller_session.txt) and runs
# session-cache.sh set. Called by wait-for-session.sh the moment the remote
# session ID is known, and by cmux-call.sh for synchronous conference calls — so
# the registry is written by scripts, not by agent discipline.
#
# Dial history is written here too, for the same reason plus one more: the
# receiving agent used to run dial-history.sh itself (per the ringing skill),
# but that script lives in the CALLER's plugin install dir, which the ringing
# skill's own workspace-isolation rule forbids the receiver from touching. A
# receiver that obeyed isolation skipped logging; one that logged broke
# isolation. The caller has every field the entry needs, so it writes it.
#
# Usage:
#   register-call.sh <call_dir>
#
# Silent no-op (exit 0) when any required metadata is missing, so callers
# never fail on it. Set HOTLINE_DEBUG=1 to see why a registration was skipped.

# transports:
#   cmux  — surface_ref.txt, present for every placement whose surface could be
#           resolved, DETACHED included: a detached callee lives in one surface
#           inside its own workspace tab, and until that handle was recorded here
#           every follow-up into it opened another tab (claude-plugins-zaus).
#           Absent for headless calls, and for a cmux launch whose tree read failed.
#   herdr — herdr_agent.txt, the agent NAME, which is what `agent prompt` /
#           `agent wait` / `agent get` address and what survives a disconnect.
# Only one is ever present: the launchers write one file each, keyed by transport.

# wrong kind is told "no such agent" and quietly starts a second callee while the
# real one keeps running somewhere unreachable (claude-plugins-7wze.11). Recorded
# from FIRST CONTACT, here, because that is where the entry is created; both fields
# are omitted when there is nothing to say, so a local cmux entry keeps exactly the
