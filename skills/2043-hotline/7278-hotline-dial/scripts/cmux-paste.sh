# CMUX Paste: deliver a payload into a live claude REPL and PROVE it landed.
#
# The one delivery verb hotline uses over the cmux transport, for first contact
# and for follow-ups alike. Both callers hand it a file and a nonce; it resolves
# the surface's cmux address, pastes the file's bytes in a single
# `terminal.paste` RPC over the control socket, and then confirms the nonce
# reached the callee.
#
# WHY A SOCKET PASTE AND NOT `cmux send`:
#   • `cmux send` interprets \n, \r and \t in its text argument with no escape
#     hatch, so a payload had to be SPLIT to survive it (claude-plugins-nofy),
#     and it is sporadically lossy in ways that are not size-gated — a verified
#     3,045-byte payload lost 2,538 contiguous bytes with no error at all.
#   • `cmux rpc` would carry the paste, but takes its params as an argv string,
#     publishing whole work orders to `ps` (claude-plugins-86ka).
#   terminal.paste over the socket has neither problem: one request line, the
#   payload JSON-escaped in-process from a file. Measured 12/12 byte-exact to
#   16KB, and 18/18 multi-line trials landed as exactly ONE user turn.
#
# TWO LANDING SHAPES, both of which mean success:
#   idle REPL  → the payload is submitted and written as ONE user turn.
#   busy REPL  → it is QUEUED and written as a `queued_command` attachment, with
#                no user turn at all, and flushed at the next tool boundary.
#   A verifier that only counted user turns would read a landed queued paste as
#   lost and re-send it. Both shapes are accepted below.
#
# Usage:
#   cmux-paste.sh --surface <handle> --payload-file <path> --call-id <nonce>
#                 [--cwd <callee-cwd>] [--session <callee-session-id>]
#                 [--wait-box <seconds>] [--workspace <uuid>] [--baseline <path>]
#
#   # → {"delivered":true,"sent":true,"confirmed":"transcript"|"screen","workspace":"…","surface":"…"}
#   # → {"delivered":false,"sent":false,"reason":"…"}   nothing left this machine
#   # → {"delivered":false,"sent":true,"reason":"…"}    the socket took it; landing unproven
#
# Always exits 0 with JSON: whether a failed delivery means "fall back to a
# fresh surface" or "fail the dial" is the caller's decision, not this script's.
#
# `sent` is what makes that decision safe. delivered:false with sent:false means
# the callee received nothing, so delivering somewhere else is fine. delivered:false
# with sent:TRUE means the payload may already be in the callee's input queue and
# only the confirmation missed — re-delivering it runs the work order twice.
#
# --wait-box polls until the REPL has drawn its input box. This is not politeness
# about a slow boot: a payload delivered to a surface that has not exec'd claude
# does not vanish, it goes to whatever IS there, and a shell with
# submit_key:"return" RUNS it. First contact waits; a follow-up whose caller has
# already proven the box on its own screen read passes 0.
#
# --workspace lets a caller that already walked the cmux tree hand over the
# workspace UUID instead of making this script walk it again.
#
# --baseline names a file holding the pre-paste screen. Confirmation needs to know
# which screen markers were ALREADY there, so a previous exchange's chrome cannot
# confirm this delivery (see the screen tier below). Without it, one read is taken
# here.

# out its whole budget for a box that has been drawn the entire time, refusing a
# delivery that was perfectly safe. `--scrollback --lines N` returns the live tail
# regardless of scroll position (repl-state.sh; verified on cmux 0.64.22).
#
# The result is TAILED to the live screen rows before any state judgement reads it.
# Box presence, busy markers and box content are all bottom-of-screen facts, and a
# 400-line read still holds `❯` echoes and elapsed-time parentheticals from turns
# that ended long ago — matching those would report a box (or a busy REPL) that is
# not there now. The scrollback width only exists so the read cannot be scrolled
# out from under us, not to widen what these predicates see.
#
# HOW MANY ROWS "THE LIVE SCREEN" IS, is measured where it can be — but NOT during
# the box wait below. cmux_screen_rows counts the rows a bare read returns

# already drawn. During --wait-box the REPL is still coming up: a measurement taken
# then reports the two or three rows a shell has printed, and every window derived
# from it would stay that narrow for the rest of the call — the box gate would never
# see the box it is waiting for (hard timeout on a healthy boot) and the baseline
# would be nearly empty, which makes every generic screen marker look FRESH and
# confirms deliveries that never landed. So the loop runs on the 60-row constant,
# exactly as before, and the measurement happens once the box is proven.

# --- Deliver the paste(s). ---------------------------------------------------
# ONE paste for an ordinary payload; TWO for a first-contact slash command whose
# body would otherwise sink the whole invocation.
#
# One paste, submit_key "return": submits an idle REPL and queues against a busy
# one; cmux upgrades it to ctrl+enter itself for multi-line Claude payloads, so
# there is no per-payload choice to make in that case.
#
# TWO pastes — the first-contact slash case (claude-plugins-pmgb). CC's TUI
# collapses any single paste over ~800 chars or 3 lines into a
# `[Pasted text +N lines]` placeholder. When that placeholder is the START of the
# input the leading `/` is gone, the slash command never parses, and the callee
# gets the work order as PLAIN TEXT with no ringing protocol — no STATUS, no
# call_id — so the caller's wait-for-response misreads the silence as a reassigned
# callee. Delivering the invocation line in its own small paste keeps the buffer
# starting with `/` so the command parses; the body rides a second paste whose
# placeholder CC expands back inside the command args on submit (probe-verified
# live on CC 2.1.226: slash parsed AND every body marker present in
# <command-args>, both when the body was glued to the invocation and when it sat
# on its own line below it). The split fires only for a slash-command first line
# that HAS a body beneath it — first contact, and every interactive follow-up,
# which dial.sh sends as a `[FOLLOW_UP]` invocation (claude-plugins-2i6g). Anything
# else takes the one-paste path unchanged.
#
# The two-paste sequence does NOT let either paste submit (submit_key none); a
# real Enter KEY EVENT after both land is what submits, because it arrives outside
# the bracketed paste (phase-2 + the pmgb probe both confirmed this submits the
# whole box as one turn where an in-paste submit key would not).

# SECONDARY — the screen. For a callee whose cwd/session we were not told, or a
# transcript that has not flushed yet. Four acceptances, and all four must stay:
#   • the nonce itself — a short payload renders in the box verbatim.
#   • "[Pasted text"   — a large paste collapses to a placeholder, so the nonce
#                        is genuinely not on screen even though it landed. Counts
#                        only OUTSIDE the input box (see below): in the box, the
#                        placeholder means the payload arrived and never submitted.
#   • "Press up to edit queued" — the REPL was busy and queued it. That IS
#                        delivery; claude flushes it at the next tool boundary. The
#                        one marker that also counts ON the box line, because claude
#                        draws it there as a placeholder (see QUEUED_HINT below).
#   • "Jump to bottom" — a BACKSTOP, not the main defence. Every read here is
#                        scroll-immune (read_live), so a scrolled pane returns the
#                        live tail and this marker should not appear at all. It is
#                        kept because absence of the nonce on a capture we somehow
#                        cannot trust proves nothing, and re-sending on that
#                        reading is a documented double-submit.
#
# THE LAST THREE NEED A RECENCY BASELINE. They are generic chrome, and the whole
# point of this path is that the surface is REUSED — so a previous exchange's
# `[Pasted text +40 lines]`, or a "Press up to edit queued messages" from a
# follow-up two turns ago, is very often still in the viewport. Matched blind,
# each of them confirms a paste that never arrived, which is worse than no check
# at all: the caller then blocks on wait-for-response until it times out.
#
# So a marker only counts if it is ABSENT from the pre-paste baseline. The nonce
# needs no such treatment — it is minted for this delivery and cannot be stale.
#
# AND EVERY ACCEPTANCE IS SCOPED TO THE SCREEN OUTSIDE THE LIVE INPUT BOX. A
# marker on the box line proves the payload ARRIVED; it says nothing about whether
# it SUBMITTED, and the two are exactly what this tier has to tell apart. `❯ [Pasted
# text #2 +6 lines]` sitting in the box IS the unsubmitted state — the same state
# payload_is_parked classifies below — so counting it here confirms a delivery that
# is still waiting for its Enter, and the parked-retry path never runs
# (claude-plugins-y4rl). A marker rendered elsewhere — a scrollback echo of a
# submitted turn, the scrolled-viewport banner — carries information about
# submission; box CONTENT does not.

# box that is showing it, and the hint's presence proves the queue is non-empty. The

#   busy / queued  → already submitted (phase-2); an Enter would submit the NEXT
#                    thing, not this one. Never parked.
#   interrupted    → an Enter answers the "what should Claude do instead?" prompt.
#   empty box      → the payload left the box (submitted). Nothing to resend.
#   foreign box text — a ghost suggested-prompt like `push it` (claude-plugins-ff6g)
#                    that reappears in an emptied box after a submit — is not ours;
#                    firing Enter on it would submit a phantom turn.
# "Ours" is the nonce on the box line (a small paste, including the [CALL_ID:] line
# a collapsed multi-line follow-up leaves as its first box line) or a `[Pasted text`
# placeholder ON the box line.
#   scrolled viewport ("Jump to bottom") → a capture we cannot trust as the live box.
#                    read_live is scroll-immune, so this should not be reachable;
#                    kept as a backstop because if it ever IS, then
#                    input_box_content's bare-`❯` fallback (repl-state.sh) could
#                    match a prior turn's "❯ [Pasted text #1 …" from history and we
#                    would fire Enter blind into the unseen live box — where a ghost
#                    suggested-prompt becomes a phantom turn (ff6g). Absence of the

#   box unchanged from the baseline — whatever is in there was in there BEFORE this
#                    paste, so it is not ours and an Enter would submit someone
#                    else's text. Reuse clears a dirty box and proves the clear took
#                    before pasting, and first contact waits for a freshly-drawn box,
#                    so in practice this only fires when the paste has not rendered
#                    yet — which is indistinguishable from "not ours" from here.

# in the box is the parked state; `[Pasted text` in the scrollback is a submitted
# turn. When a tier that concludes "delivered" runs before the tier that concludes
# "arrived but never submitted", the false positive wins and the retry never fires —
# observed live on a reused surface at ~5% (claude-plugins-y4rl, recurrence of
# claude-plugins-fkgv). So the NEGATIVE interpretation is tested first: parked is a
# strictly stronger, box-scoped read of the same screen.
#
# Ordering it first is safe against submitting a payload twice because the box was
# proven EMPTY before this paste went out — cmux-reuse-surface.sh refuses to paste
# onto parked text and re-reads the box to prove its clear worked, and a first-contact
# REPL has never been typed into. So `[Pasted text` or our nonce in the box after the
# paste is OUR payload, not a leftover an Enter would submit instead.
