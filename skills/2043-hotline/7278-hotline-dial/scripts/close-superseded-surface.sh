# =============================================================================
# Close a superseded hotline surface.
#
# When a follow-up cannot reuse the surface its session was living in, it opens a
# new one and resumes the session there. `claude --resume` takes the session over,
# so the OLD surface is left holding a REPL that will never be spoken to again —
# and nothing used to close it, so a long exchange accumulated one dead tab per
# turn.
#
# Closing a surface KILLS its foreground process (verified: a `sleep 400` in the
# closed surface was reaped). So this refuses unless all of these hold:
#
#   1. The handle is a stable UUID, not a positional `surface:N` ref.
#   2. The surface is still readable.
#   3. Its scrollback carries --expect-call-id, the nonce of the exchange it
#      hosted. This is the identity proof: it distinguishes "the pane hotline was
#      using" from "a pane the user has since repurposed". Without it a recycled
#      handle could point anywhere.
#   4. A claude REPL is still drawn there at all. If claude has exited, the
#      foreground process this would kill is a SHELL — and the pane still carries
#      our nonce in its scrollback, so every other check happily agrees.
#   5. Its REPL is not mid-turn — no in-flight markers, and a screen that has not
#      changed across a short window.
#   6. It is not sitting in the post-interrupt "what should Claude do instead?"
#      state, where a human is mid-decision.
#   7. Its input box holds no unsent text. Reuse refuses to type over parked
#      text; closing would delete it, which is worse. A box holding Claude Code's
#      PLACEHOLDER — the ghost suggested prompt, the queued-messages hint,
#      `Message @agent…` — is an empty box wearing text and does not count; that
#      judgement comes from the styled render grid and fails closed.
#
# Every refusal is a reason string, never an error: cleanup failing to run must
# not fail the dial that triggered it.
#
# Usage:
#   close-superseded-surface.sh --surface <handle> --expect-call-id <nonce>
#                               [--settle <seconds>]
#   # → {"closed": true,  "surface": "...", "workspace": "..."}
#   # → {"closed": false, "reason": "..."}
#
# HOTLINE_CLOSE_SUPERSEDED=0 disables cleanup entirely (reason: disabled).
#
# NEVER target a surface by tty: cmux recycles tty numbers, so a stale tty can
# name a completely different pane by the time this runs. Handles only.
#
# `cmux close-surface` needs BOTH --workspace and --surface even when given a
# surface UUID: with --surface alone it fails "Surface not found: <uuid>" for a
# surface that read-screen reads happily in the same breath (verified live, cmux
# 0.64.20 — the error means "not resolvable in the current workspace context").
# The workspace is resolved from the tree rather than stored, so this works for a
# cache written before the workspace was ever recorded.

# Identity and liveness ask two different questions of the same capture. Identity

# from turns that ended long ago.
#

# the surface is CURRENTLY SHOWING, so a user scrolled up inside the pane froze the
# capture — and the "screen unchanged ⇒ idle" test below cannot fail against a
# frozen capture, because it never differs from itself. This script CLOSES the
# surface it judges, killing the foreground process, so that test passing spuriously
# meant closing a pane that was mid-turn (claude-plugins-r465.6). `--scrollback
# --lines N` returns the live tail regardless of scroll position (repl-state.sh).

# reads as "idle, safe to close". A fixed 60 rows is too narrow on a tall pane —
# panes of 71 and 83 occupied rows were measured on this machine, and rows 61-83 of
