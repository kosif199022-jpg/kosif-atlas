# Transcript Extract: read a callee's Claude Code JSONL transcript and report,
# for one hotline call (identified by its CALL_ID nonce), whether the message
# submitted and — once the turn completes — the response body.
#
# This replaces terminal screen-scraping. The transcript is the structured
# source of truth: Claude Code flushes one JSON event per line in real time
# (verified live — a mid-turn session's file was <10s stale, ms-timestamped).
# We correlate on the nonce in event DATA, not on rendered pixels, so it's
# immune to REPL chrome (box glyphs, prompt markers, ANSI, spinners) that vary
# by claude version. (claude-plugins-0pwc)
#
# Schema facts this relies on (verified against real transcripts):
#   - `type:"user"` events carry the typed message in `.message.content`, which
#     is EITHER a string (slash-command / raw follow-up) OR an array of blocks
#     (tool results) — so we match the nonce against `.message.content|tostring`.
#   - `type:"assistant"` events carry `.message.content[]` blocks of type
#     `text` | `thinking` | `tool_use`; only `text` blocks are response prose.
#   - `.isSidechain == true` marks subagent turns — excluded so a spawned
#     agent's chatter never pollutes the response.
#   - `.sessionId` is on every event.
#   - A message typed into a REPL that is mid-turn is QUEUED, and claude records
#     that as `type:"queue-operation"` (`operation:"enqueue"`, text in
#     `.content`). See the two delivery paths below.
# The receiver still brackets its answer with the ringing protocol's
# `STATUS: WORK_IN_PROGRESS call_id=<nonce>` … `STATUS: <terminal> call_id=<nonce>`
# sentinels; we apply that same bracketing to the structured text.
#
# Exit codes (the contract wait-for-response.sh polls on):
#   0  — turn complete: prints {"session_id":"…","response":"…"} (compact JSON)
#   10 — submitted (see SUBMIT EVIDENCE) but no terminal STATUS yet
#        → caller keeps waiting patiently (model is working)
#   11 — no submit evidence for the nonce anywhere in the transcript
#        → caller consults the callee's input box before concluding anything
#   12 — PREEMPTED: no terminal STATUS, a genuine human prompt arrived after our
#        turn, and nothing after that prompt names our call_id — so the receiver
#        has been handed something else. The preempting prompt (200 chars) goes to
#        stdout. → caller starts its grace window instead of sitting out the
#        timeout (wait-for-response.sh decides how long to keep polling).
#   13 — AWAITING_REVIEW: this step's reply is complete but the work order is not
#        finished. Same JSON as exit 0 plus `"awaiting_review": true`.
#        → caller stops waiting and keeps the session live for a follow-up.
#   1  — usage / unreadable transcript error (message on stderr)
#
# AWAITING_REVIEW (claude-plugins-n4vy)
# "Is the work finished" and "is the reply ready" are two different facts, and the
# protocol used to have only one word for both. A callee told to do step 1 of 3,
# report, and hold for the lead's review can honestly emit only WORK_IN_PROGRESS —
# the work order IS unfinished — and WORK_IN_PROGRESS is precisely what the caller
# treats as "keep polling". Observed live: the waiter blocked past its 600s tool
# timeout, got backgrounded, and had to be killed while the finished report sat
# complete in the transcript. `STATUS: AWAITING_REVIEW call_id=<nonce>` resolves
# the wait exactly like a terminal status, and the separate exit code plus the
# payload marker tell the caller the surface and session are still live and a
# follow-up is expected. WORK_IN_PROGRESS still means keep polling, unchanged.
#
# PREEMPTION (claude-plugins-dvjo)
# A cmux call lands in a VISIBLE surface, and a visible surface is one the human
# can type into — that is the point of side-by-side placement, not a misuse. Once
# they give that session another task, our STATUS never arrives; waiting out the
# remaining 1800s tells the caller nothing. Counted as preemption: a new human
# prompt (including one typed as a slash command) and `[Request interrupted by
# user…]`. NOT counted: tool_result records (no text blocks), isMeta /
# isSidechain / isCompactSummary / isVisibleInTranscriptOnly records, our own
# nonce turn or a replay of it, and anything BEFORE our nonce turn. Client-side
# commands (/model, /clear) are type:"system" subtype:"local_command" rather than
# user records, so they are out of scope for free — right for /model, a known miss
# for /clear, which the timeout still catches. Claude's local-command wrapper
# records can arrive as type:"user" without isMeta; those begin with
# <local-command-stderr>, <local-command-stdout>, <local-command-caveat>, or
# <task-notification> and are synthetic harness output, not human reassignment.
#
# A MID-CALL REDIRECT IS NOT A REASSIGNMENT (claude-plugins-mrpi)
# The same human who can hand that session another task can also interrupt it to
# STEER the order we sent — and steering produces the identical records: a
# `[Request interrupted by user]` user record plus a correction prompt. The tell
# is what the receiver does next. So: PREEMPTED iff no non-sidechain assistant
# record after the LATEST genuine human prompt carries `STATUS: <anything>
# call_id=<our nonce>` — WORK_IN_PROGRESS included. A re-ack after that prompt
# means the receiver is still on OUR order (exit 10, keep waiting); a newer prompt
# after a re-ack re-opens the question, which is why the anchor is the latest prompt
# and not the first: anchoring on the first would let one re-ack absolve every
# prompt that followed it, permanently masking a real reassignment. It also makes
# the prompt we report the most recent one, which is the one worth showing.
# Observed live 2026-08-18 (call_id a7d57642a858b188): the correction landed, the
# caller exited 3, and the receiver went on to report WORK_COMPLETE for that same
# nonce with nobody listening.
#
# SUBMIT EVIDENCE — WHY A `user` RECORD IS NOT THE ONLY PROOF (claude-plugins-1jpz)
# A message typed into a REPL that is already mid-turn does NOT produce a user
# record at submit time. It is enqueued, and claude then delivers it one of two
# ways (both observed live on 2.1.221):
#   (a) TOOL-BOUNDARY INJECTION — if the busy turn hits another tool call, the
#       queued text is handed to the model INSIDE that same turn as
#       `type:"attachment"` with `.attachment.type == "queued_command"` and the
#       text in `.attachment.prompt` (parentUuid = the tool_result). NO
#       `type:"user"` record is EVER written for it, yet the model reads and
#       answers it — measured 8ms after the boundary.
#   (b) TURN-END FLUSH — if the turn makes no further tool call, the queue drains
#       after it ends as a genuine `type:"user"` record (+5.5s measured).
# Correlating on user records alone therefore reported "never submitted" for
# path (a) messages the receiver had already ANSWERED. So four things count as
# proof, in this precedence order (the winner also anchors where the response
# body starts, so prose from the swallowed prior task cannot leak in):
#   1. a `user` record carrying the nonce            (paths: idle send, and (b))
#   2. a `queued_command` attachment carrying it     (path (a) delivery)
#   3. the receiver's own `STATUS: … call_id=<nonce>` — an answer in hand is
#      proof of receipt no matter which records are missing
#   4. the `enqueue` record — written the instant the REPL accepts the
#      keystrokes, so it proves submit before either path resolves
# 3 is deliberately ranked above 4: it is the later, tighter anchor. The enqueue
# lands mid-prior-turn, so anchoring there would splice that turn's tail onto our
# response body.
#
# WHY THIS STAYS jq AND SELF-CONTAINED (claude-plugins-wn09)
# The obvious-looking cleanup is to retire this in favour of session-tools'
# lib/transcript.mjs. Measured, that is wrong twice over. transcript.mjs applies
# stripSystemNoise to ASSISTANT prose, so a reply that legitimately quotes a
# harness block — "the bug is that <system-reminder>…</system-reminder> leaks into
# the dashboard", an actual hotline answer — comes back with the quote deleted:
# "the bug is that  leaks into the dashboard". Corrupting response bodies to
# de-duplicate a parser is a bad trade. And none of the logic that matters here
# (nonce correlation, STATUS bracketing, WORK_IN_PROGRESS reset) exists in
# transcript.mjs, so the protocol code would stay in hotline anyway while the
# plugin gained a hard dependency on session-tools and stopped installing
# standalone. This file is not a vendored copy of that parser; it is hotline's own
# protocol reader, and it is deliberately noise-preserving.
