# herdr Reuse Agent: send a follow-up INTO the herdr agent a session already
# lives in, instead of starting a second callee.
#
# The herdr counterpart of cmux-reuse-surface.sh, and deliberately a fraction of
# its size. cmux has to RESOLVE a host (a surface handle that can silently
# retarget), prove a claude REPL is still drawn on it, read its input box, and
# sometimes clear that box with a real interrupt — because a cmux surface is a
# rectangle of pixels that anything could have taken over. herdr has none of that
# surface area: the NAMED AGENT IS THE SESSION. `herdr agent prompt <name>`
# re-targets it by name, submission is atomic and bracketed-paste aware, and
# `herdr agent get <name>` answers "is it still there" outright. So this script is
# three steps: probe, submit, prove.
#
# Verified live on herdr 0.8.0, and the reason this path exists at all: a
# follow-up is just another `agent prompt` to the same live name. Context
# continues and BOTH exchanges land in one session and one transcript ("remember
# 42" → later "what number?" → "42"). A finished, unfocused agent reports
# `status: done` rather than `idle` and still re-accepts a prompt.
#
# Usage:
#   herdr-reuse-agent.sh --agent <name> --session <callee-session-id>
#                        (--prompt <text> | --prompt-file <path>)
#                        [--cwd <callee-cwd>]
#   # → {"call_dir":"…","delivery":"prompt","confirmed":"transcript"}
#   #     re-targeted the live agent and proved the payload landed
#   # → {"fallback":"fresh","reason":"…"}
#   #     refused BEFORE anything was submitted, so a fresh launch is safe
#   # → {"undelivered":true,"reason":"…","call_dir":…,"prompt_file":…}
#   #     the submit went out and could not be confirmed. NOT a fallback: the
#   #     payload may already be in the callee's queue, so re-delivering it
#   #     elsewhere would run the work order twice.
#   # → {"blocked":true,"agent":"…","reason":"…"}
#   #     the agent is live but waiting on INPUT. Also NOT a fallback — see below.
#
# --prompt-file is preferred: it keeps the payload out of argv on the way in.
# (The last hop still puts it on argv — `herdr agent prompt` takes its text
# positionally and herdr 0.8.0 offers no file form. See herdr-prompt.sh.)
#
# A FRESH NONCE EVERY TURN, which is the one piece of cmux's reuse machinery that
# does carry over. The callee's transcript keeps every prior exchange's `STATUS:`
# lines, so a follow-up that reused the previous nonce would read the PRIOR turn's
# completion as this one's. Minted through repl-state.sh, same as every launcher.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO — and must not grow:
#   • No superseded-host cleanup. The same agent is reused, so nothing is
#     orphaned and there is nothing to close (close-superseded-surface.sh exists
#     because a cmux follow-up that opened a NEW surface stranded the old one).
#   • No input-box gating, no Ctrl-C, no screen read. herdr cannot see a claude
#     REPL's box at all (alternate-screen TUI) and does not need to: submission is
#     atomic, and a busy callee QUEUES the prompt rather than welding it onto
#     leftover text.
#   • No shaping of the payload. dial.sh hands over the finished message — for an
#     interactive follow-up, the `/hotline:hotline-ringing [FOLLOW_UP] …` invocation
#     — and herdr-prompt.sh splits it exactly as it splits first contact, on the
#     same predicate. A second opinion here about what a follow-up looks like is
#     how the two would drift.
#
# TWO STATES REFUSE THE REUSE, and both refuse before submitting anything — but
# they are NOT the same refusal, and reporting them alike orphaned a live callee:
#
#   gone     — no live agent answers to the name. herdr clears a name when its
#              agent exits, so this is how a dead callee reports itself. Nothing
#              is left holding the prior context, so a fresh callee costs only the
#              conversation that already died with it: {"fallback":"fresh"}.
#
#   blocked  — the callee is waiting on INPUT (a permission gate, or a genuine
#              question). This is the herdr analogue of cmux's post-interrupt
#              "what should Claude do instead?" refusal: a work order submitted
#              into that state ANSWERS the gate instead of starting a turn.
#              {"blocked":true}, NOT a fallback, because that agent is STILL LIVE
#              and still holds the only copy of this conversation. Answering with
#              a fresh callee starts a second one, re-keys the cache to it, and
#              leaves the blocked agent running and unreachable through hotline —
#              while the response wait treats the very same state as "a human must
#              look" (exit 5, resumable). One state, two verdicts, is the bug
#              (claude-plugins-7wze.13). dial.sh fails the dial instead.
#
# CONFIRMED WITH A SECOND READ before either verdict is returned. `blocked` can be
# a blink — a gate the callee's own hook answered a moment later — and now that it
# ENDS the dial rather than degrading it, a flicker would fail a follow-up that had
# nothing wrong with it. The response wait confirms for exactly this reason
# (blocked_confirmed in wait-for-response.sh); this is the same rule at the other
# end of the call.
