# Surface Ready: block until a freshly-created cmux terminal surface (or a
# workspace's current surface) has its PTY attached AND its shell is actually
# executing input.
#
# `cmux send` is what attaches a surface's PTY — lazily, on the first send. That
# is the whole mechanism, and it is why this script's probe IS the attachment
# step rather than something that waits for one:
#
#   1. "Terminal surface not found" / "Failed to read terminal text" — every
#      `cmux read-screen` fails until something has sent to the surface.
#      Verified on cmux 0.64.22: a surface created with --focus false answers
#      `Error: internal_error: Failed to read terminal text` before its first
#      send and reads fine straight after one. So a readiness wait built on
#      read-screen alone can never succeed; the send has to come first.
#   2. Swallowed `\n` (fresh-PTY race) — the shell's startup banner ("Last
#      login: …") can print AFTER our typed command, eating the trailing
#      newline so `send "bash launch\n"` types the command but never runs it.
#      We round-trip an `echo <marker>` probe and re-send it periodically until
#      the marker appears as command OUTPUT (>=2 on-screen hits: the typed input
#      line + the executed echo line), proving the shell actually ran input.
#
# FOCUS IS NOT PART OF THIS. `cmux focus-pane` also attaches the PTY, eagerly,
# but it does so by MOVING THE USER'S FOCUS — and a user typing at that moment
# has their keystrokes land in the callee's shell, which is how a launch command
# became `rkebash /tmp/…` (2026-08-26). Focus buys ~0.1s and costs the user's
# input line, so this script never takes it (claude-plugins-r465.4).
#
# NET-NEW hotline infrastructure: the side-by-side path delegates entirely to
# cmux-cli's open-side-surface.sh (which has its own --wait-ready), but the
# --window and --detached placement paths are hotline-only — cmux-cli offers no
# standalone readiness helper for a surface or workspace we created ourselves. So
# this script exists to give both of them the same PTY-readiness guarantee. The
# probe algorithm mirrors cmux-cli's --wait-ready by necessity (it's the only
# correct way to detect a swallowed \n), but there is no callable cmux-cli
# equivalent to reuse here.
#
# Usage:
#   surface-ready.sh --surface <surface_ref> [--pane <pane_ref>] [--timeout <s>]
#   surface-ready.sh --workspace <workspace_ref> [--timeout <seconds>]
#
# --pane is accepted for compatibility and used only in diagnostics; nothing
# focuses it.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   — ready (PTY attached and shell executing input)
#   2   — usage / dependency error
#   3   — timed out (target exists but never echoed the probe back)
