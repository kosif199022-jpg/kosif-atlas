# open-window-surface — land a new terminal surface in a SPECIFIC cmux window,
# find-or-create. Used by the hotline `--window <name|ref>` placement override
# to group callees by project.
#
# cmux windows are not directly name-addressable (`cmux new-window` takes no
# name and `cmux list-windows` reports name:null). So we identify a "named
# window" by a WORKSPACE titled <name> living inside it — workspaces ARE
# nameable (`cmux new-workspace --name`). This makes `--window <name>`
# idempotent: the first call creates a window + a workspace tab titled <name>;
# later calls find that workspace and reuse its window.
#
# Resolution:
#   • <name|ref> matching ^window:<n>$ or a bare integer → treated as a window
#     ref/index; the surface lands in that window's first workspace.
#   • otherwise <name> is matched against existing workspace titles across all
#     windows. Found → reuse that workspace. Not found → new-window +
#     new-workspace --name <name>, then land the surface there.
#
# This opener is hotline-net-new: cmux-cli's open-side-surface.sh only places a
# surface SIDE-BY-SIDE with the caller, never in an arbitrary find-or-create
# window, so there is nothing in cmux-cli to reuse for this. PTY readiness is
# delegated to the sibling surface-ready.sh so a just-created surface never
# drops the trailing \n of the launch command (fresh-PTY race) and never hits
# "Terminal surface not found" (PTY-not-attached).
#
# Everything here is created with --focus false. `cmux send` attaches the PTY on
# its own (verified on cmux 0.64.22: a --focus false workspace + surface answered
# a probe send and executed it in ~0.8s, with the user's focus untouched), so
# --focus true bought nothing here except moving the user's cursor into a callee's
# shell mid-keystroke (claude-plugins-r465.4).
#
# Usage:
#   open-window-surface.sh --window <name|ref> [--working-directory <cwd>]
#                          [--wait-ready] [--wait-ready-timeout <s>] [--json]
#
# Output (--json): same shape as open-side-surface.sh, plus "created" (bool)
#   reporting whether a new window was made. surface_id / pane_id / workspace_id
#   are the stable UUIDs, present when the tree lookup resolved them; every caller
#   should prefer them over the positional *_ref fields, which renumber.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = surface created (ready field reports PTY readiness when --wait-ready)
#   1 = cmux command failed (see stderr)
#   2 = usage / dependency / context error
