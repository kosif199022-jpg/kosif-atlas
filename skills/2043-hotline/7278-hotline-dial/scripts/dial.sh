# =============================================================================
# Dial: one invocation for the whole outbound-call flow.
#
# Composes the existing dial scripts — identity (session-init.sh),
# resolve-workspace.sh, check-cmux.sh, session-cache.sh, the cmux/headless
# launchers, wait-for-session.sh — into a single call that emits ONE JSON
# object. Nothing below modifies those scripts; this is orchestration only.
#
# NORMALLY ONE CALL. On current Claude Code (>= 2.1.132) session-init.sh reads
# the native $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID and identity resolves inline; Codex callers
# resolve via $CODEX_THREAD_ID the same way. The whole flow completes in a
# single invocation.
#
# RE-ENTRANT FOR LEGACY CALLERS. On a pre-2.1.132 Claude (or a stripped
# environment) identity falls back to fingerprint discovery, which needs two
# tool calls: the fingerprint only lands in the transcript after a tool call
# RETURNS, so no single invocation can plant it and then grep for it. Instead of
# making that the model's problem, this script persists the pending fingerprint
# keyed by the claude PID and asks to be run again, verbatim:
#
#   native/override/codex/cache hit → the whole flow runs in one call
#   legacy cache miss → plant, persist, emit {"status":"replay", ...}, exit 2
#   re-run            → discover from the pending fingerprint, continue as above
#
# Usage:
#   dial.sh --target <reference> --mode quick|work_order|conference
#           (--prompt-file <path> | --prompt <text>)
#           [--placement side|detached|window] [--window <name|ref>]
#           [--transport cmux|herdr|headless] [--remote <ssh-target>]
#           [--headless] [--tools <list>]
#           [--resume <session-id> [--no-fork]] [--fresh]
#   (a session id as <reference> continues that conversation; --no-fork applies)
#           [--caller-session <id>] [--refresh-identity]
#           [--boot-timeout <seconds>] --label <text>
#
# --transport picks the multiplexer that HOSTS the callee. cmux is the default and
# nothing about it changes; `herdr` is opt-in, and it hosts the callee HERE unless
# --remote names another box. Locally it takes side and detached placements and
# every mode, including conference (see the validation block below for what it
# still refuses, and why). A requested herdr that fails preflight is an ERROR,
# never a silent fall-back to cmux: a caller who asked for herdr asked for a
# callee that survives disconnects, and quietly giving them one that does not is
# worse than saying no.
#
# --remote <ssh-target> hosts the callee on ANOTHER BOX and reads its answer back
# over ssh. It SELECTS herdr on its own — no other backend can host anywhere but
# here — and defaults placement to detached, since nothing on another machine can
# appear in this window. The same refusal rule applies, harder: there is no local
# substitute for "run this over there", so a failed preflight is an error with the
# hop's own diagnostic and never a quiet local call.
#
# HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1 is the one way herdr is chosen WITHOUT --transport: it
# is an opt-in setting, and even then only inside a herdr pane and only when the
# preflight passes. See step 3.
#
# --prompt-file is preferred: it keeps the message out of argv, so quoting,
# newlines and shell metacharacters are never in play.
#
# --label <text> is REQUIRED — 2-4 words naming what the callee is DOING. It is the
# callee's session name, which claude emits as its terminal title, which cmux renders
# in the tab strip behind a live activity glyph: `◑ hotline: fix 500s (work_order)`.
# Nothing else distinguishes two callees dialled into one repo. A missing or
# empty/whitespace-only value is an args error.
#
# A SESSION ID IN --target CONTINUES THAT CONVERSATION. The id already names its
# workspace, so it is read as the conversation rather than as a directory handle:
# the callee resumes it, forked by default. To start a fresh callee in that repo
# instead, pass the WORKSPACE — there is no flag for it, because the workspace IS
# the way to say it.
#
# --resume <session-id> is the same request made explicitly, and is still how you
# continue a session that is not the target. It forks by default, so hotline
# protocol noise stays out of the original transcript; --no-fork contributes to it
# instead.
#
# --fresh ignores this caller's cached session AND cached surface for the resolved
# target, so the dial opens a BRAND-NEW callee session instead of resuming the one
# a previous dial left behind — the flag for a phase that must not inherit the
# previous phase's context (a "reviewer" that would otherwise be the implementer
# resumed). The cache is rewritten to the new session, and the surface this dial
# supersedes goes through the same proofs and guards a follow-up's would.
# It contradicts any request to continue a specific conversation, so it is refused
# alongside --resume AND alongside a session id in --target.
#
# Statuses / exit codes (stdout is ALWAYS a single JSON object):
#   connected            0   call is live; wait for the response separately
#   replay               2   legacy fallback only: re-run this exact command to finish identity
#   needs_disambiguation 3   ask the user to pick from .candidates, re-run
#   error                1   .stage / .detail / .recovery say what and why
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: wait-for-response.sh. It is long-running (a work order
# can outlast a tool-call timeout) and the model must report the connection to
# the user BETWEEN boot and response. Run it as its own step, unchanged.

# --- TTL sweep: reap abandoned call dirs before minting a new one. ----------
# This sweep is the ONLY cleanup a finished call gets; SKILL.md tells callers
# to leave their call dir alone. A caller-side `rm -rf "$CALL_DIR"` depends on
# a variable that does not survive across agent tool calls, so callers skip it
# (296 dirs, 218 with no `done` marker, were found abandoned on one machine,
# some for a week) or reach for `rm -rf /tmp/hotline-call-*`, which deletes
# other sessions' in-flight calls. The age floor below keeps this sweep from
# doing the same.
# Best-effort and scoped to our own name pattern only, like the launch-script
# sweep below: a dial must not fail because a sweep did (claude-plugins-qq9f).
# `HOTLINE_CALL_HOME` already isolates test suites from the real /tmp; this
# reuses it so the sweep never touches a directory the dial flow didn't itself
# create. `HOTLINE_CALL_SWEEP_DAYS` overrides the age floor (default 3) — short
# enough to bound the backlog above, long past the minutes a real exchange
# takes to finish or a failure takes to be read and re-dialed.
# `-mtime +N` DISCARDS THE FRACTIONAL DAY, so it means "at least N+1 full days
# old", not "older than N days": at the default, a dir 3 days 23 hours old is
# still spared and is reaped an hour later. That is the safe direction to be
# wrong in — it never reaps something younger than the floor — but it is why a
# backlog looks untouched for a day after this lands.
# THE TRAILING SLASH IS LOAD-BEARING on macOS, where /tmp is a symlink to
# /private/tmp: `find /tmp` without it reports the symlink itself, which
# `-type d` then rejects, so the sweep would silently match nothing.

# Precedence, first match wins:

#   2. --transport herdr     → herdr, or ERROR
#   3. HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1 + HERDR_ENV=1 + preflight passes
#                            → herdr, or DEGRADE to step 4 with a .fallbacks entry
#   4. otherwise             → cmux, with the existing cmux→headless degrade chain,
#                              unchanged — and that chain is where
#                              HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS acts, via check-cmux.sh.
#
# WHERE HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS SITS, precisely: it is read by check-cmux.sh, which
# only step 3 calls. So it forces headless for every dial that does NOT name a
# transport, and an explicit `--transport herdr` outranks it — a per-call flag beats
# an ambient default, and `.transport` reports what actually ran. That is deliberate:
# the alternative is a second copy of that variable's semantics here, which is how a
# constant with two definitions ends up disagreeing with itself. `--headless`
# together with `--transport herdr` is refused outright in the validation block
# above, because there both asks are explicit and neither is ours to discard.
#
# HERDR IS SELECTED BY AN OPT-IN, NEVER BY AN AMBIENT SIGNAL. Two things select it:
# `--transport herdr` per call, and HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1 — a setting somebody
# turned on deliberately, which is what makes it a decision rather than a surprise.
# Being inside a herdr pane (HERDR_ENV=1) or having a server up only makes herdr
# *available*: on its own that flips nothing, because every interactive local
# caller's reason for using hotline is a callee they can watch, and their
# environment must not quietly re-host it.
#
# So AUTO needs BOTH halves, and all four of these hold before it selects:
#   HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1  the opt-in, exactly '1' — nothing looser, so a stray
#                             `HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=0` in a profile cannot enable it
#   no --transport            an explicit flag is the caller's answer, not ours
#   not headless              --headless / HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS is also explicit
#   HERDR_ENV=1               the ambient half: the caller is IN a herdr pane, so
#                             the callee lands next to them rather than in a session
#                             nobody is looking at
# and then the preflight has to pass.
#
# A FAILED AUTO PREFLIGHT IS A DEGRADE, NOT AN ERROR — the opposite of the explicit
# branch below it, and for the reason that branch gives: nothing was ASKED for here.
# AUTO says "prefer herdr when it works", so when it does not, the honest answer is

REMOTE_PANE_OUT=""
# How much the delivery had to work to land. Present only where cmux-paste.sh actually
# reported them — the surface-reuse path — and OMITTED elsewhere, like every other
# optional field above: a headless call has no screen to confirm against, so a `false`
# there would be an assertion rather than a reading. `confirmed` names the tier that
# proved it (transcript is definitive, screen is inference); `retried_enter` says the
# submit needed a corrective Enter, which is the fkgv/y4rl race showing itself and is
# worth seeing before it becomes a bug report.
DELIVERY_CONFIRMED=""
DELIVERY_RETRIED=""
# How many turns the payload landed as, where that could be counted at all. One is
# a clean delivery; above one means the callee received the work order split across
# turns, which every other field here reports as clean — `confirmed` proves the
# nonce arrived, not how many turns it arrived in. Absent rather than 0 wherever the
# event stream could not answer (no cmux events, a herdr callee, an unread marker).
DELIVERY_FRAMES=""

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 5a — Follow-up into the surface the session already lives in.
#
# Preferred whenever it applies: the surface holds a live REPL for that exact
# session, so we send the next message into it instead of stacking a new surface
# per turn. Multi-line messages used to skip this outright, which meant the reuse
# path never ran for the follow-ups it existed to serve — work-order follow-ups
# are almost always multi-line, so every substantive one opened a second pane and
# orphaned the first. cmux-reuse-surface.sh now decides delivery itself: short
# single-line messages are typed in, anything larger goes to the call dir with a
# one-line pointer (claude-plugins-i8fb).
#
# EVERY bail records a fallback. The add_fallback for a refusal used to sit
# INSIDE this block, so a bail-before-attempt emitted `fallbacks:[]` — a
# follow-up that silently opened a second pane looked identical to a clean
# first-contact dial, which is how the surface sprawl went unnoticed for so
# long (claude-plugins-6nbr).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WOULD THE PREVIOUS EXCHANGE'S OWN WAITER DESTROY THIS ONE'S MESSAGE?
#
# For a DETACHED callee, yes, if that wait is still running. The tab auto-closes
# the instant the prior exchange's response is captured (wait-for-response.sh's
# cleanup_workspace_and_script, which the detached placement reaches with
# keep_workspace=false), and cmux-reuse-surface.sh's gates do not see that coming:
# a mid-turn REPL with an empty input box reads as reusable, so the paste is
# accepted and ENQUEUED behind the live turn. The callee then finishes the PRIOR
# turn, emits its STATUS, and the prior waiter closes the workspace — taking the
# queued message with it. The follow-up's own waiter then polls a dead surface to
# its full budget and reports a timeout for work that was never read
# (claude-plugins-zaus).
#
# So reuse waits for the prior exchange to be over. `done` in its call dir is the
# signal that exists, and every terminal path writes it — the captured response, an
# AWAITING_REVIEW checkpoint, a budget timeout, a preemption. Absent means the wait
# is live, OR that no waiter has run yet; both refuse, because the refusal costs one
# extra tab (the behaviour every detached follow-up had until this branch, and one
# that DID deliver the message) while a wrong reuse costs the message.
#
# Side and window placements are unaffected: they are the placements that set
# keep_workspace=true, so their waiters close nothing and a queued follow-up is
# delivered when the turn ends. A call dir with no keep_workspace.txt is read the
# way the waiter reads it — as false.

# Step 5a (herdr) — the same step, into a named agent instead of a surface.
#
# The named agent IS the session: `herdr agent prompt <name>` re-targets it, and a
# follow-up continues the same conversation in the same transcript. So this is the
# cmux step above with the surface machinery removed — no host to resolve, no input
# box to read, no interrupt to risk, and (step 7) nothing superseded to close,
# because the same agent is reused rather than replaced.
#
# The two things that DO carry over are the two that matter: a fresh nonce per turn
# (the transcript keeps every prior exchange's STATUS lines, so a reused nonce would
# read the previous turn's completion as this one's), and the rule that EVERY bail
# records a fallback — a follow-up that quietly started a second callee must never
# look identical to a clean first-contact dial (claude-plugins-6nbr).
#
# A REFUSED REUSE FALLS BACK TO A FRESH LAUNCH, and that costs the prior context:
# herdr cannot re-host an existing claude session (`claude --resume` and
# `--session-id` are mutually exclusive, and the launcher refuses the combination
# rather than derive a transcript path it would then read wrongly). The cmux
# fallback re-opens the SAME session in a new surface; this one cannot, so the
# fallback entry says so outright instead of leaving a caller to discover that its
# callee has amnesia.
#
# WITH ONE EXCEPTION: A BLOCKED AGENT IS NOT FALLEN BACK FROM, it fails the dial.
# The fallback is only honest when the thing being worked around is GONE. A blocked
# callee is live, and it holds the only copy of this conversation — so starting a
# fresh one and re-keying the cache to it leaves that agent running, waiting on a
# human, and no longer reachable through hotline. Meanwhile the response wait calls
# the identical state "a human must look" and stops (exit 5, resumable). Two
# verdicts for one state, and this end of the call picked the one that strands a
# callee (claude-plugins-7wze.13). So it is an ERROR here, with the same advice.

# Step 6b — Deliver the prompt into the freshly booted REPL.
#
# cmux-call-async.sh launches a BARE claude and leaves the prompt in
# pending_paste.md, so the payload never reaches an argv (claude-plugins-86ka) and
# first contact uses the SAME verified delivery verb as every follow-up. Boot came
# first because a paste into a shell that has not yet exec'd claude is lost with no
# error at all; --wait-box re-proves the input box is drawn immediately before the
# paste, which is a stronger claim than "the banner appeared once".
#
# AFTER the cache heal above, deliberately: which surface the session now lives in
# is true the moment that surface booted and resumed it, whether or not our
# message landed. Leaving the cache pointing at the surface `claude --resume` just
# took over is how a later follow-up types into a REPL nobody is reading
# (claude-plugins-2caw) — so the heal must not be skipped by a delivery failure.
#
# BEFORE step 7, equally deliberately: a delivery failure exits here, so nothing
# gets closed while something is wrong.
#
# A failed delivery is an ERROR, not a fallback: the surface is open and its REPL
# is live, but it was never told anything. Reporting "connected" would leave the
# caller waiting on a response to a message that does not exist.
