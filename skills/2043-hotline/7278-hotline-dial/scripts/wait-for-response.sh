# =============================================================================
# Wait for Response: poll until an async hotline call completes.
#
# Three modes. The launcher names its backend in call_dir/transport.txt ('cmux',
# 'herdr' or 'headless') and that is read first; an absent transport.txt names
# nothing, so the backend is inferred from the call dir's host handles. The cmux
# SUB-mode (surface vs workspace) is still the host-handle file distinction either
# way — see the dispatch block below, and wait-for-session.sh for the full contract.
#
#   Headless mode (transport.txt=headless, or no host handle at all): poll
#   call_dir/done at 2s intervals. headless-call-async.sh's own poller writes
#   response.json + done.
#
#   CMUX mode (placement.txt names a cmux placement): cmux-call-async.sh
#   doesn't run a background poller (under cmux access_mode=cmuxOnly, an orphaned
#   subshell gets "Broken pipe" on every cmux call). This script (a child of the
#   caller's cmux-spawned bash, so cmux access works) does the polling itself,
#   via two tiers:
#     PRIMARY — read the callee's Claude Code JSONL transcript (structured source
#       of truth; correlate on the CALL_ID nonce in event data, not scraped
#       pixels). transcript-extract.sh does the read; this is rendering-
#       independent and separates "never submitted" from "submitted, working".
#       Used whenever the transcript path is derivable (cwd.txt + session id).
#     FALLBACK — the legacy screen scrape (cmux read-screen + STATUS regex +
#       chrome stripping). Used for old call_dirs, a missing cwd/session, or if
#       the transcript file never appears. (claude-plugins-0pwc)
#   Either tier writes response.json + done and closes the workspace unless
#   keep_workspace.txt said otherwise.
#
#   herdr mode (transport.txt=herdr): the SAME transcript reader, gated differently.
#   herdr reports native lifecycle states, so `herdr agent wait` replaces the 2s
#   screen poll as the when-to-read gate, and transcript-extract.sh then decides
#   what the transcript MEANS exactly as above — same nonce/STATUS bracketing, same
#   0/3/4 contract, plus one outcome only a lifecycle can report: exit 5 when the
#   agent settles `blocked` with no STATUS for our nonce (it is waiting on a human,
#   not on time). There is NO screen-scrape tier: a claude REPL runs on the
#   terminal's alternate screen, whose rows never enter herdr's scrollback, so an
#   unconfirmable herdr call is reported as unconfirmable rather than scraped.
#   Nothing is closed afterwards — outliving disconnects is the point of herdr.
#
# Output (stdout, every mode):
#   {"session_id":"...","response":"..."}
# plus, on exit 4 only, an additive `"awaiting_review":true` — every other status
# emits byte-identical JSON to before.
#
# The emitted JSON is compact (single line) and re-validated via jq before
# being written to stdout — so stdout is guaranteed to be parseable JSON on
# exit 0, or the script exits non-zero with an error on stderr.
#
# Caller note: agents running under zsh MUST NOT pipe the captured output
# through `echo` (zsh's echo interprets backslash escapes and will corrupt
# any JSON with escape sequences). Use `<<<"$VAR"` or read from the
# call_dir/response.json file directly.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — response received, call finished (valid JSON on stdout)
#   1 — error (timeout, remote failure, unparseable response.json, or — in
#       transcript mode — no submit evidence for the nonce within
#       --submit-deadline while the payload sits in the callee's input box, either
#       as visible text or as a collapsed `[Pasted text` placeholder; message on
#       stderr)
#   3 — PREEMPTED: the callee was handed a different task mid-call AND no STATUS
#       for this nonce arrived within the grace window that followed, so it is
#       never coming. error.txt names the preempting prompt and the surface to look
#       at. The work may have completed anyway. A mid-call redirect of the SAME
#       order resolves normally instead of landing here — see the grace window
#       below. The surface/session is left LIVE (whatever keep_workspace.txt says),
#       exactly as on exit 4: this verdict is a judgement about a human's intent
#       read off a transcript, and closing the surface would destroy the only place
#       to check it — the very thing the message tells the caller to do.
#       (claude-plugins-dvjo, claude-plugins-mrpi)
#   4 — AWAITING_REVIEW: response received, but the work order is NOT finished —
#       the callee reported a checkpoint and is idle waiting for your review or
#       follow-up. Same valid JSON on stdout as exit 0, plus
#       `"awaiting_review": true`; the surface/session is deliberately left LIVE
#       (never closed, whatever keep_workspace.txt says) so you can reply into it
#       via cmux-reuse-surface.sh. Not a failure. (claude-plugins-n4vy)
#   5 — BLOCKED (herdr only): the callee's lifecycle settled to `blocked` and its
#       transcript still carries no terminal STATUS for this nonce. It is waiting on
#       INPUT — a permission gate, or a genuine question — which is neither "still
#       working" nor "timed out", and no amount of further waiting clears it.
#       error.txt says what to look at; the agent is left live. RESUMABLE: once a
#       human has unblocked it, re-running on the same call_dir opens a fresh budget
#       and reads the answer (see WAITER_TIMEOUT_MARKER).
#
# Why 5 exists: herdr reports this state natively, and before this the waiter could
# only spend its whole 30-minute budget on a callee that was never going to answer
# without a human — then report a timeout, which sends a reader looking for a slow
# work order instead of a dialog box. cmux infers the same condition from screen
# wording (repl_is_interrupted) and can only act on it at delivery time; herdr is
# told, so the wait can say it.
#
# Why 4 exists: "is the work finished" and "is the reply ready" are separate
# facts, and the protocol used to have one word for both. A callee doing step 1
# of 3 with a report-and-hold instruction could only honestly say
# WORK_IN_PROGRESS — which is exactly what this script treats as "keep polling".
# Observed live: the waiter blocked past its 600s tool timeout, was backgrounded,
# and had to be killed while the finished report sat complete in the callee's
# transcript. WORK_IN_PROGRESS still means keep polling, unchanged.
#
# Usage:
#   wait-for-response.sh <call_dir> [--timeout <seconds>] [--submit-deadline <seconds>]
#
# Re-invoking on the same call_dir is supported and always opens a FRESH --timeout
# budget. A previous waiter's timeout is a fact about how long that waiter was
# willing to wait, not about the call, so it is recorded as a resumable marker
# instead of a terminal verdict — see WAITER_TIMEOUT_MARKER below. A real remote
# failure (launcher error, preemption) still short-circuits instantly.
# (claude-plugins-tyaj)
#
# Environment:
#   HOTLINE_POLL_SLEEP — real seconds to sleep per poll tick (default 2, i.e.
#     $POLL_INTERVAL). The budget is accounted in fixed integer POLL_INTERVAL
#     ticks either way, so lowering this collapses wall-clock WITHOUT changing
#     how many iterations run or what they decide. Tests set it to ~0.
#     (claude-plugins-fhn3)
#   HOTLINE_CMUX_TURN_WAIT_SLICE — seconds one cmux turn-end gate may block for
#     (default 30). Once the transcript has confirmed our message submitted, there
#     is nothing left to look for but the turn ending, so the wait blocks on the
#     event instead of re-reading the transcript every 2s. It is a SLICE, not the
#     whole budget: a Stop that lands between the transcript read and the gate's
#     marker is missed, and the slice is the ceiling on what that costs. 0 disables
#     the gate and restores the plain poll.
#   HOTLINE_PREEMPT_GRACE — how long (default 180, in the same integer POLL_INTERVAL
#     tick accounting as --timeout) to keep polling after the callee's session shows
#     a preempting prompt, before giving up with exit 3. A human who interrupts to
#     REDIRECT the same work order looks identical to one who reassigns the session;
#     only the callee's next STATUS tells them apart, so the waiter waits for it.
#     Tests set it small. (claude-plugins-mrpi)

  # name. keep_workspace.txt is written 'true' by the launcher and this is where
  # that promise is kept — the agent and its pane are left live on every exit path.
  # (`herdr pane close $(cat $CALL_DIR/herdr_pane.txt)` is the manual teardown.)

  # A `blocked` callee is waiting on INPUT, and that is a DIFFERENT fact from every
  # other reason the transcript has no terminal STATUS yet. `working` means be
  # patient; a gone agent means it died; a timeout means the budget was too small.
  # `blocked` means a human has to look — a permission gate, or the callee asking a
  # question — and waiting longer cannot change it. So it gets its own exit (5) and
  # its own message instead of being spent as 30 minutes of budget and reported as a
  # timeout. It is NOT a new terminal STATUS: the protocol is untouched, this is the
  # LIFECYCLE saying why no STATUS is coming.
  #
  # Recorded through record_waiter_timeout on purpose. That marker means "a waiter
  # stopped, but the call did not fail" — which is exactly this: once the human
  # clears the gate, re-running on the same call_dir clears done+error.txt and reads
  # the answer with a fresh budget. Writing done+error.txt WITHOUT the marker (the
  # remote-failure shape) would make every later invocation replay this instead.
  #
  # blocked_confirmed is the gate on all of that: a settle is never acted on
  # unbacked. `blocked` can be a blink — a gate the callee's own hook answered a
  # moment later — so one confirming read separates a real dialog box from a
  # flicker, and it updates LAST_STATUS on the way past. Every caller goes through
  # this, so the rule has ONE implementation: the first version confirmed at the top
  # of the loop but not at the end of the budget, and the end-of-budget path then
  # ended calls on a state the confirming probe would have refuted.

  # Is the nonce sitting unsubmitted in the callee's input box? That is the only
  # thing that actually distinguishes "never submitted" from "submitted, queued
  # behind the callee's current turn" — the submit deadline cannot (mo8m).
  #
  # Measured: a user event lands 0.35-1.0s after Enter on an idle REPL, and
  # 3.1-4.2s when the REPL has anything in flight, because a follow-up sent
  # mid-turn is QUEUED and its event only lands when that turn ends. A callee
  # working a long task therefore has no upper bound worth hard-coding.
  #
  # We only ever ask this when the transcript shows NO submit evidence at all,
  # which is what makes the check sound: a submitted message renders into the
  # transcript, so if the nonce is on screen with nothing behind it, it is still
  # in the prompt box. Note a QUEUED message is also drawn on screen while it
  # waits — that used to read here as "unsubmitted", and the enqueue record now
  # rules it out before we ever look. (claude-plugins-1jpz)
  # A COLLAPSED PASTE HIDES THE NONCE. CC renders any paste over ~800 chars or 3
  # lines as `[Pasted text #N +M lines]`, so a parked work order — which is most of
  # them — puts nothing on screen that carries the call_id. Looking for the nonce
  # alone therefore answers "not visible" for the exact payload shape most likely to
  # be parked, and the waiter then sits out its full 1800s budget on a message that
  # was never going to submit. So the live input box HOLDING a placeholder counts as
  # the same evidence: the box is where an unsubmitted payload sits, and after the
  # submit deadline with nothing in the transcript, that placeholder is ours.
  #
  # BOX-SCOPED, BOTH SHAPES. `[Pasted text` in the scrollback is a submitted turn's
  # echo and would incriminate a healthy delivery — and the nonce is no different.
  # A whole-screen nonce match looks safe — a per-call nonce cannot be a leftover —
  # and is beside the point: a SUBMITTED payload echoes its own nonce back into the
  # transcript above the box, so finding it anywhere on screen proves arrival, never
  # non-submission. Read through a scrolled viewport that echo is often the ONLY
  # thing on screen, and a hard exit 1 then asserts the message is sitting
  # unsubmitted while the callee is mid-turn on it (claude-plugins-r465.6). The box
  # is where "arrived but never submitted" lives, and a short payload renders its
  # nonce there verbatim, so nothing legitimate is lost.
  #
  # The read is also scroll-immune (cmux_read_live) and tailed to the live screen
  # rows, so the box this looks at is the current one.
  #
  # This function looks and reports. It never presses Enter: an extra Enter on a
  # payload that did submit is a double submit, and the waiter cannot tell the two
  # apart (references/error-recovery.md § Delivery). Recovery is the caller's call.
  #
