# Wait for Session: Poll until the remote session ID is available.
#
# Three modes. The launcher names its backend in call_dir/transport.txt ('cmux',
# 'herdr' or 'headless') and that is read first; an absent transport.txt names
# nothing, so the backend is inferred from the call dir's host handles. Either way the cmux
# SUB-mode (surface vs workspace) is still the host-handle file distinction. See
# the dispatch block below for the full contract.
#
#   Headless mode (transport.txt=headless, or no host handle at all): poll
#   call_dir/session_id.txt at 1s intervals; cmux-call.sh and
#   headless-call-async.sh write it themselves.
#
#   herdr mode (transport.txt=herdr): the same file watch, because herdr's launcher
#   is SYNCHRONOUS — `herdr agent start` blocks until the agent is
#   interactive-ready, so herdr-call-async.sh has already written session_id.txt
#   and there is no boot to detect or preset to promote. This wait confirms the id,
#   surfaces the launcher's error.txt if it failed, and registers the call.
#
#   CMUX mode (workspace_ref.txt present): cmux-call-async.sh wrote
#   session_id_preset.txt but does NOT confirm claude actually booted —
#   under cmux access_mode=cmuxOnly, the script's own background poller
#   can't talk to cmux. This script (running as a child of the caller's
#   cmux-spawned bash) confirms REPL liveness via ANY of three signals:
#     A) `cmux read-screen` matches the Claude Code REPL banner.
#     B) The claude transcript file
#        ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<preset-session-id>.jsonl is non-empty
#        AND has grown since this script started (created, or appended to, the
#        moment claude opens the session). The growth requirement is not
#        pedantry: on a plain resume that file already exists, so a bare
#        existence check fired on the first poll and reported a boot that had not
#        happened yet.
#     C) The REPL has drawn its input box on screen.
#   Any signal promotes session_id_preset.txt → session_id.txt. Signal B
#   exists because banner regex is fragile (scrollback eviction, ANSI weirdness,
#   --resume banner variance can defeat it even when claude DID boot fine).
#
#   Signal C exists because first contact now launches a BARE REPL and delivers
#   its prompt by paste afterwards: a REPL with no prompt yet may write nothing
#   to its transcript until the first turn arrives, so signal B can stay silent
#   for a session that is perfectly up. The input box is the signal that actually
#   matters to the step that follows — a paste into a shell that has not exec'd
#   claude is lost silently — and it is strictly stronger than "the banner is
#   somewhere in scrollback", which stays true long after a REPL has died.
#
# Prints the session ID to stdout on success.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — session ID found (printed to stdout)
#   1 — error (timeout, missing call_dir, or early failure)
#
# Usage:
#   wait-for-session.sh <call_dir> [--timeout <seconds>]
#
# Environment:
#   HOTLINE_BOOT_POLL_SLEEP — real seconds to sleep per poll tick (default 1).
#     --timeout is accounted in integer ticks either way, so lowering this
#     collapses wall-clock without changing how many polls run or what they
#     decide — the same split as wait-for-response.sh's HOTLINE_POLL_SLEEP.
#     Tests set it to ~0. Ticks spent blocked on signal D's event wait are
#     unaffected.

# --- Backend dispatch --------------------------------------------------------
# transport.txt, written by the launcher when it creates the call dir, names the
# backend outright: 'cmux', 'herdr' or 'headless'. It is read FIRST and it is a
# COARSE selector — it says which backend owns this call dir, NOT which cmux sub-mode.
# The sub-mode is still the host-handle distinction it always was:
#   surface mode    — placement.txt says 'side' or 'window'. Poll the cmux
#                     SURFACE named in surface_ref.txt.
#   workspace mode  — placement.txt says 'detached'. Poll the cmux WORKSPACE named
#                     in workspace_ref.txt. A detached call records a surface
#                     handle as well, for a follow-up to re-address; that handle
#                     is NOT what decides the sub-mode (claude-plugins-zaus).
#
# An ABSENT transport.txt is a legacy call dir — one created before this signal
# existed, or staged by hand. Infer the backend from the placement exactly as
# before: a cmux placement (or, for a dir predating placement.txt, a host handle)
# means cmux; nothing means headless.
#
# A transport.txt naming a backend OUTSIDE the contract's set is refused outright
# rather than inferred — see scripts/transport.sh for why guessing is the worse
# failure. Inside the set, every value has its own branch below: transport.sh
# accepts a name and the dispatch here honours it, so the two never disagree
# about what 'herdr' means (claude-plugins-r6jj).
#
# WHY cmux STILL REQUIRES A PLACEMENT. The cmux branch below polls a surface or a
# workspace by ref, so a cmux call dir with no placement and no handle has nothing
# to poll — and that state is real, not hypothetical: transport.txt is written with
# the dir, well before a host is placed, and a launcher whose placement fails
# writes done+error.txt and hands that dir straight to this script. It takes the
# file-watch path below, whose check_early_fail reports the launcher's own
# error.txt. Forcing it down the cmux branch would replace that diagnosis with a
# bare `cat: no such file` from the ref read.
#
# cmux mode gets a longer default timeout (60s) because we're waiting for the
# receiver claude REPL to actually boot, not just a file to appear. Headless mode
# keeps its existing 30s default.

  # whose lifecycle wait-for-response.sh already owns — the `rm -f` it does on
  # STATUS reads the same launch_script.txt, so the moved copy is cleaned up by
  # the path that was always meant to clean this up. Before this, every dial left

  # `bash $LAUNCH_SCRIPT`, so anything earlier could move the file out from under
  # the retry. And ONLY on the success path: every failure exit above deliberately
  # leaves the file exactly where it is, because the timeout diagnostic tells the
  # user to re-send `bash <launch script>` by hand and a surface stuck on a
  # refused launch line is a forensics target. Those are what the age sweep in
  # cmux-call-async.sh reaps.
