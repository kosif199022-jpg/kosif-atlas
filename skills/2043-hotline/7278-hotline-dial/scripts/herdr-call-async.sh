# =============================================================================
# herdr Call: launch an interactive claude session as a named herdr agent and
# hand back the same call dir every other hotline launcher produces.
#
# THE LAUNCH IS SYNCHRONOUS, THE CONTRACT IS NOT. `herdr agent start` BLOCKS until
# herdr has detected the expected agent in the pane and considers it ready for
# interactive input — so unlike cmux-call-async.sh, this launcher already knows the
# callee's REPL is up by the time it returns, and it writes session_id.txt itself
# rather than leaving the promotion to wait-for-session.sh. The `-async` name is
# kept because the CONTRACT is the async one: return a call_dir, let the caller
# drive boot-wait / deliver / wait-response as separate steps. wait-for-session.sh
# still runs (it is what registers the call); for herdr it confirms and returns an
# answer that is already on disk.
#
# Call-dir interface — the same backend-agnostic contract as
# cmux-call-async.sh / headless-call-async.sh, plus one herdr-specific handle:
#   transport.txt         — 'herdr'. Read FIRST by the wait-for-* scripts.
#   herdr_agent.txt       — the agent NAME. This is the host handle: `agent prompt`,
#                           `agent wait` and `agent get` all address it, and it
#                           survives the detach/lid/SSH-drop events that kill a
#                           cmux surface. dial.sh reports it as the call's host ref.
#   herdr_pane.txt        — the pane the agent runs in. Diagnostic, and what the
#                           failure paths here close so a failed dial leaks nothing.
#   herdr_placement.txt   — 'split' | 'tab' | 'workspace': how that pane was made.
#   herdr_tab.txt         — the tab hosting the callee, for a tab/workspace
#                           placement; ABSENT for a split, which makes no tab.
#   herdr_workspace.txt   — the workspace hosting that tab. Both are here so a
#                           caller can re-label, move or close the host later.
#   remote_target.txt     — the ssh target hosting this callee, for a --remote dial;
#                           ABSENT for a local one. Written with the dir because
#                           wait-for-response.sh is a separate process that receives
#                           nothing but the call dir, and asking the LOCAL herdr
#                           about a remote agent gets "no such agent" — i.e. the
#                           callee reported dead while it works.
#   cwd.txt               — the callee's working directory; the transcript path is
#                           derived from it.
#   session_id_preset.txt — the UUID passed to `claude --session-id`.
#   session_id.txt        — written HERE (see above), not by the boot wait.
#   call_id.txt           — the per-call nonce, minted via repl-state.sh.
#   pending_paste.md      — the nonce-injected prompt, 0600, awaiting delivery by
#                           herdr-prompt.sh. Its presence is the signal to the
#                           caller that a delivery step is still owed.
#   keep_workspace.txt    — always 'true' for herdr; see WHY NOTHING IS CLOSED.
#   mode/caller_cwd/caller_session.txt — via persist-call-meta.sh, so
#                           register-call.sh can record the call.
#   error.txt + done       — written on any early failure, with the call_dir still
#                           returned, exactly as the other async launchers do.
#
# THE PROMPT IS NOT LAUNCHED WITH CLAUDE, for the same reason it isn't under cmux:
# a work order on claude's argv is readable by any local user through `ps`
# (claude-plugins-86ka). The REPL comes up empty and herdr-prompt.sh delivers.
#
# WHY NOTHING IS CLOSED AFTER THE CALL. A cmux detached workspace is closed once
# the response is captured, because a cmux surface is cheap and dies with its
# window anyway. A herdr agent is the opposite: surviving disconnects is the reason
# to choose this transport at all, and the follow-up path (herdr-reuse-agent.sh)
# re-targets this very agent by name. So keep_workspace.txt is 'true' and the agent is left live.
# The cost is honest and worth stating: a herdr call leaves a pane behind, and the
# caller (or the user) closes it — `herdr pane close <herdr_pane.txt>`, or
# `ssh <remote_target.txt> herdr pane close <herdr_pane.txt>` for a remote call.
# A tab or workspace placement leaves a tab too: `herdr tab close <herdr_tab.txt>`.
#
# A REMOTE CALLEE IS THE SAME LAUNCH, ON ANOTHER BOX. `$HOTLINE_HERDR_REMOTE` makes
# every herdr verb below run over ssh (herdr-state.sh's dispatch), so the placement
# and the `agent start` are unchanged. What DOES change is the cwd: it names a directory
# on THAT filesystem, so it is resolved and existence-checked over ssh rather than
# locally — see the canonicalization note below, which is where a local check would
# do real damage rather than merely be useless.
#
# Usage:
#   herdr-call-async.sh --cwd <path> (--prompt <text> | --prompt-file <path>)
#                       [--name <session-name>] [--label <text>] [--tools <list>]
#                       [--boot-timeout <seconds>] [--detached]
#   # → {"call_dir":"…","agent":"hotline-…","pane":"w6:p2","session_id":"…"}
#   #   plus "remote":"<ssh-target>" when $HOTLINE_HERDR_REMOTE hosted it
#
# --prompt-file is preferred: it keeps the payload out of argv end to end.
# --detached is accepted and ignored, and so is a side placement: dial.sh's
# placement vocabulary only changes what it reports. `--window` never reaches here;
# dial.sh refuses it. --label names what the callee is DOING and reaches the tab a
# tab/workspace placement creates; --name carries the same subject to `claude -n`,
# which claude publishes as the pane's terminal title — that is what names a SPLIT,
# which has no tab of its own. WHERE the callee's pane actually goes is
# $HOTLINE_HERDR_PLACEMENT — a sibling split (the default), its own tab, or a tab
# in a named group workspace ($HOTLINE_HERDR_WORKSPACE). See the placement block.

# check exists to catch into the same "" as a missing field. Ask whether the key is
