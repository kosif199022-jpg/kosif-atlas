# Hotline: Dial

Dial another workspace to ask questions, delegate work, or collaborate.

`dial.sh` does the plumbing — identity, resolution, transport choice, session
cache, launch, boot wait — in **one command** and hands back one JSON object.
Your job is the judgment: which workspace, which mode, and what to do about the
status it returns.

## Arguments

- **`$0`** (optional): Where to dial — a dirmap ID, path, fuzzy name, or a
  **session ID**, which dials that *conversation*: the callee resumes it, forked by
  default. To reach only the repo a session lives in, pass the workspace.
- **`$1+`** (optional): The task/question for the remote workspace.
- **`--resume <session-id>`**: continue a conversation that is not the target —
  a session in one repo while the callee is dialed into another. A session ID passed
  as the target already implies this, so you rarely need the flag. Forks by default,
  so hotline protocol noise stays out of the original transcript; `--no-fork`
  contributes to it instead. → `--resume <session-id>` `[--no-fork]`
- **`--headless`**: force the headless transport (`claude -p`) for this dial even when cmux is up. Debugging the headless path, A/B-ing transports, or wanting `claude -p`'s structured output. Costs programmatic-usage credit; the cmux default doesn't. → `--headless`
- **`--detached`** / **`--new-workspace`**: spawn the callee in a disconnected new workspace tab instead of a side-by-side surface. The tab auto-closes once the response is captured, so nothing is left to watch or clean up. → `--placement detached`
- **`--window <name|ref>`**: land the callee as a surface in a specific cmux window (find-or-create), for grouping workers by project. A `window:<n>` ref targets that window; a bare name reuses the window holding a workspace titled `<name>`. Wins over `--detached` if both are given. → `--window <name|ref>`
- **`--label <text>`** — **REQUIRED on every dial**, and normally yours to write rather than the user's: 2-4 words naming what this callee is *doing*, e.g. `fix-hotline-titles`, `review pr 2393`, `audit the cache gate`. It becomes the callee's session name, which is what you read in the cmux tab strip — `◑ hotline: fix-hotline-titles (work_order)`, glyph and all. Nothing else tells two callees in one repo apart. Missing, empty, or whitespace-only is an args error. On a **follow-up** it is ignored: the callee keeps the name first contact gave it. → `--label <text>`
- **`--herdr`**: host the callee as a **herdr agent** instead of a cmux surface — a persistent pane owned by the herdr server, so the callee **survives a detach, a closed lid, or a dropped SSH session**. That is the reason to ask for it: a long work order you do not want tied to the life of a window. Requires herdr running, here or — with `--remote` below — on another box. Takes any mode, including `conference`, and either the side or detached placement (herdr splits a pane off yours for both). → `--transport herdr`
- **`--remote <ssh-target>`**: run the callee **on another box** — herdr splits a pane and starts claude *there*, and hotline reads its answer back over ssh. For work that belongs on that machine: its checkout, its GPU, its network. It **selects herdr on its own** (nothing else can host anywhere but here) and is detached by nature, so `--remote <target>` alone is the whole invocation. Needs a non-interactive ssh hop plus herdr *and* claude on that box; if any of that is missing the dial is an **error**, never a quiet local call. → `--remote <ssh-target>`

## Native fast path — Claude Code only

Launching is the default. Claude Code can also hand a message straight to a session
that is *already running* (`ListAgents` + `SendMessage`) — that is the exception, and
it needs positive evidence in the user's own words. Take it **only when both hold**:

1. **The user names a running session, not a workspace.** "My other session", "the
   session/terminal/tab that's working on X", a name they were shown from `ListAgents`
   or set with `/rename`, or a reply to a `<cross-session-message>` you received. A
   workspace, project, or folder name is not a session reference: "dial/call
   <workspace>" always launches. `ListAgents` will usually show live sessions in that
   folder — hotline's own callees live there — so a live match on a project slug is
   expected noise, not a signal.
2. **The message is answerable from where that session already sits** — a fact, a
   nudge, a quick question about its own state. Anything it must go read or fetch (a
   URL, an issue, a file) or do is a work order: launch it, so it lands on a surface
   and the switchboard.

The user's words decide this, not a probe: do not run `ListAgents` to find out whether
native applies. In doubt, launch.

When both hold, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dial/references/native-messaging.md`
for the mechanics; it sends you back here if the live sessions don't match.

Codex: substitute the installed Hotline plugin directory for the leading path
segment above.

**Under Codex, skip it** — `ListAgents`/`SendMessage` are Claude Code only. The
flow below works from any harness.

## The one command

Write the message to a file and dial. One block, so nothing depends on shell
state carrying over:

```bash
# Codex: this path resolves under Claude Code; substitute the Hotline plugin directory.
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
PROMPT_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/hotline-prompt-XXXXX)
cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'HOTLINE_PROMPT_EOF'
<the task or question, verbatim — as many lines as you need>
HOTLINE_PROMPT_EOF
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/dial/scripts/dial.sh" \
  --target "<the user's exact words for the target>" \
  --mode work_order \
  --label "<2-4 word slug of the task>" \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE"
```

The quoted heredoc delimiter means the message is copied verbatim — no quoting,
escaping, or `jq` hazards, however long or gnarly it is.

Flags: `--mode quick|work_order|conference` (required),
`--label <text>` (required — 2-4 words naming what the callee is doing),
`--prompt-file <path>` (or `--prompt <text>` for a one-liner),
`--headless`, `--transport cmux|herdr|headless`, `--remote <ssh-target>`,
`--placement side|detached`,
`--window <name|ref>`, `--resume <session-id>` `[--no-fork]`,
`--refresh-identity`,
`--fresh` (ignore the cached session for this target and start a new one —
contradicts `--resume`), `--tools <list>`,
`--boot-timeout <seconds>`, `--caller-session <id>`.

Run `dial.sh --help` for the full contract.

## What it returns

Exactly one JSON object on stdout, always. Read `.status`:

| `.status` | exit | What it means | What you do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connected` | 0 | The callee is up. `.remote_session_id`, `.workspace`, `.transport`, `.call_dir`, `.surface_ref`, `.first_contact`, `.fallbacks` describe the call. On a follow-up into a live surface, `.confirmed`, `.retried_enter` and `.submit_frames` describe how the delivery landed. | Report the connection to the user, then wait for the response (below) — unless `.awaiting_response` is `false`. |
| `replay` | 2 | Identity needed a second pass. `.fingerprint` is now in the transcript. | Run **the identical command again**. Nothing else. Don't explain it to the user. |
| `needs_disambiguation` | 3 | The reference matched several workspaces; `.candidates` has them. | Ask the user which one, then re-run with `--target <their chosen path>`. |
| `error` | 1 | `.stage` (`args`/`identity`/`resolve`/`transport`/`fire`/`boot`/`deliver`), `.detail` (real stderr), `.recovery` (one-line hint). | Surface `.detail` and `.recovery` to the user, and leave the retry to them. |

`deliver` is the one stage that leaves something live behind: the callee's REPL is
up and this message was never proven to land in it, so there is an open pane — empty
on first contact, mid-conversation on a follow-up. Say so — re-dialling blind can
double-deliver, because the paste may have arrived just after the confirmation
window closed. The exception announces itself in `.recovery`: a trust-dialog refusal
is made before anything is pasted, so its recovery says nothing was delivered and
re-dialing is safe — the TRUST DIALOG entries in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dial/references/error-recovery.md`, under § CMUX
Failures for a cmux call and § herdr Failures for a herdr one.

Codex: substitute the installed Hotline plugin directory for the leading path
segment above.

`.confirmed` names the tier that proved a delivery: `transcript` read the nonce out
of the callee's JSONL and is definitive; `screen` inferred it from the rendered
viewport. `.retried_enter: true` means the paste's own submit key was dropped and one
corrective Enter submitted it — the delivery is good, but a run of them is worth
reporting.

`.submit_frames` counts the turns the payload landed as. **Above one means the callee
received the work order split across several turns** — still delivered, and
`.confirmed` says so, but the callee read it in pieces, which is worth reporting and
never a reason to re-dial (that would run the order twice). It is a floor rather than
a tally: a queued paste is counted when the queue flushes, so 1 is not itself proof of
a single clean turn. The field is absent, rather than 0, wherever the count could not
be taken: a cmux with no event stream, a herdr callee, or a first contact.

`transport` means the backend the caller asked for is not usable here — herdr is not
installed, or no herdr server answered. **It is never a degradation**: an explicit
`--transport herdr` is an ask for a callee that survives a disconnect, and quietly
handing back a cmux surface instead would be a lie the user only discovers hours later. Pass
`.detail` and `.recovery` through as-is; both name the fix.

## The herdr transport (opt-in, local or remote)

`--transport herdr` hosts the callee as a **named herdr agent** in a persistent
pane, split off the caller's own pane. What you get for it is durability: the herdr
server owns the PTY, so the callee outlives a detach, a closed lid and a dropped
SSH session — and it is still a pane next to yours, which is why side placement and
conference mode both work here.

| Combination | Answer |
|---|---|
| `--transport herdr`, any mode, `--placement side` or `--detached` | supported — first contact and follow-ups |
| `--placement window` / `--window <ref>` | refused — hotline creates no herdr workspaces or tabs, so there is no window to place a callee in. Not a phase gate; a feature nobody has built |
| `--resume <someone-else's-session-id>` | refused — herdr hosts a callee it *starts*, with a session id hotline presets so the transcript is readable; `claude --resume` cannot take that preset. Continuing a session **you** dialed needs no flag (see below) |
| `--remote <ssh-target>` | supported — see below. Implies `--transport herdr` and, unless a placement was typed, `--detached` |
| `--remote` with an explicit `--placement side` | refused — a pane on another box is beside nothing here. Side placement is accepted for a *local* herdr dial only |
| `--remote` with `--transport cmux`/`headless` | refused — remote hosting is herdr-only; a cmux surface lives in this machine's window server and `claude -p` is a local process |

**Follow-ups need no flag and no surface machinery.** Re-dial the same target with
`--transport herdr --detached` and the cached agent is re-targeted by name
(`herdr agent prompt`), so the conversation continues in the same session and the
same transcript. The named agent *is* the session, so there is no host to resolve,
no input box to clear, and nothing superseded to close.

**A cached agent that has exited** falls back to a fresh callee, reported in
`.fallbacks`, and that callee has **none of the prior conversation** — herdr cannot
re-host an existing claude session. The fallback entry says so outright; relay it if
the answer depends on prior context.

**A cached agent that is `blocked` on input fails the dial instead** (`stage:
transport`), and that difference is deliberate. A follow-up submitted into a
permission gate would answer the gate rather than start a turn — but that agent is
still live and still holds the only copy of the conversation, so answering with a
fresh callee would leave it running and unreachable through hotline. Nothing is
submitted and nothing is started: tell the user to clear it (`herdr agent attach
<name>` shows what it is asking), then re-dial exactly as before and the same agent
is re-targeted with its context intact.

**`--mode conference` hands the pane to the user.** The callee is started beside
the caller exactly as a work order is, the prompt is delivered the same way, and
then — only then, and only for a conference — hotline **focuses** the callee's pane
(`herdr agent focus <name>`). `.awaiting_response` comes back `false`: the session
is the user's to talk to, so there is nothing to poll. Report the pane and stop.
Every other herdr dial splits with `--no-focus` and never moves the user.

(`herdr session attach <name>` is a different thing and not the conference story:
it attaches a *detached* herdr session from another terminal.)

cmux stays the default, and an ambient signal never selects herdr: being inside a
herdr pane (`HERDR_ENV=1`) only makes the option *available*. Two things select it
— `--transport herdr` per call, and the opt-in `HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1` (see the
environment section), which lets `HERDR_ENV=1` decide for a dial that names no
transport.

`--headless` and `--transport herdr` together are refused — two explicit,
incompatible asks, and dropping either one silently would discard a flag the user
typed on purpose. An ambient `HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS=1` is different: a per-call
`--transport` outranks an environment default, and `.transport` reports what ran.

Two consequences worth telling the user about:

- **`.surface_ref` holds the herdr AGENT NAME** for a herdr call, not a cmux
  surface handle. It is the durable handle: `herdr agent get <name>` for its state,
  `herdr agent attach <name>` to watch it.
- **The pane is left open after the response.** Outliving the call is the point, so
  hotline does not close it the way it closes a detached cmux tab. When the user is
  done: `herdr pane close $(cat <call_dir>/herdr_pane.txt)` — or, for a remote call,
  `ssh <.remote_target> herdr pane close <.remote_pane>`, both of which the emitted
  JSON carries for exactly this reason.

### `--remote <ssh-target>` — the callee on another box

Same transport, one ssh hop. herdr's own `--remote` only attaches its TUI and
rejects every subcommand, so hotline drives the **ordinary herdr CLI on that box**
over ssh — `ssh <target> herdr pane split …`, `agent start`, `agent prompt`,
`agent wait` — against that box's own local server. Every verb, every refusal and
every proof tier is the local arm's; what changes is which machine answers.

What the dial needs, and what it says when it is missing (all `stage: transport`,
all errors rather than degradations — there is no local substitute for "run this
over there"):

| Missing | The error names |
|---|---|
| the ssh hop | that the target could not be reached **non-interactively**, and that hotline never answers a password or a browser check |
| herdr on that box | the target, not the caller's own install |
| a herdr server there | that nothing answered *there* — being inside a herdr pane yourself proves nothing about it |
| a pane to split there | `HOTLINE_HERDR_REMOTE_PANE`, the remote-only override |
| `claude` on that box's **non-login** PATH | `ssh <target> command -v claude`, because a claude under `~/.local/bin` may resolve for a human and not for an ssh command |

**The target is an absolute path on THAT box.** Fuzzy names, dirmap ids and
session-id lookups all resolve against this machine, so a remote dial takes the path
as it exists there and resolves it over the hop — which is also why a missing path
(`stage: resolve`) and an unreachable box (`stage: transport`) are reported
separately: they need opposite fixes. Two consequences to relay rather than debug:
`identity_stale` reads **true** for every remote target (the identity cache is
written by a pickup that ran *in* that directory, which never happened here — it
means unknown, not stale), and `--refresh-identity` is refused for a remote target
because it would run a local `claude` against a path that is not local.

Three more things worth telling the user:

- **The answer is read from the remote transcript.** `~/.claude/projects/<encoded
  realpath>/<session>.jsonl` on *that* box — both halves asked of it, never assumed
  from here — fetched over the same hop and parsed by the unchanged extractor. So
  `.response`, `AWAITING_REVIEW`, preemption and the exit codes are identical to a
  local call.
- **The work order never rides the ssh command line.** It is submitted through a
  fixed remote command that reads stdin, so it stays out of the local `ps` and its
  only argv exposure is the sub-second one on the box actually running it.
- **Tailscale SSH may want a browser check.** Its notice is filtered out of every
  read, but when the check period has lapsed a non-interactive hop cannot complete
  and the dial fails naming the `login.tailscale.com` URL. The fix is for the user
  to run `ssh <target> true` themselves once.

Follow-ups work exactly as the local ones do — re-dial the same target with the same
`--remote`, and the cached agent on that box is re-targeted by name. **Re-dialing
that workspace WITHOUT `--remote`, or with a different box, is REFUSED**
(`stage: transport`): the cache records which box a handle belongs to, an agent name
from another machine cannot be re-addressed from here, and starting a fresh callee
instead would leave that one running with nothing pointing at it — the cache write
replaces the entry that named it. The error names the cached agent, its box, and the
two moves: re-dial naming that box to **continue** the conversation, or add `--fresh`
to **abandon** it and start a new callee here. `--fresh` then reports what it left
running, and the command that closes it, as `abandoned-callee(…)`.

`.fallbacks` lists what the wrapper worked around on its way. All of them are
already handled; mention them only if the user is debugging or the degradation
matters to them (a detached tab instead of the side-by-side surface they
expected, say).

| Entry | What happened |
|---|---|
| `cmux-cli-missing→headless` | cmux is up but cmux-cli isn't installed, so the call was re-fired headless. |
| `cmux-unavailable→headless` | No cmux at all. |
| `terminal-paste-unavailable→headless(...)` | cmux is up and answered, but does not list `terminal.paste` in `result.methods` — the verb every cmux delivery uses. **Upgrade cmux.** |
| `python3-missing→headless` | No `python3` on PATH. The control-socket helper is python3-stdlib, so cmux delivery cannot run at all. **Install python3** (nothing to do with cmux). |
| `cmux-socket-unreachable→headless(<diag>)` | The control socket could not be reached — no socket file, connection refused, timeout, or a reply that wasn't JSON. The diagnostic is the real OS error. Usually cmux is not actually running, or `$CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` points somewhere stale; `~/.local/state/cmux/last-socket-path` names the live one. **Do not upgrade cmux for this.** |
| `cmux-rpc-error→headless(rc=N <diag>)` | The socket answered but refused the preflight (`rc=1` = `ok:false`, `rc=2` = a bad call from us). The diagnostic carries its error. This one is worth reporting — it usually means the helper and cmux disagree about the protocol. |
| `surface-context→detached` | Side-by-side needs the caller's own surface context and it wouldn't resolve, so the callee landed in its own workspace tab. |
| `surface-reuse→fresh(<reason>)` | A follow-up could not use the live surface, and nothing had been sent when that was decided (gone, mid-turn, post-interrupt, dirty input box, an RPC the socket rejected, or `detached-mid-turn` — a DETACHED callee whose previous exchange is still being waited on, whose auto-close would destroy a message queued behind it). It opened a fresh one instead; `<reason>` says which. A paste that went out and could not be confirmed is never this — it is a hard `stage: "deliver"` error, because re-delivering into a fresh `--resume` of the same session would run the work order twice. |
| `surface-reuse-skipped(no-cached-surface)` | A follow-up had no surface to reuse — first contact was headless, or a previous fold-in to headless cleared a stale ref. A `--detached` first contact records the surface inside its workspace tab, so it does NOT land here; once that tab auto-closes on completion, a later follow-up reports `surface-reuse→fresh(...)` instead. |
| `surface-cleanup→closed(<handle>)` | A follow-up opened a new surface, so the old one held a REPL nobody would speak to again. It was proven idle and proven to be the superseded exchange, then closed. |
| `surface-cleanup-skipped(<reason>)` | The old surface was left alone. Common reasons: it is mid-turn; `parked-input` (real unsent text in its box, which closing would discard — Claude Code's own placeholder does not count once it is proven to be one, though anything unproven still reads as text and spares the surface); its identity couldn't be proven from the prior nonce; `positional-ref-unsafe` (the cached handle is a `surface:N` ref, which can name a different surface than it did — closing requires a UUID); it was already gone; or cmux refused (it will not close the last surface in a workspace). `HOTLINE_CLOSE_SUPERSEDED=0` reports `disabled`. |
| `transport-auto→cmux(<reason>)` | `HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1` was set inside a herdr pane, but the herdr preflight failed — so the dial went to the cmux default instead. A degrade, not an error: nothing explicit was asked for. `<reason>` is the preflight's own (no server, no splittable pane, herdr not installed). |
| `herdr-conference-focus-failed(<agent>: <reason>)` | A herdr conference connected and the callee has the prompt, but `herdr agent focus` refused — so the user's focus did not move. Tell them which pane to go to (`herdr agent attach <agent>`). |
| `identity→refreshed` / `identity→refresh-failed(...)` | `--refresh-identity` ran (or tried to). |
| `session-cache→fresh(<session-id>)` | `--fresh` found a cached session for this target and deliberately did not resume it; `<session-id>` is the one abandoned. This entry is added before the new callee is launched, so it appears on a failed dial too — the repoint it implies only actually happens on a **successful** one (boot-confirm is what writes the new session into the cache). A dial that reports this entry AND an error left the cache pointing at the same abandoned id it always did; retrying still names that same id until a dial through this stage succeeds. On success: the call reports `first_contact: true`, and the cache now points at the new session. |
| `abandoned-callee(<handle> on <box>; …)` | `--fresh` overrode a box mismatch, so the callee named here is still RUNNING on `<box>` and no local cleanup will reach it. The entry carries the command that closes it (`ssh <box> herdr pane close <pane>`, or `herdr agent list` when no call dir still remembers the pane). Without `--fresh` this state is a `stage: transport` refusal instead. |
| `session-cache→fresh(transport <a>→<b>)` | The cached handle belongs to a different BACKEND on this machine (a cmux surface is not a herdr agent name), so it was not re-addressed and the new callee starts without the prior context. A different BOX is a refusal, not this. |

A follow-up that opens a second surface **always** records why. If you see a new
tab with `fallbacks:[]`, that is a bug — report it rather than explaining it
away.

`.awaiting_response` is `false` for a conference call **on first contact**, on either
transport — that session is handed to the user in a visible surface (cmux) or a
focused pane (herdr), so there is nothing to poll. Report it and stop.

## Your judgment calls

The wrapper deliberately makes none of these.

**Which mode.** Ask if it's genuinely unclear: "quick question, task to hand off,
or something to work on together?"

| Mode | When | Think... |
|---|---|---|
| `quick` | Need a fast answer | "What port does your dev server run on?" |
| `work_order` | Need autonomous work done | "Run the test suite and tell me what broke." |
| `conference` | Need back-and-forth | "Let's pair on this API integration." |

**Pass the user's *exact words* to `--target`, and let the wrapper resolve them.**
"Dial the writing workspace" goes in as `the writing workspace`, not as your guess
at which repo that is. The resolver plus dirmap exist to do that matching, and they
see dirmap entries and cached identities you don't; a guess substituted here
bypasses the whole chain and dials the wrong place.

**Then sanity-check what came back.** If `.workspace` doesn't obviously relate to
what the user said, confirm before relaying anything:

> You asked to dial "the writing workspace." That resolved to **dotfiles**
> (`/Users/you/.dotfiles`). Right workspace?

Skip the confirmation only when the match is plainly correct ("blog" → `my-blog`).

**A session ID dials the conversation.** Pass it through as the target and the
callee resumes that session, so a message about what it said, did or decided —
"what went wrong?", "summarize your last turn", "why did you take that approach?"
— reaches a callee that was actually in the room. When the user hands you a
session ID but the work needs only the *repo* ("run the suite there"), pass the
workspace instead; the session ID is not the way to ask for a blank slate.

**Then fork or assist.** Continuing a session **forks** it by default, so hotline
protocol noise doesn't land in their transcript. If the user's intent is clearly
to *help that session* ("continue that conversation", "help it fix its bug"), add
`--no-fork` to contribute to it directly. When in doubt, fork.

`--fresh` contradicts a session-ID target and is refused: one says continue that
conversation, the other says ignore what exists. Pass the workspace with `--fresh`
to start new there.

**Fresh phase, fresh session.** A re-dial to the same target silently resumes
the cached session. When the next dispatch must NOT inherit the previous one's
context — a reviewer for work this caller's last callee implemented, any
pipeline phase whose value is a skeptical fresh read — pass `--fresh`: it
ignores the cached session and surface and opens a brand-new session — and, if
that dial succeeds, repoints the cache at it (`.fallbacks` records
`session-cache→fresh(<abandoned id>)`; see the table above for what a *failed*
`--fresh` dial leaves the cache pointing at instead).
A plain re-dial is for continuing a conversation; `--fresh` is for starting
one in the same workspace with a new brain.

**Name the callee: `--label` is required.** 2-4 words for what the callee is
*doing*, not where it lives — `fix-hotline-titles`, `review pr 2393`, `audit the
cache gate`. The directory is the one thing every callee in a run already shares,
so it is the one thing that cannot tell them apart.

**You write the label**, from the work order you are about to send: the issue id
it names, or the verb phrase at the top of it. The user will rarely type one, and
there is no default to fall back on — an unlabelled dial is refused.

Where it shows up:

- **The cmux tab strip**, via the callee's session name. claude publishes its
  session name as the terminal title and cmux renders that live, so the tab reads
  `◑ hotline: review pr 2393 (work_order)` — activity glyph in front, changing as
  the callee works. Nothing here pins a static title, precisely so that glyph
  survives: a pinned title outranks claude's own for the life of the tab, and
  losing the glyph loses how you spot a callee that is stuck or waiting.
- **A detached callee's workspace name**, `hotline: <label>` — a detached
  placement has no tab inside the caller's window, so the workspace is what the
  strip shows.
- **The herdr sidebar's tab label**, for the `tab` and `workspace` placements: the
  call nonce's last 6 characters, then the label.
- **A herdr split pane's terminal title**, the same session name as above. A split
  has no tab of its own to label, but it does have a title.

Missing, empty, or whitespace-only is an **args error**, refused before anything
with a side effect — including on a follow-up, because whether a dial is first
contact is not known when its arguments are read. A **follow-up ignores** the
label, silently: the callee keeps the name first contact gave it, since a name
re-typed against "and now step 2" would be worse than the one chosen when the job
was described in full. Nothing lands in `.fallbacks` for it — a clean reuse worked
around nothing, and `first_contact: false` already says the value went unused.

**A stale-looking candidate list.** If `needs_disambiguation` candidates carry
empty or obviously outdated `identity` blobs, re-running with
`--refresh-identity` regenerates the resolved target's identity cache before the
call — always, not only past the cache TTL, because a within-TTL identity can
still be wrong. It costs a real headless `claude` call, tens of seconds and
programmatic credit, which is why it is opt-in rather than automatic. The payload
reports `identity_stale` either way.

## Then wait for the response

Report the connection first — the user should not wait on the callee to hear
that it's up:

> Connected to **[workspace name]** (session: `[session-id]`). Working on it —
> I'll relay the response when it's ready.

Then block on it. This is a separate step on purpose: a work order can outlast a
tool-call timeout, and you needed to speak to the user in between.

```bash
# Codex: this path resolves under Claude Code; substitute the Hotline plugin directory.
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
CALL_DIR="<.call_dir from the dial payload>"
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/dial/scripts/wait-for-response.sh" "$CALL_DIR" >/dev/null
RESPONSE=$(jq -r '.response' "$CALL_DIR/response.json")
printf '%s\n' "$RESPONSE"
```

**A wait that outruns your tool timeout gets backgrounded exactly once, by the
harness.** The default budget (1800s on cmux/herdr) outlasts any foreground Bash
call, so hand the blocking call to your harness's own backgrounding — Claude
Code's `run_in_background` — and add nothing on top of it. Wrapping it in
`nohup … &` as well leaves the harness tracking the wrapper shell, which exits
in milliseconds: you get a plausible immediate "exit 0" and then no notification
ever arrives when the waiter actually finishes. Where no backgrounding exists,
don't improvise one — let the foreground call time out and re-run the wait,
which resumes on a fresh budget and sends nothing (below).

Read the response **from `response.json`**, as above — not from the script's
captured stdout piped into `jq`. Under zsh (the Bash tool's shell) `echo` on
captured JSON mangles backslash escapes (`\n`, `\f`, `\u001b`, …) into raw
bytes that `jq` then rejects.

**A timeout is not the end of the call.** The `--timeout` budget bounds how long
*this invocation* waits, not the call, and re-running the script on the same
`CALL_DIR` resumes with a fresh budget — it re-reads the transcript (or the
screen) and sends nothing, so it can never double-queue work. Prefer that over
re-dialing when a work order is simply slower than the budget. A real remote
failure still short-circuits immediately instead of waiting again.

Exit codes that are not failures:

- **Exit 3 — the callee was reassigned.** (Not to be confused with `dial.sh`'s
  own exit 3, `needs_disambiguation` — different script, different meaning.) A
  cmux call sits in a visible surface, so the user can type into it. When they
  do, the script keeps polling for a grace window (180s, `HOTLINE_PREEMPT_GRACE`)
  and only exits 3 if no STATUS for your nonce arrives in it — a mid-call
  *redirect* of the same work order is tolerated and resolves normally. Exit 3
  therefore means they handed the session a different task, and `error.txt` names
  the preempting prompt. The surface and session are left live on purpose — the
  verdict is read off a transcript, so go check it. Report it plainly, and note the
  work you asked for may well have finished anyway: read the callee's transcript or
  look at the surface. **Do not silently re-dial.**
- **Exit 4 — reply ready, work order not finished.** The callee emitted
  `STATUS: AWAITING_REVIEW`: it reported a checkpoint and is idle waiting on you.
  Read `.response` exactly as on exit 0 (the JSON also carries
  `"awaiting_review": true`, the durable form of the signal). The surface and
  session are left live on purpose — relay the report, then send the follow-up by
  dialing the same target again. The wrapper routes it back into that same
  surface.
- **Exit 5 — the callee is waiting on a human** (herdr calls only). herdr reported
  its lifecycle as `blocked` with no STATUS for your nonce: it is sitting on a
  permission gate or asking a question, so more time cannot help. `error.txt` says
  what to look at; `herdr agent attach <name>` shows the actual prompt (prefixed with
  `ssh <target>` for a `--remote` call, which the message itself does). Tell the user
  what is needed, and once it is cleared re-run the wait on the same `CALL_DIR` — it
  resumes with a fresh budget and reads the answer. (Unattended callees avoid the
  *tool-permission* case by dialing with `HOTLINE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=1` — a
  real trust decision, and no help against the startup trust dialog, which no
  permissions knob bypasses. See § Environment knobs.)

Leave the call dir where it is when the exchange is done; cleanup is the
wrapper's job, not yours. Every dial starts by reaping call dirs older than
`HOTLINE_CALL_SWEEP_DAYS` (default 3 days), and that age floor is what makes the
reap safe: every session on the machine shares the `hotline-call-*` namespace,
so a younger dir may be another caller's call still waiting on its response.
Leaving the dir also keeps a `deliver` failure recoverable, because its pending
prompt is the surviving copy the recovery path reads.

Follow-ups need nothing special: dial the same target again with the next
message. The wrapper finds the cached session, re-addresses the host it lives in —
a cmux surface, or a herdr agent by name — and sends the message raw (never
re-wrapping the ringing command).

## Reporting to the user

First exchange — surface the connection details:

> Connected to **[workspace name]** (session: `[session-id]`).
> If you want to take over this conversation at any point, let me know and I'll
> give you the command to resume it in another terminal.
>
> **Their response:** [response text]

After that, just relay: > **[workspace name]:** [response text]

If the callee includes a `HOTLINE_NOTE:` in its response, always pass it on — it
means the protocol hit a snag.

## Takeover

If the user wants the conversation directly:

> Run this in another terminal:
> ```
> claude --resume [session-id]
> ```
> Let me know when you're done and I'll reconnect to get the final state.

When they return, dial the same target again with "Summarize what happened since
the caller took over."

## Environment knobs

Set these in `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `"env"` block or the shell:

- **`HOTLINE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=1`** — adds
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to the receiver's `claude`. **Off by default,
  and a real trust decision.** Without it, a call landing in an unattended pane
  stalls at the first permission gate with nobody there to click "Yes". If a call
  hangs at "Combobulating…" with no progress, suspect exactly that.
  It covers **in-session tool permission gates only.** No permissions setting
  bypasses Claude Code's *startup trust dialog* — not this knob, not
  `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` itself, not `bypassPermissions` as the
  settings default (`-p`/`--print` is the only escape, and a hotline callee is
  interactive), so an unattended dial into an untrusted repo parks on that dialog
  regardless. **Trust attaches to the git repository, not the directory**: a
  worktree or subdirectory of an already-trusted repo dials clean and never gets
  a trust record of its own, while a fresh `git init` is a new repo with its own
  boundary, and a directory that is not a git repo is not gated at all. So only a
  repo Claude Code has not trusted needs the one human action — run `claude` in it
  and answer "Yes, I trust this folder" — before dialing into it unattended.
- **`HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS=1`** — every dial takes the headless transport,
  regardless of cmux. Same destination as the per-call `--headless`.
- **`HOTLINE_CLAUDE_MODEL=opus`** — model override for the callee.
- **`HOTLINE_CLAUDE_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE=<path>`** — appends the file's
  contents to the callee's system prompt (`claude --append-system-prompt-file`),
  for steering the callee's behavior — e.g. an "Opus 5" operating prompt. Passed
  as a file, never inline, so the prompt never rides an argv where `ps` could
  read it; the file must stay readable until the callee boots. Applies at first
  contact only (a session's system prompt is set once, at birth); follow-ups
  reuse that session. A missing/unreadable path fails the dial up front.
- **`HOTLINE_CALLER_SESSION_ID=<id>`** — supply the caller identity directly.
  Skips the fingerprint dance entirely, so `replay` never happens. This is the
  escape hatch when identity discovery fails.
- **`HOTLINE_SURFACE_READY_TIMEOUT=<seconds>`** — PTY-readiness budget for a new
  surface (default 8).
- **`HOTLINE_CALL_SWEEP_DAYS=<n>`** — age floor (default 3) for the TTL sweep
  that runs at the start of every dial, reaping `hotline-call-*` dirs under
  `HOTLINE_CALL_HOME` (default `/tmp`) older than this. `find -mtime` drops the
  fractional day, so the effective floor is **n+1 full days**: at the default, a
  dir 3 days 23 hours old survives one more hour. It errs toward sparing, never
  toward reaping something too young. This sweep is the only cleanup
  a finished call gets.
- **`HOTLINE_PASTE_BOX_TIMEOUT=<seconds>`** — how long delivery waits for the
  callee's REPL to draw its input box before refusing to paste. Defaults to
  `--boot-timeout` (itself 60 for cmux), because both are waiting for the same
  thing; set this only to decouple them. It is not a politeness timer: a payload
  delivered to a surface that has not yet exec'd `claude` goes to the **shell**,
  which would run it, so a miss here is a refusal rather than a gamble.
- **`HOTLINE_PENDING_TTL=<seconds>`** — how long a `replay` fingerprint stays
  valid in `~/.agents-hotline/pending/` (default 600). A round-trip takes
  seconds; anything older is treated as a leftover and discarded.

One selects the transport, and it is the only variable that does:

- **`HOTLINE_TRANSPORT_AUTO=1`** — opt in to herdr being chosen without
  `--transport`. It selects herdr only when **all** of these hold: the value is
  exactly `1`; the dial named no `--transport`; it is not headless (`--headless` /
  `HOTLINE_FORCE_HEADLESS`); the caller is inside a herdr pane (`HERDR_ENV=1`); and
  the herdr preflight passes. A failed preflight is a **degrade** to the cmux
  default with a `transport-auto→cmux(...)` entry in `.fallbacks`, not an error —
  nothing explicit was asked for. `.transport` always reports what actually ran.

The rest are herdr-only and select nothing — `--transport herdr` or the opt-in
above still does that:

- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_PANE=<pane-id>`** — the pane hotline splits to host the callee.
  Defaults to the caller's own `$HERDR_PANE_ID`, then to the first pane herdr
  reports. Name one when the automatic choice lands somewhere awkward.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_PLACEMENT=split|tab|workspace`** — where the callee's pane goes
  (default `split`, a sibling of the anchor pane). `tab` gives the callee its own
  tab in the workspace that owns the anchor; `workspace` gives it its own tab inside
  the group workspace named by `HOTLINE_HERDR_WORKSPACE`. Name one of the latter two
  when a run dials several callees off one pane: as splits they land in a single tab,
  and past a handful of slivers the leftmost panes cannot be reached.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_WORKSPACE=<label>`** — the group workspace `placement=workspace`
  hosts the callee in, looked up by label and created if no workspace answers to it.
  Required for that placement, ignored by the other two. One label per group, chosen
  by the caller, is how a run's callees end up together.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_TAB_LABEL=<text>`** — the callee's tab label VERBATIM, for a
  `tab` or `workspace` placement. The escape hatch for a shape `--label` does not
  offer; `--label` is the flag to reach for, and it produces the standard shape — the
  call nonce's last 6 characters, then the label. herdr's sidebar truncates the tail
  and a run's callees usually share one repo, so the unique token leads. The budget
  and its split live in `herdr_tab_label` (`scripts/herdr-state.sh`).
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_SPLIT_DIRECTION=right|down`** — which way a `split` placement
  goes (default `right`).
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_PANE_SETTLE=<seconds>`** — pause before the first readiness probe
  of a freshly split pane (default 1), and the starting value the retry backoff
  doubles from. `agent start` requires the pane to be at its shell prompt.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_START_BUDGET=<seconds>`** — the whole wall clock the launcher may
  spend getting the pane to its prompt and retrying a busy start (default 30). The
  wait itself is a poll on `pane process-info` — the pane is available exactly when
  its foreground process group is the shell — so a slow shell costs poll time, not
  start attempts. Exhausting the budget lets the next start go ahead so herdr's own
  refusal is what gets reported.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_READY_POLL=<seconds>`** — how often that poll re-reads the pane
  (default 0.5).
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_START_ATTEMPTS=<n>`** — how many `agent start` invocations to make
  after herdr reports the pane ready (default 4). Readiness is read one instant and
  acted on the next, so this covers only that race; the wait for a booting shell is
  `HOTLINE_HERDR_START_BUDGET`'s job, not this one's.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_FIRST_SETTLE=<seconds>`** — pause between `agent start`'s
  readiness claim and the FIRST delivery into that agent (default 1). `agent start`
  reports the REPL interactive-ready once, at return, and under load that claim can
  lead actual keystroke acceptance; this is the wall clock a re-probe cannot buy.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_READY_TRIES=<n>`** — how many times first-contact delivery
  re-reads `agent get` waiting for `interactive_ready` and a non-`blocked` state
  (default 20, at `HOTLINE_PASTE_CONFIRM_SLEEP`'s cadence). Exhausting it refuses the
  delivery with `sent:false`, so nothing was submitted and a re-dial is safe.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_FIRST_CONFIRM_TRIES=<n>`** — the transcript-confirmation budget
  for a FIRST delivery (default 40, four times the follow-up budget). First contact
  waits on the callee's transcript being *created*, not appended, so the follow-up
  budget reported landed payloads as unconfirmed under load.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_BLOCKED_SETTLE=<seconds>`** — pause between the two reads that
  confirm a follow-up's cached agent is really `blocked` (default 1). That state
  fails the dial, so a blink must not be acted on.
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_WAIT_SLICE_MS=<ms>`** — how long one `herdr agent wait` blocks
  before the response wait re-reads the transcript (default 30000).
- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_KEEP_FAILED_PANE=1`** — keep the pane after a failed launch. Off
  by default (a failed dial should leak nothing); on, the pane's scrollback is the
  only evidence of a launch that died before the agent was detected.

These four apply to a **`--remote`** dial only:

- **`HOTLINE_HERDR_REMOTE_PANE=<pane-id>`** — the pane on the REMOTE box that
  hotline splits, defaulting to the first pane that box's herdr reports. Named
  separately from `HOTLINE_HERDR_PANE` on purpose: a pane id means nothing on
  another machine, so a habitual local override must never be applied to one.
  `$HERDR_PANE_ID` (the caller's own pane) is ignored for a remote dial.
- **`HOTLINE_REMOTE_SSH_TIMEOUT=<seconds>`** — the floor on each ssh hop's budget
  (default 60). A hop carrying a blocking herdr verb gets the herdr `--timeout` plus
  30s instead, so `agent start` is not killed out from under a working launch.
  Every hop is time-boxed: a Tailscale check period that has lapsed would otherwise
  block a `BatchMode` hop indefinitely.
- **`HOTLINE_REMOTE_SSH_PERSIST=<seconds>`** — how long the shared ssh connection
  outlives the last hop (default 300). One `ControlMaster` connection is shared by
  every process of one dial, so the tailnet check and any key handshake happen once;
  this has to outlast the gap between the dial returning and the response wait
  starting.
- **`HOTLINE_REMOTE_SSH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=<seconds>`** — ssh's own connect budget
  (default 10).

If the `/cmux-cli:using-cmux-cli` skill is available and a cmux-routed call
misbehaves, invoke it — it documents the workspace/surface/tty semantics this
transport depends on, which beats guessing at connection failures.

For what the dial flow itself speaks over cmux's control socket — the three RPC
methods, the snake_case-and-verify-the-echo addressing rule, `terminal.replay`'s
`anchor`, and the fact that `terminal.viewport` is a setter that would reflow the
callee's REPL — read
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dial/references/cmux-rpc.md`.

## Transparency: always surface problems

**Every problem reaches the user, in the same turn you hit it.** A nonzero
`.status`, an unexpected response, a permission issue, a resolution that doesn't
match what the user said — report each one with the specific error and the stage
it failed at, then say what you did about it.

**Bad:** "CMUX failed, falling back to headless."
**Good:** "The side-by-side surface couldn't be opened — `.detail` says
`[exact error]`. The wrapper re-routed through headless, so the call went
through, but it's in no visible pane."

The user is your partner in debugging this system. Hidden errors waste their time
and make the plugin harder to improve.

## Error recovery

**Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dial/references/error-recovery.md`** when
`.status` is `error` and `.recovery` isn't enough — it covers the specific failure
modes per stage, and the cmux transport forensics behind a follow-up that appears
to vanish.
