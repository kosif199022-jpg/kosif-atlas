# Orchestrator

The main thread owns orchestration — and most of the time, orchestration means
doing the work. A subagent is a tool with a price: a spawn, a prompt you have to
write, a round trip, and a summary you then have to trust. Delegation is worth it
when that price buys something (isolation of a large read, real parallelism); it
is a loss when it does not.

The failure this skill exists to prevent is not under-delegation. It is a simple
task fanned out to five agents, each waiting on the last, taking ten minutes to
do three minutes of work.

Subagents do bounded work and return concise results; they do not recursively
delegate unless the task explicitly requires a nested workflow. Use [the host
mapping](../../workflows/host-mapping.md) for the active delegation, user-input,
and thread-control interfaces.

**Trigger phrases:** orchestrate this, delegate this, break this down, coordinate subagents, fan this out, this is a big/multi-step task.

## Does this need delegating at all?

Ask before decomposing anything. Delegation pays only when **at least one** of
these is true:

1. **The output is large and you need only the conclusion.** Reading thirty files
   to answer one question — the bytes stay in the subagent, the answer comes back.
2. **Two or more units are genuinely independent** and can run at the same time.
   Genuinely: neither needs the other's result.

…**and** the work is bigger than a handful of tool calls. Below that, the round
trip costs more than doing it.

If neither holds, do it inline. That is not a failure of orchestration; it is
orchestration. Worked examples, including the cases where delegation loses:
[delegation cost](references/delegation-cost.md).

Two shapes that look like orchestration and are not:

- **A dependent chain.** A → wait → B → wait → C, where each needs the last, is
  strictly slower than doing A, B, C inline: you pay every round trip and gain no
  parallelism. Chain inline; delegate the branches.
- **Splitting to look thorough.** Three agents on one small file is not coverage,
  it is three summaries of the same thing.

## The core loop

1. **Do the cheap discovery yourself.** List the files, find the entry point, read
   the file you already know. Never delegate a single-fact lookup.
2. **Decide whether delegation pays** by the test above. Often it does not — go
   do the work.
3. **If it pays, decompose into independent units.** Independent units run in
   parallel; dependent ones you do inline.
4. **Delegate with a contract.** One answerable question per agent, a tight
   prompt, and an explicit return shape ("a file:line table", "the verdict + why",
   "a 5-line summary").
5. **Synthesize.** The main thread holds the conclusions and makes the decisions.

## Delegate vs do inline

Inline is the default, so the right-hand column is where most work belongs.

| Do inline (main thread) | Delegate to a subagent |
|---|---|
| A read of a file you already know | Broad/fan-out search across many files or naming conventions |
| A single-fact grep where you know the symbol | Reading many files to answer one question |
| An edit you can make in a few tool calls, however many files | Independent work that can genuinely run in parallel |
| A dependent chain of steps — each needs the last | Review / audit of a whole diff or subsystem |
| The final synthesis and every decision | Anything returning a lot of bytes you need only the conclusion of |
| Anything where the round trip costs more than the work | A long-running sweep you want isolated from main context |

Rule of thumb: if the answer means reading across several files and you only need the conclusion, **delegate it and keep the conclusion, not the file dumps.** Once delegated, don't also run it yourself in parallel — that pays for the work twice.

## When an agent goes quiet

Waiting is not a strategy. Every delegation is bounded before it starts, and
unbounded waiting is a bug:

- **Scope it to one answerable question.** "Find every call site of X" comes back.
  "Improve the module" does not.
- **State the return contract in the prompt.** An agent that knows it owes a
  file:line table finishes; one asked to "look into it" wanders.
- **If it does not come back, check once. Then take the work back inline and say
  so.** Report what you did instead — a silent takeover looks like the agent
  succeeded.
- **Never block indefinitely.** A subagent that has gone quiet has already cost
  more than the work; sitting on it converts a slow task into a stuck one.

An agent that returns something unusable is the same case: use it or redo the
work inline, but do not re-spawn the same prompt hoping for a better roll.

## Which agent for which job

Prefer a **tier-pinned** agent when one fits — its frontmatter fixes the model, so routing can't be forgotten:

- **`toolu:quick-task` / Codex `quick-task`** — mechanical lookups and listings.
- **`toolu:deep-explore` / Codex `deep-explore`** — structural exploration.
- **`toolu:research-agent` / Codex `research-agent`** — external research.
- **`toolu:implementer` / Codex `implementer`** — one bounded plan step and tests.
- **`toolu:architect` / Codex `architect`** — design and synthesis, read-only.
- **`Explore`** — broad read-only fan-out search when you need the conclusion, not file dumps.
- **`Plan`** — design an implementation strategy for a non-trivial change.
- **`general-purpose`** — multi-step research/execution that doesn't fit a specific agent; set `model:` yourself.

Carry the session mandates into every subagent prompt (comemory recall/save, ast-grep first). Delegation never exempts the work.

## Parallelize independent work

Launch independent subagents in **one message with multiple tool calls** so they run concurrently — not one-at-a-time. Dependent steps wait; independent steps don't. A four-way independent search done serially wastes three-quarters of the wall-clock.

## Keep main context lean

The expensive, recurring cost in a long session is **input tokens re-sent every turn**. Two rules follow:

- **Return conclusions, not bytes.** A subagent may read 50k tokens but should return a 1–2k-token distilled answer. The detailed context stays isolated in the subagent and never re-enters — or re-caches into — the main thread.
- **Prefer compact return formats** (tables, file:line lists) over prose dumps.

## Model tiers

Route on the **class of work**, not phrasing. Select the matching preconfigured
agent or pass the active host's explicit model and reasoning settings. Omitting
routing inherits host defaults, which may be inappropriate for the task.

| Class | Claude default | Codex default | Belongs here |
|---|---|---|---|
| mechanical | `haiku` | Luna / medium | lookups, listings, formatting, one command |
| exploration | `sonnet` | Terra / medium | read-only search across many files |
| implementation | `sonnet` | Terra / medium | a bounded decided edit + tests |
| review | `sonnet` | Terra / high | diff review, audits |
| synthesis | `opus` | Sol / high | reconciling findings |
| architecture | `opus` | Sol / high | design and hard-to-reverse calls |

Escalate one tier on any of: **hard to reverse**, **cross-cutting**, **the how isn't decided**, **must weigh alternatives**. De-escalate when the task is bounded and has one verifiable answer. Deciding and doing are different classes — one task often splits across two tiers.

A subagent that returns `ESCALATE: <reason>` should be re-run one tier up with that reason in the prompt; never re-run the same tier hoping for a better roll.

Full rubric (signals, worked examples, per-step plan tiers, config remap): `plugins/toolu/skills/orchestrator/references/model-routing.md`. Remap any class in `toolu.config.json` under `models`.

## Fan-out budget guardrail

Subagents multiply token spend (multi-agent runs can cost ~15× a single thread; unmanaged fan-out has produced four- and five-figure single-session bills). Before a large fan-out: cap the number of parallel agents to what the task needs, give each a tight scope, and prefer one well-scoped sweep over a runaway loop. If you bound coverage (top-N, sampling), say so — don't let "covered everything" hide a silent cap.
