# Merismos Protocol

Apportion an autonomous goal into coarse execution units and derive each unit's completion conditions before the run begins: cut the goal at its evidenced seams so each unit fits one execution horizon and no obligation is orphaned, derive per-unit completion and invariant predicates plus the cross-unit plan conditions, and emit one goal entry per unit. Type: `(GoalPlanUncompiled, User, APPORTION, AutonomousGoal × ExecutionHorizon) → ConditionBearingUnitPlan`.

## Definition

**Merismos** (μερισμός: a dividing into parts, an apportionment): A dialogical act of apportioning one stated autonomous goal — deciding **which units the goal is carried out in** and **what each unit's done means** — when the goal is stated but its plan is uncompiled. The protocol's lexical verb is `/apportion`. It reads the goal's obligations — the host's own standing procedural contract subtracted, since that attaches to every change the host accepts whatever the goal is — cuts them into coarse units at seams it can cite, judges each unit against one execution horizon, derives a completion predicate and any invariant predicates per unit, separates the conditions whose subject is the whole goal rather than any one unit, and shows the whole plan on one sheet every turn, beside what the person's last turn changed. An item no check could settle because what settles it is a judgment made against the context accumulated by then and what the person has actually said by then is reserved rather than compiled — recorded with the ground that settles it, at the unit level and for the whole-goal acceptance criterion alike, and kept apart from the waiver that records an acceptance criterion the plan simply lacks. Each unit's certificate carries every compiled check, every accepted gap, and every reservation of its done together, so no one of them hides another. Activation takes one goal: a request bundling several stated outcomes whose only common bond is that standing contract relays at the checkpoint instead, one apportionment per goal. The person takes the plan, stops, or goes elsewhere; your contrary grounds stand before them and ride the plan when they take it over them. Merismos apportions and conditions; it does **not** order — sequence, independence, reconciliation, termination topology and routing are outside its own scope, so the emitted plan is a **pre-conduct** artifact. The protocol holds no state during execution.

How to read this block. It is core Lean 4 and elaborates as written, and you are the model it is
written for: you read it, and by inference over the context you settle each element it leaves
open. Every `axiom` is one of those judgments — a black box to the contract, yours to make from
the material in front of you; its doc comment says what you judge there, and nothing in this
block decides it for you. Every `def`, `inductive`, and `structure` is fixed by the contract.

Every sheet re-judges the whole plan against the whole context: nothing counts down, no stage is

one unit, a region, a condition, the acceptance question — and the draft re-fills what depends on
it, the ledger saying which re-fills are forced and which you propose. A cut sent back, a unit
reopened, a condition adjusted are all edits of the same kind. The loop is dialogue: each sheet
ends at the focus, and the person ends the run. The run holds no state into the execution interval.

nothing about whether a check is the right one, and a contrary ground it was taken over rides the

reservation with its ground — and the capability requirements and feasibility notes; (c) the plan
conditions with the requirement that makes each safe to discharge; (d) every out-of-scope
obligation with its substrate, and what was subtracted as the host's standing contract; (e) the
acceptance question as settled — the criterion and whose it was, the reservation stated as left
open on purpose, or the waiver — never two of these; (f) how each value came to stand — who
proposed it, set or adopted — and the turns read as setting values, quoted; (g) the dissent the

end Merismos
```

## Core Principle

Merismos compiles one autonomous goal into coarse, horizon-fit units and the conditions by which each unit is done. It apportions and conditions; order, independence, reconciliation, termination topology, routing, and execution belong downstream. The whole plan is shown on one sheet every turn, so coverage, fit, seam quality, and conditions stay inspectable together, and nothing is taken before it has been seen whole.

## Substrate Boundary

Merismos stops after emitting and parking the condition-bearing plan. Units carry functional capability requirements and feasibility notes; predicate enforcement, pre-action interception, workflow control, and concrete executor binding belong to the consuming substrate.

## Mode Activation

### Activation

`/apportion` is user-initiated. Activate only for one stated autonomous goal with no condition-bearing unit plan. A host requirement that applies to every accepted change is inherited by every unit and is excluded from the goal's obligation set unless the goal itself states it as an outcome.

Read prior protocol output first, then explicit arguments, then conversation context. A boundary map or an unresolved autonomous region may ground a fresh apportionment; an existing `/apportion` result is condition-bearing when its carrier gives every unit a certificate that says when it is done.

### Activation exceptions

Relay and deactivate when there is no autonomous interval, the request bundles several outcomes held together only by the host's standing procedure, the goal is already condition-bearing, or its scope yields no obligation. A present navigation block that cannot be dereferenced, lacks its session half, or leaves a premise required for current compilation unsupported is an unreadable handoff and never falls through to fresh compilation. Unsupported downstream judgments remain open under the incoming grounding instruction while independent compilation can continue.

## Protocol

### The sheet

Every turn shows the whole plan on one sheet, in everyday language, opening with the goal in one plain sentence and carrying what `respond` names: each unit with its obligations stated by what they require, its fit and why, its seam with its citation or its declaration that the goal evidences none, what carrying it out needs, and its certificate; then the whole-goal conditions, the acceptance question, the out-of-scope obligations with who must catch them, and what was subtracted as the host's own standing procedure. Every line is drawn on every sheet, unchanged ones included. The sheet separates its fields with the structure the host renders — headings, tables, lists — so each field reads on its own under a label that is the question it answers, worded in the person's everyday language, and each value shows whether it is the person's or the draft's. A decision, an issue, or an earlier option is named by what it holds; an identifier only the session can decode stands at most beside those words. A host that can fold the sheet may; the contract shows it whole.

Under the sheet, the ledger of what the last turn changed: the person's edits first, then each value the draft re-filled because of them, pointing to the edit that caused it and marked as forced by that edit or as your proposal. A removed unit and a replaced value stay in the ledger with what they were. Then your contrary grounds, each beside the value it bears on.

Then one focus, with concrete actions and what each would do. Mark one action as recommended only where the ground clearly separates it from the others; where the actions are comparable, leave them side by side with their consequences.

The person may answer in their own words, and one answer may edit several units. An answer to the focus settles that point only; a taking is said of the plan and takes everything the sheet shows, adopting what the draft proposed and accepting the gaps shown. A unit that does not fit is taken only by words that take it over its fit; for a fit that could not be judged, those words name the uncertainty. With nothing open, the focus asks whether to take the plan and says what a taking would not yet satisfy. Wherever you read one of the person's earlier turns as setting a value, say which turn and what you took from it, quoting their words.

A completion condition is an executable stop-time predicate; an invariant condition is a boundary the interval preserves while completing. An obligation that could become a predicate after sharpening is a gap left unguarded. An item only live judgment can settle is held open with the ground that will settle it. An obligation requiring interception before action is out of scope and names what must intercept it.

On a taking, emit one entry per unit with its whole certificate — every check, every accepted gap, every held-open item — and keep a reserved acceptance criterion visibly apart from a waived one. Park the packaged plan in one durable carrier and emit a navigation block that points to it; a receiving session dereferences that carrier, runs `/inquire` where available or an equivalent grounding pass, and reads the governing utterances to recover each reservation's retained or entrusted judgment. Where the carrier write comes back incomplete, nothing closes: the sheet shows what is missing.

Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when terminology must remain stable, wording must travel unchanged, material belongs to another round or trace, or phase order determines placement.

## Composition

A non-trivial multi-unit plan may pass to `/conduct` as a navigation block over its parked carrier; an unresolved autonomous region from `/conduct` may pass here for apportionment. Both directions are advisory and guarded against re-entry: a chain the person declared moves along them, while an edge this file declares is offered only as a hint. `/bound` may supply an upstream boundary map, and the person may send the acceptance criterion's definition there. Predicate enforcement begins only through a separate user activation after Merismos emits.

## Known Limitations

Goal singleness, the host-contract subtraction, the out-of-scope classification, seam quality, horizon fit, the residual-versus-reservation classification, and a whole-goal condition's freedom from order are contextual judgments rather than proofs. They stay on the sheet, correctable by the person's next turn; the formal invariants certify the resulting plan structure, not the infallibility of those readings. That every obligation was read is itself a judgment: coverage checks the plan against the obligations read, not the reading against the goal.

## Rules

- **Separate activation**: Emission completes the epistemic work. Starting the autonomous interval is a separate constitutive act by the user.
- **No-reentry across the `/conduct` seam**: Carry the parked plan by navigation block rather than copying it. Fixed topology is not re-conducted, and a trivial unit arrangement bypasses `/conduct`.
- **Round composition**: Compose each round so the reader can act on it without reassembling it — everyday language rather than this file's formal vocabulary, the judgment set beside the evidence it rests on together with the differential implication that matters for the next move, and analytical context laid out before a gate rather than inside it. Read `references/round-composition.md` before composing when a term's rendering has to hold across the session or wording has to be carried through unchanged, when some of what is in view belongs to a later round or a trace rather than this one, or when this protocol's own phases bear on where a sentence sits relative to a gate.
- **One sheet, every turn**: Show the whole plan every turn — the goal, units, conditions, whole-goal conditions, the acceptance question, out-of-scope and subtracted obligations — every line drawn on every sheet, with the ledger of what the last turn changed. The plan and every question about it share that one sheet.
- **Recommendation only where the ground separates**: Mark an action as recommended only where the ground clearly separates it from the others; comparable actions stand side by side with their consequences.
- **The person takes and closes**: The plan is taken, stopped, or routed only by the person's turn, whatever its form. A taking adopts what the sheet showed and accepts the gaps shown; a value the draft proposed and the person took is recorded as the draft's and adopted, apart from values the person set. An answer to the focus closes nothing.
- **Contrary grounds ride the plan**: Show your contrary grounds before the focus. A reading of yours never refuses a taking; a plan taken over it carries it as dissent.
- **Whole certificate**: A unit's certificate carries every check, every accepted gap, and every held-open item of its done together; a passing check never stands for a done that a held-open judgment still awaits.
- **Whole-goal acceptance**: The acceptance question is settled once, by the person: a criterion (theirs or the draft's, taken), a reservation, or a waiver. One value stands; a later settling replaces an earlier one, and emission never carries two.
- **Host contract subtraction**: Exclude goal-independent host procedure from `O_G`; it is inherited process, not an out-of-scope obligation. A requirement the goal states as its own outcome remains in scope. Show what was subtracted on every sheet and in the trace, so a misjudged subtraction stays correctable.
- **One goal per apportionment**: A composite request relays its constituent outcomes and their shared-procedure bond; each outcome requires its own apportionment.
- **Reservation disposition**: Hold open an item only live judgment can settle, record the ground that settles it, and keep the classification on the sheet for correction. A reservation is neither an accepted gap nor a delegated pre-action obligation.
- **Convergence evidence**: Before deactivation, present the plan readback; each unit's obligations, seam, fit or the person's taking over it, whole certificate, capabilities, and feasibility; plan conditions; out-of-scope and subtracted obligations; the acceptance question as settled; each value's provenance with the turns read, quoted; the dissent the plan carries; and the navigation block over the parked carrier.
- **Form feedback**: Silence about form is not evidence about form. Too dense fails quietly — the reader skims, answers past it, stops — while too plain fails out loud, so the complaints that arrive come from one side only. Density therefore does not carry over from the previous round: each round takes it from what this request asked for, while a statement about form does carry over until it is countermanded. Read an instruction about form for the parts of a round it reaches, not for what kind of reaction it is — a complaint, a request, a symptom report and a bare preference are one input here, and sorting them by kind yields nothing the reach reading does not already give while costing a clause per kind. Change the form rather than asking which form they want; naming one is the recall this discipline exists to remove. What such an instruction reaches is whatever the active protocol leaves open in how a round is composed — its density, its ordering, its length. What it does not reach is whatever is already fixed for this round elsewhere: content the protocol requires, wording carried verbatim, an order it presents in, a cadence it caps, a turn boundary it sets. Those stay in place, and the layer that fixed them is what states why. Say in one line what changed; where the instruction overlapped something that stays, say in one line that it stays and why — that second line is owed by the overlap, not by how the instruction was worded.
