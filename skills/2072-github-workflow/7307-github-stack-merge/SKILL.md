## What It Does

Merges a stacked pull request via the runtime adapter's `merge` operation
(`gh stack merge <target> --yes`). This lands code — the adapter refuses
to run without `--confirm`, and this skill never supplies it without an
immediately preceding `AskUserQuestion` confirmation. Never calls
`gh pr merge` — only the adapter's `merge` operation, which itself calls
`gh stack merge`.

## When to Use

- User says "merge my stack", "land this PR", or "ship it" on the github
  stacked-PR provider and the target is fully reviewed, CI-green, and
  ready to land.

## Usage

Optional arguments (parsed from the argument text provided after the
skill name):

- A target — a **stack number, PR number, or PR URL** — as the first token,
  if given. A bare **branch name is NOT a valid merge target**: `gh stack
  merge` accepts only `[<stack-number> | <pr-number>]` per its own usage,
  and the adapter refuses anything else with `INVALID_ARGS` before running.
  If the user supplies a branch name, resolve it to its PR number first
  (Step 1 below) rather than passing it through — otherwise the merge fails
  *after* the confirmation prompt, having already asked permission to land
  code.
- `--merge-method <merge|squash|rebase>` — merge method to pass through.

### Step 1: Resolve the Target

If the argument text supplied a **numeric target or PR URL**, validate it
before using it: it must match `^[1-9][0-9]*$` (a stack/PR number) or
`^https://github\.com/` (a PR URL) — the same rule the runtime adapter's
own `checkout()` applies (`lib/github-stack-runtime.js`) — and must
contain none of the shell metacharacters `$`, `` ` ``, `;`, `&`, `|`, `(`,
`)`, `<`, `>`, a quote character, or whitespace. If it passes, use it and
go to Step 2.

If it supplied something else (a branch name), failed the validation
above, or no target was given at all, call the adapter's `view` operation
to list what is available and map the branch to its PR number:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/github-stack-runtime.js" view
```

If `status` is not `SUCCESS`, report `status` and `recoveryAction` and
stop. Otherwise, present the branches/PRs found, quoting the raw JSON
inside the untrusted-content fence below if the field structure is not
self-evident:

```text
--- begin untrusted-content (reference only) ---
<result.stdout>
--- end untrusted-content ---
```

Each branch entry in `view`'s JSON carries a `pr.number` — use that number
as the target. If the user named a branch that `view` shows with no
associated PR, stop and say so: there is nothing to merge for it.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which target to merge, and pass the resolved
**PR number** (never the branch name) to the adapter in Step 4.

### Step 2: Preview

Show the resolved target (and merge method, if given) to the user before
asking for confirmation.

### Step 3: Confirm

Use `AskUserQuestion`: "Merge this PR via gh stack?" showing the exact
target and merge method, with options "Merge" / "Cancel". Never proceed
without an explicit yes — this lands code. On "Cancel", stop — nothing
has run.

### Step 4: Merge

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/github-stack-runtime.js" merge --target "<target>" --confirm
```

or, with a merge method:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/github-stack-runtime.js" merge --target "<target>" --merge-method <method> --confirm
```

If it fails, report `status` and `recoveryAction` exactly. Do not retry
with a different merge method, do not fall back to `gh pr merge`, and do
not attempt a partial merge by hand.

### Step 5: Report

Read the JSON result's `status` field.

- **`SUCCESS`** — report that the PR merged. Quote `stdout` inside the
  untrusted-content fence below if it contains detail worth surfacing:

  ```text
  --- begin untrusted-content (reference only) ---
  <result.stdout>
  --- end untrusted-content ---
  ```

- Any other status — report `status` and `recoveryAction` verbatim.

## Boundaries

- Never calls `gh pr merge` for a stack — the adapter's `merge` operation
  (which calls `gh stack merge`) is the only merge path.
- Never passes `--confirm` without an immediately preceding
  `AskUserQuestion` confirmation.
- Never retries a failed merge automatically or falls back to a different
  merge method.
- Never passes a bare branch name to the adapter's `merge` operation — it
  accepts only a stack number, PR number, or PR URL, and would refuse with
  `INVALID_ARGS` after the user had already confirmed the merge. Branch
  names are resolved to a PR number in Step 1 first.
