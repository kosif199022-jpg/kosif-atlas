# Overlap Rules

When multiple scaffolding and setup tools apply to the same project, some include functionality that others also provide. These rules prevent duplicate work by specifying which tools to skip or scope down when another tool covers their output.

## Decision Table

Each row reads as: "If **Tool A** will run, then apply **Action** to **Tool B**, because **Reason**."

| Tool A                  | Tool B                    | Action         | Reason                                                                                                   |

Tool applicability (e.g., CLI-only tools not running on libraries) is defined in the **Applicability Rules** section below.

## Independent Tools

These tools have no overlap with any other tool and always run when applicable:

- **`set-up-secret-scanning`**: Secret scanning workflows are unique to this tool.

## Scope-Down Details

### set-up-linters after scaffold-go-library

`scaffold-go-library` generates `.golangci.yml` with full linter configuration. Skip Go-specific tools and only install cross-language tools:

- Prettier
- EditorConfig
- markdownlint-cli2
- Any other file-type-specific tools detected (Actionlint, yamllint, Hadolint, etc.)

### set-up-linters after scaffold-go-cli

`scaffold-go-cli` adds a Makefile `lint` target that calls `golangci-lint` but does not generate a `.golangci.yml` config file. Install `.golangci.yml` configuration plus cross-language tools.

### scaffold-new-repo after a Go scaffolder

Both `scaffold-go-cli` and `scaffold-go-library` generate LICENSE, README, .gitignore, and CHANGELOG. When scoped down, `scaffold-new-repo` should only generate agent config files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` (symlink to AGENTS.md)
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### set-up-linters after scaffold-rust-cli

`scaffold-rust-cli` generates `rustfmt.toml`, `deny.toml`, `typos.toml`, and configures clippy in the Makefile and CI. Skip Rust-specific tools and only install cross-language tools:

- Prettier
- EditorConfig
- markdownlint-cli2
- Any other file-type-specific tools detected (Actionlint, yamllint, Hadolint, etc.)

### scaffold-new-repo after scaffold-rust-cli

`scaffold-rust-cli` generates LICENSE, README, .gitignore, and CHANGELOG. When scoped down, `scaffold-new-repo` should only generate agent config files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` (symlink to AGENTS.md)
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### set-up-linters after scaffold-lean-library

`scaffold-lean-library` generates `lintDriver = "batteries/runLinter"`, the `_check-mathlib-cache` and `lean-lint` Makefile targets, baseline markdownlint and cspell configs, and split Lean/text CI workflows. Skip Lean linter wiring and do not create another CI workflow. Only add selected refinements:

- Additional cross-language tools the user explicitly selected and the Lean scaffolder did not generate
- Pandoc-academic preset refinements for paper-backed projects when the user selected them after scaffolding
- Updates to existing lint configs if the project was not freshly scaffolded

### scaffold-new-repo after scaffold-lean-library

`scaffold-lean-library` generates LICENSE, README, CHANGELOG, .gitignore, `AGENTS.md`, a safe `CLAUDE.md` symlink, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. When scoped down, `scaffold-new-repo` should only generate missing agent/config extras that the Lean scaffolder did not create, typically:

- `.claude/settings.json`

### pin-everything during bootstrap

`pin-everything` covers several surfaces: action SHAs, package-manager integrity pins, exact dependency pins, runtime version files, install commands, a Dependabot config, and an optional version-audit script. During a bootstrap it runs with `--scope dependabot` only, for two reasons:

- `set-up-ci`, `set-up-secret-scanning`, and the language scaffolders already emit SHA-pinned actions, so a full pinning pass would repeat their work on files written moments earlier.
- Exact-pinning dependencies and adding a version audit are choices about how the project manages versions, which the user should make deliberately rather than as a side effect of setup.

The Dependabot config is what a freshly scaffolded repository is missing: without it, every SHA pin the other tools wrote stays frozen at the version current on the day of the bootstrap. It runs last so the config covers every workflow and manifest the earlier tools created. When a `.github/dependabot.yml` or `.github/dependabot.yaml` already exists at plan time, the plan marks it `Already set up` and `pin-everything` does not run; the `review-dependabot-config` skill is the tool for checking an existing config.

### set-up-review-config during bootstrap

`set-up-review-config` overlaps no other tool's files, but what it writes depends on theirs, so it is not an independent tool. It detects file types to choose review checklists and reads the CI workflows to tell reviewers which checks to skip, so it runs after the scaffolders, `set-up-ci`, `set-up-linters` and `add-scrut-cli-tests`. It appends a `## Code Review Rules` block to the `AGENTS.md` that `scaffold-new-repo` or a scaffolder wrote. Where no tool wrote one, it creates `AGENTS.md` itself, asking first only when a regular `CLAUDE.md` already holds the repository's instructions, and a declined `AGENTS.md` leaves Codex without review rules and is reported as such. Running it after the scaffolders keeps that question from coming up in a bootstrap that writes the file anyway. Drift in an installed config later is for `refresh-project-scaffolding` to find.

## Applicability Rules

Some tools only apply to certain project types:

| Tool                      | Applicable when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
