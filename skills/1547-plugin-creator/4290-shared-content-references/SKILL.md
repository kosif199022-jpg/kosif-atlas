name: shared-content-references
description: Store instructional prose once and reference it from multiple skills or agents instead of duplicating it. Use when the same steps, rules, or reference material appear in two or more SKILL.md or agent files in one plugin, when deciding whether a shared doc belongs in the plugin-root docs directory or a single skill's references directory, or when tempted to use a symlink or a ../ path to share a file between components.

# Shared Content References

Resolve "where does the shared copy live?" for prose duplicated across two or more `SKILL.md` or
agent files inside one plugin.

## 1. Scope Gate

Applies when the same prose is needed by 2+ `SKILL.md` or agent files in one plugin.

Does not apply — route elsewhere instead:

- One skill's own content is too long → activate the `/plugin-creator:refactor-skill` skill
  (SK006/SK007 token thresholds).
- Deciding whether content belongs in a skill's `SKILL.md` body or its own `references/`
  directory (a single-skill boundary, not a cross-skill one) → activate the
  `/plugin-creator:optimize` skill or the `/plugin-creator:agentskills` skill.
- Sharing executable code (scripts, shell utilities) rather than prose → activate the
  `/plugin-creator:component-patterns` skill, §Shared Resources (`lib/` at the plugin root,
  accessed via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/`).

## 2. Placement Decision

    Start(["Same prose needed in 2+ places"]) --> Q1{"Consumed by components<br>in 2+ skill directories,<br>or by an agent<br>(agents have no references/)?"}
    Q1 -->|"Yes"| Root["Place in plugin-root docs/<br>Reference via Technique 1"]
    Q1 -->|"No — one skill plus<br>the agents it dispatches"| SkillRef["Place in that skill's references/<br>Reference via the ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR} form<br>from Technique 2"]

    Q2 -->|"Yes"| Index["Add an index skill (Technique 2)<br>so consumers load one skill<br>instead of repeating paths"]
    Q2 -->|"No"| Direct["Reference the doc directly<br>from each consumer<br>No index skill needed yet"]
```

## 3. Technique 1 — Plugin-Root Shared Doc

```markdown
[<doc name>](../../docs/<doc>.md) — contains <what>; read before <when>.
```

From `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` the relative link stays inside the plugin and needs no harness
support, so it is the primary form for a doc consumed across 2+ skill directories. Claude Code
also substitutes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in plain `SKILL.md` prose and markdown link targets;
write that form only in a plugin that targets Claude Code alone. Load
[verification.md](./references/verification.md) before relying on either form in a new,
unverified runtime.

## 4. Technique 2 — The Index-Skill Pattern

An index skill's own `SKILL.md` lists each shared doc with the annotation contract from
[annotation-format.md](./references/annotation-format.md):

```markdown
[<doc name>](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/<doc>.md) — contains <what>; read before <when>.
```

Every consumer skill or agent writes one sentence and never repeats a path:

```text
For <topic>, activate the /plugin-name:index-skill-name skill.
```

Moving or renaming a shared doc becomes a one-file edit inside the index skill.

Shared content lives inside the plugin that ships it. A doc in the surrounding repo is not
shared content — an installed consumer never has that tree, so the reference resolves for the
author alone.

## 5. Reference Files

Confirm each shared reference is present in every environment, bundled and reached by a
relative path inside the plugin, or inlined; otherwise inline, bundle, guard, or delete it. A
harness variable counts only where that harness substitutes it.

Load [annotation-format.md](./references/annotation-format.md) before writing any reference
link created by Technique 1 or 2 — defines what every reference must state and why.

Load [what-not-to-use.md](./references/what-not-to-use.md) before reaching for a symlink, a
`../` path, or copy-paste to share content across components — each fails for a documented
reason.

Load [verification.md](./references/verification.md) after adding or changing any shared
reference — canary, `skilllint`, and target-existence checks.

## 6. Related Skills

- `/plugin-creator:optimize` — the SKILL.md-vs-`references/` boundary within one skill; load
  first if the question is about one skill's own structure, not sharing across skills.
- `/plugin-creator:agentskills` — the Agent Skills Open Standard for cross-agent-product
  portability. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` are Claude-Code-specific and do
  not carry over to a portable skill.
- `/plugin-creator:refactor-skill` — one skill exceeding SK006/SK007 token thresholds; a
  different problem from N skills sharing content.
- `/plugin-creator:component-patterns` — §Shared Resources covers shared executable code
  (`lib/` at the plugin root), the code counterpart to this skill's shared prose.
- The `plugin-assessor` agent's cross-component duplicate-content check routes here for the remedy.
- The `start-refactor-task` skill's `CREATE shared references if specified` step routes here for
  what a shared reference is and how to create one.
