"""Report plugin runtime text that will not resolve for an installed consumer.

A plugin is distributed. Its runtime text is read by an agent whose working directory is the
consuming repo, which never had the authoring repo checked out. A path into that tree resolves
for the author and for nobody else, so the failure reaches real users and never reaches anyone
testing from the authoring checkout.

Runtime text is what loads with the artifact: ``SKILL.md``, agent and command bodies, and
``references/**``. Design-time siblings travel inside the package but never load
(``SKILL-GOALS.md``, ``MAINTENANCE.md``, ``BENCHMARKS.md``, ``maintenance/**``, ``evals/**``);
they are skipped, and a runtime link pointing *at* one of them is itself reported.

Four escape classes:

* ``repo-path`` — a path into the authoring repo's tree (``scripts/…``, ``rules/…``,
  ``tests/…``, ``docs/…``) that an installed consumer does not have.
* ``cross-plugin-path`` — a filesystem path into a sibling plugin.
* ``cross-plugin-skill`` — a ``<plugin>:<skill>`` activation of another plugin, reported with
  a same-line guard heuristic (see ``_GUARD_WORDS``) that triages but does not decide.
* ``design-time-link`` — a runtime link into a design-time artifact that never loads.

Three exemptions, and they are the spec rather than conveniences:

1. **Fenced blocks are never a finding.** The rule governs what the runtime agent is told to
   do. A fenced block shown as an anti-pattern is an illustration, not an instruction, so a
   document may quote every failure verbatim and still pass. Inline code spans and table cells
   are NOT exempt — real paths live in both, and exempting them would blind the check.
2. **Angle-bracket placeholders are exempt.** A token containing ``<`` or ``>``
   (``<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md``) names a shape, not a location. Generic examples
   belong in this form; an illustrative real path belongs in a fenced block instead.
3. **Variable-built paths are skipped, not verified.** A path on ``${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`` or
   ``${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`` is never reported. Claude Code substitutes both in a ``SKILL.md``
   body; whether any other harness does is unestablished, so this exemption under-reports.
   Tracked as issue #3445.

Cross-plugin references are matched against an allowlist read from the ``plugins/`` directory,
so label values (``state:verified``) and placeholders (``plugin:skill-name``) stay out of the
results without maintaining a denylist of things that merely look like references.

Usage:
    audit_runtime_escapes.py --plugin-dir plugins/<name> [--out REPORT.md]
    audit_runtime_escapes.py --all [--out REPORT.md]

Exit codes:
    0: no escapes found
    1: escapes found
    2: the requested directory does not exist
