**Use this guide when** building or modifying an AI agent or development tool to support the Agent Skills format — discovering skills, loading metadata, injecting into context, and handling script execution safely.

This guide explains how to add skills support to an AI agent or development tool.

## Integration Approaches

**Filesystem-based agents** operate within a computer environment (bash/unix). Skills are activated when models issue shell commands like `cat /path/to/my-skill/SKILL.md`. Bundled resources are accessed through shell commands. This is the most capable option.

**Tool-based agents** function without a dedicated computer environment. They implement tools allowing models to trigger skills and access bundled assets. The specific tool implementation is up to the developer.

---

## Overview

A skills-compatible agent needs to:

1. **Discover** skills in configured directories, including `.agents/skills/` for interoperability
2. **Catalog** concise metadata for model discovery
3. **Activate** a selected skill by loading full instructions
4. **Load resources** on demand rather than eagerly
5. **Retain or compact** activated content so it remains effective over time

---

## Skill Discovery

Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file. The agent should scan configured directories for valid skills.

---

## Cloud-Hosted and Sandboxed Agent Discovery

Filesystem-based discovery assumes the agent has access to the local filesystem. For agents running in containers, VMs, or cloud sandboxes this assumption does not hold. Three approaches cover the non-filesystem case:

- **Project-level skills travel with code** — Skills committed to a repository are available even in sandboxed environments because the repository is cloned into the sandbox. No extra provisioning is needed for project-level skills.
- **User-level skills need external provision** — Skills stored at the user level (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/`) are not present in a fresh sandbox. Provision them by cloning a config repository into the sandbox before agent startup, providing skill URLs the agent can fetch, or offering a web UI where users upload skills before starting a session.
- **Built-in skills as static deployment artifacts** — Skills that the product ships as part of its deployment image are always available in any sandbox. Package commonly needed skills as static assets in the deployment.

## Loading Metadata

At startup, parse only the frontmatter of each `SKILL.md` file. This keeps initial context usage low.

### Parsing Frontmatter

```
function parseMetadata(skillPath):
    content = readFile(skillPath + "/SKILL.md")
    frontmatter = extractYAMLFrontmatter(content)

    return {
        name: frontmatter.name,
        description: frontmatter.description,
        path: skillPath
    }
```

---

## Injecting into Context

Include skill metadata in the system prompt so the model knows what skills are available.

For Claude models, the recommended format uses XML:

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>pdf-processing</name>
    <description>Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, merges documents.</description>
    <location>/path/to/skills/pdf-processing/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>data-analysis</name>
    <description>Analyzes datasets, generates charts, and creates summary reports.</description>
    <location>/path/to/skills/data-analysis/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

**For filesystem-based agents:** Include the `location` field with the absolute path to the SKILL.md file.

**For tool-based agents:** The location can be omitted.

Keep metadata concise. Each skill should add roughly 50-100 tokens to the context. **Reason:** This keeps the system prompt within typical limits for skill discovery; excessive metadata can cause truncation and prevent skills from being auto-invoked.

---

## Structured Wrapping for Dedicated Activation Tools

When using a dedicated tool (rather than filesystem commands) to activate a skill, wrap skill content in XML tags so the model can distinguish it from other context and the harness can identify it during context compaction.

```xml
<skill_content name="pdf-processing">
  Skill directory: /path/to/skills/pdf-processing/
  Relative paths in this skill are relative to the skill directory.
</skill_content>
```

Do not imply that a client automatically inventories bundled resources. Load a referenced resource
only when the skill instructions or current task names the path.

## Security Considerations

Script execution requires safeguards to remain safe:

- **Sandboxing** — Run scripts in isolated environments
- **Allowlisting** — Execute scripts only from trusted skills
- **Confirmation** — Ask users before running potentially dangerous operations
- **Logging** — Record all script executions for auditing

---

## Trust Gates for Project-Level Skills

Project-level skills (committed to a repository) can come from untrusted sources when users open third-party repositories. Without a trust check, a malicious repository could inject skill instructions that execute arbitrary operations.

**Recommended approach:** Gate project-level skill loading on an explicit trust signal — for example, requiring the user to mark a directory as trusted before its skills are loaded into context. This prevents untrusted repositories from injecting instructions automatically.

## Permission Allowlisting for Bundled Resources

When an agent uses a permission system that prompts the user before file reads, bundled skill resources (files in `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`) will each trigger a permission dialog unless the skill directory is explicitly allowlisted.

**Recommended approach:** When a skill is loaded, add its directory to the agent's read-permission allowlist so the model can access bundled resources without interrupting the user for each file. Without allowlisting, every reference file access produces a confirmation prompt that breaks the user experience.

---

## Subagent Delegation (Advanced, Optional)

Some agent implementations support running a skill in a separate subagent session. In this pattern:

1. The main agent receives a user request and identifies the relevant skill.
2. The skill is loaded into a fresh subagent session with the full task as its prompt.
3. The subagent executes the skill workflow and returns a summary to the main conversation.

This is useful for complex skill workflows that benefit from an isolated context window. Support for subagent delegation is optional and varies between agent implementations.

## Reference Implementation

The [skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) library provides Python utilities and a CLI for working with skills.

**Validate a skill directory:**

```bash
skills-ref validate <path>
```

**Generate `<available_skills>` XML for agent prompts:**

```bash
skills-ref to-prompt <path>...
```

Use the library source code as a reference implementation for building your own skills integration.
