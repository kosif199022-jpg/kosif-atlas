"""Corroboration-weighting reducer for the ensemble-rule-review pattern.

Reads one fixed-schema findings file per worker, deduplicates findings on a
STABLE key (the worker's assigned group id plus the normalized location — never
the free-form rule slug, which differs between workers), counts how many
distinct workers independently reported each finding (the corroboration weight),
drops PASS verdicts and the low-weight tail, and prints a ranked report.

Fixed finding schema each worker emits (one block per finding, blocks separated
by the block-start field reappearing):

    - group: <stable assigned group/dimension id, identical across workers>
      rule: <free-form descriptive slug — NOT used for corroboration keying>
      location: <path:line>
      verdict: VIOLATION | PASS   # optional; absent means VIOLATION
      severity: critical | high | medium | low
      evidence: "<exact snippet>"

Why key on group, not rule: workers author their own `rule` slugs, so two
workers flagging the same defect emit different slugs. Keying corroboration on
the worker-authored slug would never corroborate. The `group` id is assigned by
the orchestrator (the rule-group number from the rotating split) and is therefore
identical across workers — the only stable corroboration key.

Usage:
    uv run reduce.py REPORT_DIR [--glob 'review-*.md'] [--keep-threshold N] [--slug-headings]

Worker id is the report filename stem (e.g. review-A.md -> "A").

`--slug-headings` is an explicit opt-in for heading-only locations (Markdown section
references with no line number): it slug-normalizes the heading portion so trivial
punctuation/casing differences corroborate. Off by default — `normalize_location`'s
legacy contract (return the stripped input unchanged when no line number is present)
is preserved for external consumers that import it directly, notably the
solid-review-ab scorer (examples/solid-review-ab/runner/scorer.py).

    Strips an absolute-path prefix down to the repo-relative path and trims whitespace,

    directories (e.g. `src/foo/config.py:10` vs `tests/foo/config.py:10`) must NOT
    collapse to one key, or unrelated findings would fabricate a false corroboration.

    When no line number is present (a heading-only location, e.g. a Markdown section
    reference) and `slug_headings` is True, the heading portion is slug-normalized so
    that trivial punctuation differences (em-dash vs hyphen, casing) do not fracture
    corroboration into separate keys for what is really the same location. This is an
    explicit opt-in: it changes the corroboration key space for every heading-style
    location, so external consumers that key on the pre-change contract (e.g. the
    solid-review-ab scorer, which imports this function directly) must not have their
    keys silently reshaped. `slug_headings` defaults to False and preserves the legacy
    contract: the stripped input is returned unchanged whenever no line number matches,
    regardless of whether a `:` separator is present.

    Args:
        raw: The raw location string to normalize.
        slug_headings: When True, heading-only locations (no line number) with a `:`
            separator get their heading portion slug-normalized. Defaults to False

        present; the `path:slug` string with any leading `/` stripped from the path
        and the heading slug-normalized when `slug_headings` is True and the location
