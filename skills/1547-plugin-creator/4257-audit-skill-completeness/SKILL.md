name: audit-skill-completeness
description: Evaluate a single skill's quality against its stated purpose. Classifies the skill's purpose type, then scores applicable quality categories — universal dimensions always apply; structural dimensions (scripts, references, assets) are scored only when warranted by the skill's purpose. A focused 20-line behavioral skill with no bundled resources scores fully on all applicable categories. Use when auditing skill quality, checking marketplace readiness, evaluating skill completeness, performing pre-publication evaluation.

# Audit Skill Completeness

## Core Principle

**The primary evaluation question is: "Does this skill have everything it needs to achieve its stated purpose reliably?"**

Scripts, references, and assets are extension patterns — each is warranted when the skill's purpose calls for it and unnecessary when it does not. Their absence is only a gap when the purpose requires them. A small, complete, purpose-aligned skill scores as complete; a skill with unused scripts and padding scores lower than one with clear, sufficient instructions.

## When to Use

- Pre-marketplace publication review — verify skill meets quality standards
- Post-creation quality check — evaluate newly created skills
- Skill improvement planning — identify specific quality gaps
- Marketplace readiness assessment — determine if skill is publication-ready

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discovery

Read the skill directory structure:

```text
skill-path/
├── SKILL.md          # Required - main skill definition
├── scripts/          # Optional - executable automation (when warranted)
├── references/       # Optional - supporting documentation (when warranted)
└── assets/           # Optional - reusable output resources (when warranted)
```

**Actions:**

1. Verify SKILL.md exists; report error and exit if missing
2. Read SKILL.md frontmatter and body
3. Note any scripts/, references/, assets/ directories and their contents

### Step 2: Classify purpose type

Classify the skill into one of these purpose types based on the frontmatter description and body:

| Purpose Type | Characteristics | Scripts | References | Assets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Behavioral / enforcement** | Teaches Claude how to approach a problem; enforces standards or constraints through instructions | Not warranted — behavior is internalized, not scripted | Only if domain-specific lookup needed | Not warranted |
| **Tool / format wrapping** | Wraps fragile operations on file formats (DOCX, PDF, XLSX, images) | Warranted — fragile transforms benefit from deterministic scripts | Warranted — format specs, schemas | Often warranted — templates |
| **Workflow orchestration** | Multi-step process coordination; skill-creation, plugin lifecycle | Often warranted — scaffolding scripts useful | Often warranted — process patterns | Sometimes |
| **Reference / knowledge** | IS the reference material; provides domain knowledge | Not warranted | The reference files ARE the product | Not warranted |
| **Domain expertise** | Encodes expert conventions (financial modeling, legal drafting) | Not warranted | Warranted — lookup tables, standards | Not warranted |

If the skill spans multiple types, apply the union of warranted categories.

### Step 3: Evaluate agentskills.io best practices (primary)

Apply the best-practice checks from [./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md](./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md) — section "agentskills.io Best Practice Checks". Rate each PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL with evidence from SKILL.md.

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Approach vs Output** | Is the skill scoped to a class of problems or a narrow one-shot recipe? |
| **2. Lean Instructions** | Does the skill over-specify, adding rules that narrow behavior without improving outcomes? |
| **3. Reasoning over Directives** | Does the skill explain the *why* behind its rules, or rely on bare imperatives? |
| **4. Description Trigger Accuracy** | Does the description generate a clear should-trigger / should-not-trigger boundary? |
| **5. Bundle Signal** | Are repetitive operations bundled, or will the agent re-implement them each run? |

For each check: state the verdict, cite specific evidence (file:line where possible), and note what an eval would test.

### Step 4: Evaluate structural quality categories (secondary)

The categories below are **universal** (always scored) or **conditional** (scored only when warranted by purpose; marked N/A otherwise).

**Universal categories:**

| Category | Evaluates |
|----------|-----------|
| **Preparation** | Prerequisites met before work begins |
| **Progression** | Concrete steps with right level of control |
| **Verification** | Output correctness confirmed before declaring success |
| **Examples** | Teaching through demonstration |
| **Anti-Patterns** | Explicit "what NOT to do" documentation |

**Conditional categories — apply warranted test first:**

| Category | Warranted when... |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Scripts** | The skill involves operations that are fragile, error-prone, or would be rewritten by the agent each invocation; deterministic code improves reliability |
| **References** | The skill requires domain-specific knowledge (API formats, schemas, conventions, standards) that an AI cannot reliably generate from training data |
| **Assets** | The skill produces output that uses templates, fonts, images, or boilerplate that should be bundled for use (not read into context) |

For each category:

1. **Warrant check (conditional categories only — Scripts, References, Assets):**
   - Ask: is this category warranted for this skill's purpose type (from Step 2)?
   - **If NO → record N/A. STOP. Do not execute steps 2–5. Do not add to score denominator. Do not list absence as a gap. Do not recommend adding it.**
   - If YES → continue to step 2.
   - Universal categories (Preparation, Progression, Verification, Examples, Anti-Patterns) always continue to step 2.
2. Read the category definition from [./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md](./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md)
3. Review checklist items for that category
4. Search SKILL.md and supporting files for evidence
5. Score 0–3 based on rubric (below)
6. Document findings with file:line references

### Step 5: Suggest eval scenarios

You do not have the domain context needed to author high-quality evals. Suggest scenarios that a domain expert can use as starting points.

For each best-practice check rated FAIL or PARTIAL, describe 1–2 prompts that would expose the gap (use the eval-type mapping in [./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md](./references/skill-completeness-checklist.md)).

Additionally suggest:

- **3–5 behavioral scenarios** — prompts where the skill would be active; note what the assertion should check (the agent's *approach*, not exact output)
- **2–3 should-trigger queries** — non-obvious prompts where the skill SHOULD activate (tests description trigger accuracy)
- **2–3 should-not-trigger queries** — prompts at the edge of scope where the skill SHOULD NOT activate

Format each as a short paragraph: the prompt idea, what makes it a good test, what a passing response demonstrates. Do NOT write JSON — the skill author needs domain knowledge to fill in the assertions.

### Step 6: Score and report

Calculate overall structural score. Denominator = 15 (universal) + 3 × (number of applicable conditional categories).

Write report to `.tmp/scratch/reports/skill-sync-{slug}-completeness-YYYYMMDD.md`. Create `.tmp/scratch/reports/` if it does not exist.

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Skill Completeness Report: {skill-name}

**Skill Path:** {path}
**Purpose type:** {type}
**Conditional categories applicable:** Scripts={Yes|No}, References={Yes|No}, Assets={Yes|No}

## Scoring Rubric

Each **applicable** category is scored 0–3:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **0** | None | Category not addressed — no evidence found |
| **1** | Minimal | Basic attempt, significant gaps |
| **2** | Adequate | Meets expectations, minor gaps |
| **3** | Exemplary | Fully addressed, matches Anthropic quality patterns |

**Universal category guidelines:**

- **Preparation (0-3):**
  - 0: No environment checks, no input validation
  - 1: Environment checks OR input validation present
  - 2: Both environment checks AND input validation present
  - 3: Full prerequisite verification, input inspection, structured pre-flight

- **Progression (0-3):**
  - 0: No clear workflow defined
  - 1: Workflow mentioned but steps are vague or incomplete
  - 2: Clear step sequence with decision points
  - 3: Clear steps, decision trees, degree-of-freedom calibration appropriate to task fragility

- **Verification (0-3):**
  - 0: No verification steps mentioned
  - 1: Manual verification suggested but not specified
  - 2: Verification steps defined with acceptance criteria
  - 3: Explicit error-correction loop (verify → fix → re-verify), expressed either as behavioral instructions Claude follows or as automated scripts — either form satisfies this level

- **Examples (0-3):**
  - 0: No examples provided
  - 1: Abstract descriptions or pseudocode only
  - 2: Concrete examples covering common cases
  - 3: Examples covering common AND edge cases, with exact input→output pairs

- **Anti-Patterns (0-3):**
  - 0: No anti-patterns documented
  - 1: Anti-patterns mentioned but not demonstrated
  - 2: Anti-patterns shown with corrections
  - 3: Anti-patterns shown with corrections AND reasoning for why the wrong form fails

**Conditional category guidelines (only when warranted):**

- **Scripts (0-3, or N/A):**
  - N/A: Skill's purpose does not involve deterministic or repetitive operations that benefit from scripting
  - 0: Operations clearly need scripting (agent would regenerate the same logic each invocation) but no scripts provided
  - 1: Scripts exist but the operations most likely to be regenerated wastefully remain unscripted
  - 2: Scripts cover the operations the agent would otherwise rewrite each run; eliminates the primary sources of wasted agent turns
  - 3: All deterministic operations that the agent would otherwise regenerate are scripted; scripts are self-documenting (--help) and handle edge cases — the agent never writes boilerplate

- **References (0-3, or N/A):**
  - N/A: Skill's purpose does not require domain knowledge beyond training data
  - 0: Warranted but no reference material bundled
  - 1: External links only — not bundled for offline use
  - 2: Reference files bundled, organized by topic
  - 3: Reference files linked from the specific workflow steps where they're needed

- **Assets (0-3, or N/A):**
  - N/A: Skill's output does not depend on templates, fonts, images, or boilerplate resources
  - 0: Output clearly requires bundled resources but none provided — agent generates required materials ad-hoc each invocation
  - 1: Some assets bundled but key output resources the agent needs are still generated ad-hoc
  - 2: Main output resources bundled; agent can produce its primary output without generating supporting materials
  - 3: All output resources the agent needs are bundled; agent never generates supporting materials ad-hoc; asset usage is clearly specified
