## Component Lifecycle

Every plugin component goes through two phases — discovery at startup and activation at runtime.

### Discovery Phase

When Claude Code starts, it processes each enabled plugin:

1. Scan enabled plugins — read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Discover components — search default and custom paths
3. Parse definitions — read YAML frontmatter and configuration files
4. Register components — make available to Claude Code
5. Initialize — start MCP servers, register hooks

Discovery happens once during Claude Code initialization, not continuously. Components added after startup require a session restart to become available.

### Activation Phase

Each component type activates through a different mechanism:

    User["User action"] --> Cmd["Command — user types /command"]
    Context["Task context"] --> Skill["Skill — description matches task"]
    Context --> Agent["Agent — capabilities match task"]
    Event["System event"] --> Hook["Hook — event matches registration"]
    ToolCall["Tool call"] --> MCP["MCP Server — capability matches call"]
```

## Component Selection Framework

Use this decision tree to select the right component type for a given need.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["What do you need<br>to add to your plugin?"]) --> Q1{"Does it need to<br>intercept or validate<br>tool calls or events?"}
    Q1 -->|"Yes — gate writes,<br>enforce policies,<br>inject context on events"| Hook["Use a Hook<br>Create with /plugin-creator:hook-creator"]
    Q1 -->|No| Q2{"Does it provide<br>external tool access<br>via API or process?"}
    Q2 -->|"Yes — database queries,<br>API calls, file processing<br>via external process"| MCP["Use an MCP Server<br>Create with /fastmcp-creator"]
    Q2 -->|No| Q3{"Does it need its own<br>identity, tools, model,<br>or permission scope?"}
    Q3 -->|"Yes — specialized worker<br>with restricted tools<br>or different model"| Agent["Use an Agent<br>Create with /plugin-creator:agent-creator"]
    Q3 -->|No| Q4{"Is it domain knowledge,<br>a workflow, or a<br>procedural guide?"}
    Q4 -->|"Yes — reference material,<br>multi-step process,<br>best practices"| Skill["Use a Skill<br>Create with /plugin-creator:skill-creator"]
    Q4 -->|"No — simple user-triggered<br>action with bash execution"| Command["Use a Command (legacy)<br>See /plugin-creator:command-development"]

    Hook --> HookNote["Events — PreToolUse, PostToolUse,<br>Stop, Notification, SubagentStop"]
    MCP --> MCPNote["Transports — stdio, SSE,<br>HTTP, WebSocket"]
    Agent --> AgentNote["Frontmatter — name, description,<br>tools, model, skills, hooks"]
    Skill --> SkillNote["Progressive disclosure —<br>SKILL.md + references/"]
    Command --> CmdNote["Legacy format —<br>prefer skills for new work"]
```

### Agent Security Profile — Plugin vs. Direct Install

Agents shipped inside a plugin have a restricted security profile compared to agents installed directly. Factor this into the decision framework above — not every agent capability works in every install path.

**Plugin-shipped agents have a restricted security profile:**

- `hooks` declared in frontmatter: silently ignored at runtime
- `mcpServers` declared in frontmatter: not supported
- `permissionMode` declared in frontmatter: ignored for plugin agents

Directly-installed agents (`.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`) support all frontmatter fields.

**Decision rule**: If an agent requires hooks for lifecycle automation, MCP server declarations, or custom permission modes — it must be directly installed, not shipped inside a plugin.

## Organization Patterns by Component Type

For detailed organization patterns (directory structures, scaling strategies, when-to-use guidance) for each component type, see [component organization reference](./references/organization-patterns.md).

Summary of available patterns:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Commands["Command Patterns"]
        CF["Flat — up to 15 commands"]
        CC["Categorized — 15+ with functional groups"]
        CH["Hierarchical — 20+ with nested structure"]
    end

    subgraph Agents["Agent Patterns"]
        AR["Role-based — distinct non-overlapping roles"]
        AC["Capability-based — technology or domain expertise"]
        AW["Workflow-based — pipeline stage specialists"]
    end

    subgraph Skills["Skill Patterns"]
        ST["Topic-based — knowledge and reference content"]
        SL["Tool-based — specific tool or technology expertise"]
        SW["Workflow-based — multi-step process automation"]
        SR["Rich resources — SKILL.md + references/ + scripts/ + assets/"]
    end

    subgraph Hooks["Hook Patterns"]
        HM["Monolithic — single hooks.json, up to 10 hooks"]
        HE["Event-based — separate config per event type"]
        HP["Purpose-based — grouped by security, quality, workflow"]
    end
```

## Cross-Component Patterns

When plugins grow beyond simple single-component designs, these patterns help manage complexity.

### Shared Resources

Components can share common utilities via a `lib/` directory at the plugin root:

```text
plugin/
├── commands/
│   └── test.md        # references lib/test-utils.sh
├── agents/
│   └── tester.md      # references lib/test-utils.sh
├── hooks/
│   └── scripts/
│       └── pre-test.sh # sources lib/test-utils.sh
└── lib/
    ├── test-utils.sh
    └── deploy-utils.sh
```

Access shared resources via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/` in scripts.

`lib/` covers shared *code*. For shared *prose* — the same steps, rules, or reference material needed by 2+ skills or agents — activate the `/plugin-creator:shared-content-references` skill instead.

### Layered Architecture

Separate concerns into layers for large plugins (100+ files):

```text
plugin/
├── commands/          # User interface layer
├── agents/            # Orchestration layer
├── skills/            # Knowledge layer
└── lib/
    ├── core/          # Core business logic
    ├── integrations/  # External service adapters
    └── utils/         # Shared helper functions
```

### Modular Extensions

Optional features as self-contained modules within the plugin:

```text
plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json
├── core/
│   ├── commands/
│   └── agents/
└── extensions/
    ├── extension-a/
    │   ├── commands/
    │   └── agents/
    └── extension-b/
        ├── commands/
        └── agents/
```

Register extension paths in `plugin.json` under `commands` and `agents`. Each field accepts a string or array and replaces its default scan, so every retained default-path component must be included.

## Best Practices

- **Reference only what ships** — confirm each path, command, fact, or cross-plugin reference in runtime text is present in every environment, bundled and reached by a relative path inside the plugin, or inlined; otherwise inline, bundle, guard, or delete it. A harness variable counts only where that harness substitutes it.
- **Start simple** — use flat structures, reorganize when growth demands it
- **Consistent naming** — match file names to component purpose using full descriptive words
- **Minimize nesting** — deep directory structures slow discovery and increase configuration burden
- **Use defaults** — rely on auto-discovery paths (`commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`) before adding custom paths to `plugin.json`
- **Separate concerns** — do not mix unrelated functionality in the same component
- **Plan for growth** — choose structures that scale without requiring full reorganization
