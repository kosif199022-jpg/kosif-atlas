## Creation-specific constraints

These points are not in the canonical reference but matter during authoring:

### YAML multiline indicator bug

Do NOT use YAML multiline indicators (`>-`, `|`, `|-`, `>`) for `description`. Claude Code's
indexer does not parse them correctly — the description displays as the literal `>-` characters
instead of the content.

```yaml
# WRONG — displays as ">-"
description: >-
  This agent reviews code for quality issues.

# CORRECT — single-line string
description: 'This agent reviews code for quality issues.'
```

### MCP tool names and server patterns

Name each MCP tool by its exact registered name, case-sensitive. Grant a whole server with
`mcp__<server>__*` or `mcp__<server>` — both forms grant every tool that server exposes and
compose with named tools. A plugin-bundled server registers as
`mcp__plugin_<plugin-name>_<server-name>`.

```yaml
# CORRECT — named tool
tools: Read, mcp__Ref__ref_read_url

# CORRECT — every tool from one server, plus Read
tools: Read, mcp__plugin_dh_backlog

# WRONG — wrong case matches no tool and is dropped
tools: Read, mcp__ref__ref_read_url
```

Author server grants with the bare form (`mcp__<server>`), not the `mcp__<server>__*` glob. Both
resolve identically at runtime, but `skilllint`'s AS007 check rejects the glob form and passes the
bare form (confirmed: `skilllint 1.10.0` exits non-zero on `mcp__plugin_dh_backlog__*` and clean
on `mcp__plugin_dh_backlog` for an otherwise-identical agent file) — an agent generated with the
glob form fails Phase 6 validation.

An entry that matches no live tool is dropped and the rest of the grant still resolves. When every
entry resolves to nothing the agent refuses to launch, reporting that it "would be spawned with
zero tools" and naming the unresolved entries.

A server pattern grants nothing while that server is disconnected. An agent whose `tools:` list
contains only MCP entries therefore cannot be invoked at all until the server returns — give it at
least one non-MCP tool unless that runtime dependency is intended.

## Validation

```bash
# Validate single agent file
uvx skilllint@latest check path/to/agent.md

# Validate current CSV or YAML-list tool forms without rewriting valid lists
uvx skilllint@latest check --fix path/to/agent.md

# Validate full plugin (when agent is inside a plugin)
claude plugin validate path/to/plugin/
```
