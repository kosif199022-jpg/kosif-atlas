# Copilot Feedback Resolver

Process and resolve GitHub Copilot's automated PR review comments systematically.

## PR Comments Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**NEVER leave comments directly on GitHub PRs.** This is strictly forbidden:

- `gh pr review --comment` - FORBIDDEN
- `gh pr comment` - FORBIDDEN (except the single required final workflow summary in step 7)
- Any GraphQL mutation that creates new reviews or PR-level comments - FORBIDDEN
- Responding to human review comments - FORBIDDEN

**This skill ONLY processes Copilot-authored feedback**, whether it arrives as a review thread or as a finding in a Copilot review body. Never interact with threads created by human reviewers.

**Permitted operations:**

- Fetch unresolved Copilot threads using the script's `fetch` command
- Fetch Copilot review-body findings using the script's `fetch-reviews` command
- Read existing PR comments (never write them) to check for prior summaries
- Reply to EXISTING Copilot threads using the script's `reply` command
- Resolve Copilot threads using the script's `resolve` command
- Reply and resolve in one step using the script's `reply-and-resolve` command

**Single exception:** Step 7 uses `gh pr comment` with `--body-file` to post one required final workflow summary after terminal workflow state once PR context exists. This is the ONLY permitted use of `gh pr comment` in this skill. The final summary is blocking: if it cannot be posted, the workflow is incomplete.

## Script Setup

All GraphQL operations use a dedicated script that handles pagination, variable binding, and Copilot author filtering automatically.

The script ships with this plugin. Invoke it via `bash` followed by the quoted path:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-copilot-threads" fetch OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
```

Claude Code replaces the plugin-root placeholder with the installed plugin's absolute, version-correct directory before this file reaches you, so there is no search step and no need for a shell variable. Keeping `bash` as the command prefix keeps the command token stable across plugin versions, which is what permission allowlist rules match on.

**If the path was not substituted**, it still begins with `$` rather than `/`. Codex CLI substitutes the placeholder only in hook commands, and OpenCode does not substitute it at all. In that case locate the script with `**/resolve-copilot-pr-feedback/**/scripts/resolve-copilot-threads`, prefer a match inside the harness's own installed-plugin directory, ignore any match under a `.bak` or other backup directory, confirm it with `test -x`, and use that absolute path for the rest of the session.

The examples below abbreviate that path to just `resolve-copilot-threads` for readability. They are not literal commands: expand the abbreviation when you run one, so every invocation is `bash`, then the **double-quoted** absolute path, then the arguments shown.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### YOU MUST RESOLVE THREADS AFTER ADDRESSING THEM

**After fixing any Copilot feedback, you MUST:**

1. **Push the code changes** (`git push`)
1. **Resolve EACH thread** using the script (see below)
1. **Verify resolution** by re-fetching the PR threads

**Addressing feedback without resolving the thread is INCOMPLETE WORK.**

The thread resolution is NOT optional - it's the primary deliverable of this skill. Code changes alone are insufficient.

### Thread Resolution Command (USE THIS!)

```bash
# Replace THREAD_ID with actual thread ID (e.g., PRRT_kwDONZ...)
bash resolve-copilot-threads resolve THREAD_ID
```

Outputs `true` on success. The `reply-and-resolve` command also outputs `true` on success.

**You MUST call this for EVERY thread you address.**

### YOU MUST UPDATE COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCORRECT FEEDBACK

**When Copilot feedback is categorized as INCORRECT (conflicts with project conventions/patterns), you MUST:**

1. **Update the project's Copilot instructions** to document the correct pattern
1. This prevents Copilot from flagging the same or similar things in future PRs
1. The update should be concise and explain why the pattern is intentional

**Failure to update Copilot instructions = INCOMPLETE WORK for Incorrect category feedback.**

#### Instructions File Strategy

Copilot supports two types of instruction files:

- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: General instructions for the whole repository
- **`.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md`** (path-specific): Targeted instructions with `applyTo` frontmatter

**Prefer path-specific instructions files** when the incorrect feedback applies to a specific language or file pattern. Use the repo-wide file only for conventions that apply broadly across the project.

#### CRITICAL: Make Sure Copilot Reads the File

An instructions file Copilot never loads does nothing, and nothing warns you. Location, not length, is the usual cause. Check all of these whenever you write or edit one:

1. **Location:** a path-specific file sits within or below `.github/instructions/` (subdirectories are allowed). A `*.instructions.md` directly under `.github/` is never read.
1. **Glob:** its `applyTo` matches the path of the file Copilot flagged. Separate multiple globs with commas.
1. **Agent:** `excludeAgent` is either absent or one of the supported strings `"code-review"` and `"cloud-agent"`. Reject any other value. For these review instructions, require the field to be absent or `"cloud-agent"`; `"code-review"` hides the file from PR review.

Copilot code review reads instructions from the pull request's head branch, so once pushed, the change governs the next review of the same PR. If the same finding recurs after that, re-check the three items above before adding more text.

#### CRITICAL: Keep Instructions Concise

GitHub advises limiting a single instructions file to about 1,000 lines, because response quality can decline past that and shorter files are more likely to be fully processed. To maximize effectiveness:

1. **Keep each instructions file under ~1,000 lines**
1. **Put the most important review rules first** in each file
1. **Start with 10-20 specific, actionable instructions** per file
1. **Split by concern**: use path-specific files instead of one large file
1. **Be specific**: clear, concrete instructions work better than vague directives

#### Path-Specific Instructions File Format

Place this file at `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md`:

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.go"
---

- **Pattern X**: Intentional in this project, do not flag
- **Pattern Y**: Required for Z reason
```

Use the `applyTo` glob to target specific languages or paths. Use `excludeAgent` to limit which Copilot agent reads the file. It accepts `"code-review"` and `"cloud-agent"`; `excludeAgent: "cloud-agent"` targets only code review.

#### General Instructions File (`copilot-instructions.md`)

Reserve for repo-wide conventions that apply to all file types:

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## PR Review

- **Pattern X**: Intentional, do not flag
- **Convention Y**: Required for Z reason

## Code Style

- General conventions here
```

---

## Processing Rules

**ONLY process UNRESOLVED comments. NEVER touch, modify, or re-process already resolved comments. Skip them entirely.**

## Skill dependencies

- **Required:** `lint-and-fix`
- **Optional:** None

## Core Workflow

### 1. Fetch ALL Unresolved Copilot Feedback

Copilot leaves feedback in two places, and **you MUST check both**. Fetching only threads is how real feedback gets missed.

```bash
bash resolve-copilot-threads fetch OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
bash resolve-copilot-threads fetch-reviews OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
```

The script automatically handles pagination and filters for Copilot-authored content.

Record the `OWNER`, `REPO`, and `PR_NUMBER` values used for the fetch. This establishes PR context for the required final workflow summary in step 7. If PR context or GitHub authentication cannot be established, report that the required final summary could not be posted and do not mark the workflow complete.

#### 1a. Threads (`fetch`)

**Output format** (JSON array):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "PRRT_kwDONZ...",
    "path": "src/foo.ts",
    "location": "src/foo.ts:42",
    "isOutdated": false,
    "comments": [{ "author": "copilot", "body": "[nitpick] Consider..." }]
  }
]
```

- **`location`**: Uses the first non-null of `line`, `originalLine`, `startLine`, `originalStartLine`. If all line fields are null, reports `path:(no-line)`.
- **Copilot detection**: Matches author logins `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`, `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, `copilot`, and `github-copilot[bot]`, plus `github-actions[bot]` when the comment body opens with a severity tag. Both `[bot]`-suffixed and unsuffixed forms are listed because GraphQL and REST report the same Copilot account differently, so one list serves both commands. The `github-actions[bot]` rule is the exception: it applies to `fetch` only. It keys on a comment body opening with a severity tag, and review bodies open with a verdict heading, so `fetch-reviews` has nothing to match on and uses the direct logins alone.

An empty array `[]` means no unresolved Copilot threads remain.

**`[]` from `fetch` is a statement about threads only. It is never proof that Copilot left no feedback.** Two separate things can hide behind it:

- Copilot may have filed findings in a review body instead of a thread. That is what `fetch-reviews` in step 1b is for, and you must run it before concluding anything.
- A previous attempt may have already done the work. Before using the no-op summary form, check whether this invocation is recovering from a prior failed summary-post step. If a previous run resolved threads or made code changes but failed to post the required final summary, reuse the preserved summary body from that run or reconstruct it from the prior local output, resolved review threads, branch commits, and branch diff. Do not downgrade that recovery summary to the no-op form just because a later fetch returns `[]`.

#### 1b. Review-body findings (`fetch-reviews`)

Copilot does not always open a thread. When it declines to comment on a line the latest push did not touch, it files the finding in the **review body** under a "suppressed comments" section and reports `Comments generated: 0 new`. Those findings are real and actionable, they have no thread id, and `fetch` cannot see them.

**Output format** (JSON array, one entry per Copilot review that has a body):

```json
[
  {
    "id": 5035762218,
    "url": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/54#pullrequestreview-5035762218",
    "submittedAt": "2026-08-21T18:02:11Z",
    "headline": "### 🔵 Needs a closer look\n\nThe Phase 2 plan section is internally inconsistent...",
    "verdict": "### 🔵 Needs a closer look",
    "hasSuppressedMarker": true,
    "hasFormatDrift": false,
    "suppressed": "### Suppressed comments (1)\n\n**docs/plans/todo/phased-build-plan.md:243**\n* This section now states...",
    "reviewBody": "### 🔵 Needs a closer look\n\n...",
    "findings": [{ "location": "docs/plans/todo/phased-build-plan.md:243", "path": "docs/plans/todo/phased-build-plan.md", "line": 243, "severity": null, "body": "* This section now states..." }]
  }
]
```

- **`findings`**: the structured parse. Treat each entry exactly like a thread comment, except that it cannot be replied to or resolved.
- **`verdict`**: the first `###` heading in the body. On `ccr-overview-v2` reviews it is the verdict heading, exposed separately from the lead paragraph in `headline`, and it is one of the drift check's inputs. Older layouts can report a section heading such as `### Reviewed changes`, or `null`, so read `headline` rather than `verdict` there.
- **`hasFormatDrift`**: the complete drift signal. It is true when a `ccr-overview-v2` review falls short of its own stated count, whatever else that review contains, and it is true when a review recovered no findings at all and either an old suppressed section announced some or a non-clean `ccr-overview-v2` verdict has nothing accounting for it. Only those last two require an empty parse.
  - **Shortfall**: the `**Findings:**` line states how many inline threads Copilot opened, as a severity breakdown whose counts are summed (`2 <medium> · 1 <low>` is three). A total above the number announced under `Open (N)` leaves findings this command cannot explain. So does a value reading as neither `None` nor a breakdown, and so does a `ccr-overview-v2` body with no `**Findings:**` line at all, since every such body carries one and its absence means the header was renamed. A shortfall reports drift whatever else the body contains, including on an approval and including when some findings did parse.
  - **Unexplained verdict**: a non-clean verdict is accounted for by threads under `Open (N)`, which `fetch` reports separately, or by a round that lists `Resolved since last review (N)` entries **and** whose lead paragraph is Copilot's fixed sentence naming no finding. Copilot ships a resolved section on most second and later rounds, including rounds that state their findings only in the lead paragraph, so the section alone is not enough.
  - `**Findings:** None` never clears drift by itself. The count says nothing about `Previously missed` entries or the line-less findings appended to file-summary cells: a review stating `None` can carry `Previously missed (3)`.
- **`suppressed`**: the raw section, verbatim, beginning with the line that announced it.
- **`reviewBody`**: the complete immutable review body for fallback inspection when a newer layout cannot be parsed.
- **`headline`**: Copilot's verdict and lead paragraph. Sometimes the only place a finding is stated; read it.

Review-body findings may have `line: null`. The `location` is then the normalized path alone, and `severity` preserves the textual severity that Copilot displayed. Never invent a line number.

**Format-drift rule (CRITICAL):** if `hasFormatDrift` is `true`, Copilot has changed its review-body layout. Read `suppressed`, then `reviewBody`, and extract the findings yourself. Open the review at `url` when the raw fields still do not make the concern clear. **Never treat a drift result as "no findings."** Report the drift in the step 7 summary so it gets fixed.

`hasSuppressedMarker` is computed from the review body itself, not from what the slice captured, so an announced-but-empty section still reports drift rather than looking like a clean review.

An entry with `hasFormatDrift: false` and an empty `findings` array carries no review-body findings. If every entry looks like that, and `fetch` returned `[]`, only then is there genuinely nothing to process.

#### 1c. Check for findings handled in a previous run

Copilot re-emits the same review-body finding in **every** later review until the underlying code changes. Review bodies are immutable, so a finding you fixed last run will still be there this run. Without a check, the skill would re-report or re-fix it forever.

Before acting on any review-body finding, read the PR's existing summary comments:

```bash
gh api --paginate repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/PR_NUMBER/comments --jq '.[] | select(.body | startswith("## Copilot Feedback Summary")) | .body'
```

`--paginate` is required. Without it only the first page of comments is inspected, so on a PR with a long comment history the prior summaries fall out of view and every review-body finding looks new again, which is exactly the re-processing this step exists to prevent.

This reads comments; it never writes one, so it does not violate the PR Comments Prohibition. Then, for each finding:

1. **Recorded before, and its disposition still holds.** A prior summary has a review-body row for the same finding: the same `path:line`, or for a line-less finding the same normalized path with a `Finding` excerpt that appears in this finding's `body`. That row usually links an earlier review, because Copilot repeats the finding in later reviews; the link records where the finding came from and is not part of its identity. Reading the current code confirms the recorded disposition still holds: for a `Fixed` row the fix is still in place, and for a `Noted` row (Incorrect, Outdated, or Nitpick) the code and evidence its rationale relied on are unchanged, so the same no-change decision applies. Record it as `Previously handled`, carry the prior disposition forward, and change nothing. A no-change finding never stops matching the code, so without this rule Copilot's repeats would be re-processed on every review.
1. **Recorded before, but no longer settled.** The earlier run deferred it, a fix regressed, or the code a no-change rationale relied on has changed since. Process it normally.
1. **Path matches, line does not.** Line numbers drift as files change. Treat it as a candidate and let the code check decide, rather than assuming it is new.
1. **Line-less path matches, excerpt does not.** No prior row for that path has an excerpt that appears in this finding's `body`. Treat it as a different finding. A file-summary review can carry several findings for one path, so the path alone is not an identity.
1. **No match.** Process it normally.

Always verify against the current code before deciding. Verification is what keeps this correct when someone edits or deletes a summary comment: the cost is a re-check, not a wrong answer.

### 2. Categorize Each Comment

For each unresolved Copilot comment **and each review-body finding**:

| Category      | Indicator                            | Action                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Nitpick**   | Contains `[nitpick]` prefix          | Auto-resolve immediately                                     |
| **Outdated**  | Refers to code that no longer exists | Reply with explanation, resolve                              |
| **Incorrect** | Misunderstands project conventions   | Reply with explanation, resolve, update Copilot instructions |
| **Valid**     | Current, actionable concern          | Fix directly, push, and resolve thread                       |
| **Deferred**  | Valid but out of scope for this PR   | Track in PROJECT.md, reply, resolve                          |

The same five categories apply to review-body findings, but the Action column does not: they have no thread to reply to or resolve. See [Review-Body Findings](#review-body-findings-no-thread) for what to do instead. Note also that review-body findings carry **no `[nitpick]` prefix**, so judge Nitpick from the prose rather than looking for a tag.

### 3. Resolve Threads

```bash
bash resolve-copilot-threads resolve THREAD_ID
```

### 4. Handle Each Category

#### Nitpicks (`[nitpick]` prefix)

- Resolve immediately without changes
- Optional brief acknowledgment reply

#### Outdated/Incorrect Copilot Comments

**CRITICAL: Reply directly to the Copilot review thread, NOT to the PR.**

**CRITICAL: Always use `--body-file` to pass reply bodies.** Write the response to a temp file first using the Write tool, then reference it with `--body-file`. This keeps the Bash command short and avoids permission prompts from long inline strings.

```bash
# Step 1: Generate a unique tmpfile path (-u so the file is NOT created):
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/copilot-reply-XXXXXX"
# Returns a unique path that does NOT exist on disk, e.g.: /tmp/claude-501/copilot-reply-r7s8t9

# Step 2: Write the response body to TMPFILE using the Write tool (not shown here as bash)

# Step 3: Pass TMPFILE to the script -- a SEPARATE call, issued after step 2 returns:
bash resolve-copilot-threads reply THREAD_ID --body-file TMPFILE

# Or reply and resolve in one step:
bash resolve-copilot-threads reply-and-resolve THREAD_ID --body-file TMPFILE
```

```bash
# Step 4: Clean up -- issue this as a SEPARATE Bash tool call, not chained onto step 3:
rm -f TMPFILE
```

Replace `TMPFILE` with the actual path returned by `mktemp -u`. The `-u` flag is required: plain `mktemp` creates an empty file at the path it prints, and the Write tool refuses to overwrite a file it has not Read first, so step 2 would fail with `File has not been read yet`.

**Never batch step 2 and step 3 into one message.** The reply script reads the body file at invocation time, so a parallel batch can run step 3 before the file exists and post an empty reply. This is a deliberate exception to the general preference for parallel tool calls: these two steps are dependent, because step 3 consumes the file step 2 produces.

The cleanup must be a separate Bash tool call: each tool invocation runs unconditionally, so the tmpfile is removed whether step 3 succeeded or failed, and the harness preserves step 3's exit code without any shell wrapping. Never combine the two with `; status=$?; rm -f TMPFILE; exit $status` -- in zsh (the macOS default shell), `status` is a read-only built-in alias for `$?`, so the assignment fails with `read-only variable: status`. See the `use-git` skill's tmpfile pattern reference for the full rationale.

**NEVER pass the reply body inline** (e.g., via `echo "..." |` or heredocs). Always use the Write tool + `--body-file` pattern.

**FORBIDDEN COMMANDS - NEVER USE:**

- `gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment` - adds PR-level comments, not thread replies
- `gh pr comment` - adds PR-level comments
- Any interaction with human reviewer threads

1. Reply to the thread with professional explanation:
   - Outdated: "This comment refers to code refactored in commit abc123. The issue is no longer applicable."
   - Incorrect: "This conflicts with our {convention name} convention. {Brief explanation}. See {reference file} for project guidelines."
1. Resolve the thread using `bash resolve-copilot-threads resolve THREAD_ID`
1. **Update Copilot instructions** to prevent recurrence:
   - **Prefer a path-specific file** (e.g., `.github/instructions/css.instructions.md` with `applyTo: "**/*.css"`) when the feedback targets a specific language or file pattern
   - **Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** only for repo-wide conventions
   - Example: `- Do not suggest removing .sr-only classes - required accessibility utilities`
   - **If symlink:** Follow it and edit target file
   - **Confirm Copilot will read it** against [Make Sure Copilot Reads the File](#critical-make-sure-copilot-reads-the-file)

#### Valid Concerns

1. Read the relevant file and understand the context around the flagged line
1. Fix the issue directly (edit the file, apply the suggested improvement)
1. Commit the fix (do NOT push yet; **Step 5: Lint and Fix** runs first)
1. Resolve the thread using the script

#### Deferred (Out of Scope)

**When feedback is valid but out of scope for the current PR:**

1. **Track the follow-up work** in the project's task tracking (e.g., GitHub issue, PROJECT.md, or similar)
1. **Reply to the thread** explaining the deferral:
   - "Valid suggestion. Tracked as follow-up task for a future PR."
1. **Resolve the thread**

**CRITICAL:** Never defer feedback without tracking it. "Acknowledged for follow-up" without creating a trackable task is INCOMPLETE WORK.

#### Review-Body Findings (no thread)

Findings from `fetch-reviews` have **no thread id**. Do not attempt `reply`, `resolve`, or `reply-and-resolve` for them; there is nothing to address those commands to, and the calls will fail. GitHub supports replies to line-level review comments, not to the immutable review body itself. Do not invent a thread or post an interim PR comment: the PR Comments Prohibition still applies, and the single step 7 summary is the reporting channel for these findings.

Apply the same categories, minus the thread operations:

| Category      | What to do                                                                    | Outcome recorded |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Valid**     | Read the flagged line, fix the issue, commit (do not push; step 5 runs first) | `Fixed`          |
| **Incorrect** | Update the Copilot instructions file so it stops recurring                    | `Noted`          |
| **Deferred**  | Track the follow-up work in a GitHub issue, PROJECT.md, or similar            | `Tracked`        |
| **Outdated**  | Confirm against current code, then record it; no code change                  | `Noted`          |
| **Nitpick**   | Record it; no code change                                                     | `Noted`          |

Every review-body finding gets a row in the step 7 summary and in the local audit table, whatever its category. Link its source to the exact review URL. A fixed finding names the fixing commit; an Incorrect, Outdated, or Nitpick disposition states the evidence or rationale for making no code change. Since Copilot will keep re-emitting the finding and there is no thread to resolve, that linked row **is** the record that it was handled, and step 1c reads it back on the next run.

If step 1b reported format drift (`hasFormatDrift: true`), extract what you can from `suppressed` or `reviewBody`, process those findings normally, and add a workflow-level failure noting that the review-body format changed and the parser needs updating.

### 5. Lint and Fix

**After all code changes are made (from Valid or Incorrect categories), run the `lint-and-fix` skill to catch lint errors before pushing.**

This step prevents CI failures from lint issues introduced while resolving feedback.

1. **Check for changes**: If no files were modified during steps 2-4 (only nitpicks auto-resolved or threads replied to), skip this step. Run `git status --porcelain` to verify: empty output means a clean working tree and you may skip; any output means files were changed and you should continue.
1. **Invoke the `lint-and-fix` skill** with `--no-push`:

   ```text
   lint-and-fix --no-push

   Parent continuation:
   - Caller: resolve-copilot-pr-feedback
   - Resume target: Step 6, push changes, re-fetch Copilot threads, then Step 7 summary comment.
   - On lint success: Continue immediately to Step 6 without asking the user for confirmation.
   - On lint failure or skipped required lint work: Record a workflow failure, skip Step 6 push and verification, then continue directly to the required terminal summary path in Step 7 because PR context exists.
   ```

   This runs all detected project linters and formatters, fixes issues, and commits the fixes without pushing.

1. If `lint-and-fix` reports `Lint status: success` or `Lint status: no-tools`, proceed to step 6. Any fix commits created by `lint-and-fix` will be included in the push.
1. If `lint-and-fix` reports unresolved lint issues, skipped required lint work, missing required tools, or tool execution failures, record a workflow-level failure. Do not claim lint success, do not push potentially non-compliant changes, skip step 6, and post the required partial or failed summary in step 7 because PR context exists.

### 6. Verify Completion

Do not run this step if step 5 recorded a lint failure or skipped required lint work. In that case, go directly to step 7 and report the lint failure in the final summary.

1. **Push any changes:** `git push`
1. Re-fetch to confirm all Copilot threads resolved:

   ```bash
   bash resolve-copilot-threads fetch OWNER REPO PR_NUMBER
   ```

   Expected output: `[]` (empty array)

   **Do not re-run `fetch-reviews` as a completion check.** Review bodies are immutable, so a review-body finding you just fixed still appears in the old body and always will. It will never go empty, and treating it as a verification signal produces a false Partial forever. Only the thread `fetch` is expected to reach `[]`.

1. Determine terminal workflow status and counts:
   - **No unresolved Copilot feedback**: the initial `fetch` returned `[]` **and** `fetch-reviews` surfaced no findings needing attention or format drift (every entry had `hasFormatDrift: false`, and every finding was absent or `Previously handled`). Never use this status without having run `fetch-reviews`.
   - **Completed**: Every fetched thread and every review-body finding was handled according to its category, no failed or pending items remain, and any required code changes were pushed
   - **Partial**: At least one fetched thread or review-body finding was handled, but one or more items, replies, resolutions, tracking items, instruction updates, lint runs, pushes, or verification checks failed or remain pending
   - **Failed**: The workflow could not fetch or process feedback, or no required processing step succeeded
1. Track feedback metrics separately from workflow-level failures. Feedback metrics cover fetched, resolved, pending, failed, deferred, code-change, review-body, and previously handled items. Workflow-level failures cover non-thread steps such as instruction updates, follow-up tracking, lint runs, pushes, verification checks, and review-body format drift.
1. Proceed to step 7 before claiming completion

### 7. Post PR Summary Comment

**Required:** Once PR context exists, always post exactly one final PR summary comment after terminal workflow state. Do this for every outcome: no unresolved comments, fully resolved comments, only non-code-change resolutions, code-change resolutions, partial processing, failures, and pending items.

Post a summary comment to the PR so reviewers can see the workflow outcome at a glance. Do not post interim PR comments.

**Comment format:**

```markdown

```

- Status must be one of `Completed`, `No unresolved Copilot feedback`, `Partial`, or `Failed`
- **`Source`** is `Thread` or a `Review body REVIEW_ID` link using the exact `url` returned by `fetch-reviews`. Review-body findings have no thread, so this link visibly connects the disposition to the immutable source review.
- **`Finding`** is `path:line` when a line exists. For `line: null`, use the normalized path plus a concise excerpt copied verbatim from `body`, so step 1c can find it in the `body` of a repeated finding; a path alone is ambiguous when one table row carries several findings. Choose an excerpt that contains no `|` character: a pipe would end the table cell, and escaping it as `\|` would stop the cell text from appearing verbatim in `body`. Any distinctive run of words from `body` works, so pick one that sits between pipes.
- **`Outcome`** for `Thread` rows is `Resolved`, `Failed`, or `Pending`. `Resolved` means a thread was actually resolved, so it is never correct for a `Review body` row. Those use `Fixed`, `Tracked`, `Noted`, `Previously handled`, or `Failed`.
- **`Disposition`** names the fixing commit for `Fixed` and fixed `Previously handled` rows. For `Incorrect`, `Outdated`, and `Nitpick` rows, state the evidence or rationale for making no code change. Do not leave a category-only disposition that forces readers to reconstruct the decision.
- The trailing `Counts:` line is one short sentence at the end of the comment. Include only non-zero counts from this set: fetched, resolved, pending, failed, deferred, code-change threads, review-body findings, previously handled, workflow failures. Omit zero-valued metrics; do not render an empty table or "0" entries. If every count is zero, omit the `Counts:` line entirely.
- Pluralize naturally (`1 fetched`, `2 fetched`; `1 code-change thread`, `2 code-change threads`; `1 review-body finding`, `2 review-body findings`; `1 workflow failure`, `2 workflow failures`).
- Table includes all processed threads and review-body findings when the comment remains safely postable, not only Valid and Incorrect items
- If the table would make the PR comment too large, replace thread details with aggregate category/outcome rows first and state how many detail rows were omitted. Keep the full row-by-row table in the local final output for the agent/user audit trail. **Never aggregate away a review-body source link or finding identity**, since step 1c reads those back to avoid re-processing on the next run.
- Incorrect category notes Copilot instruction additions in the Disposition column
- Thread IDs omitted (meaningless to human reviewers)
- Non-thread failures, including review-body format drift, must be described in a failure details section, not forced into the feedback table

If neither the thread fetch nor the review-body fetch surfaced anything needing attention, use this no-op form:

```markdown
## Copilot Feedback Summary

Status: No unresolved Copilot feedback
Head SHA: `abc1234`

No unresolved Copilot threads and no review-body findings were found.
```

**Only use this form after running `fetch-reviews`.** An empty `fetch` alone does not justify it.

If processing was partial or failed, include failure details, the remaining required action, and the trailing counts line:

```markdown
## Copilot Feedback Summary

```

**No-op summary idempotency:** Before posting a `No unresolved Copilot feedback` summary, inspect existing top-level PR comments for a `## Copilot Feedback Summary` comment with the same head SHA and no-op status. If one already exists and this invocation did not recover a failed summary-post attempt, do not add another no-op comment. Report the existing summary comment URL locally and treat that existing same-head no-op summary as satisfying the final summary requirement for this no-op run. This idempotency exception applies only to runs where **both** the thread fetch and the review-body fetch came back with nothing needing attention; if this invocation processed threads or review-body findings, made code changes, or is recovering a failed summary-post attempt, post the required outcome summary.

**Mechanics:**

```bash
# Step 1: Generate a unique tmpfile path (-u so the file is NOT created):
mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/copilot-summary-XXXXXX"
# Returns a unique path that does NOT exist on disk, e.g.: /tmp/claude-501/copilot-summary-k2m9p4

# Step 2: Write comment body to TMPFILE using the Write tool (not shown here as bash)

# Step 3: Post the comment -- a SEPARATE call, issued after step 2 returns:
gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --body-file TMPFILE
```

```bash
# Step 4: Clean up -- issue this as a SEPARATE Bash tool call, not chained onto step 3:
rm -f TMPFILE
```

Replace `OWNER`, `REPO`, `PR_NUMBER`, and `TMPFILE` with actual values recorded during fetch. Always pass `--repo OWNER/REPO` so the final summary targets the intended PR even if the current checkout or working directory changes. The cleanup must be a separate Bash tool call (see [Outdated/Incorrect Copilot Comments](#outdatedincorrect-copilot-comments) above for the rationale): chaining with `; status=$?; rm -f TMPFILE; exit $status` breaks under zsh because `status` is a read-only built-in alias for `$?`.

If the comment fails, log the error and do not claim completion. Thread resolution, code changes, and the required final PR summary are all workflow deliverables.

When the final summary comment fails, preserve the exact intended summary Markdown in the local final output. A later retry must use that preserved body, or reconstruct the same outcome from available PR and git evidence, before falling back to any no-op summary.

## Reply Templates

First, generate a unique tmpfile path with `mktemp -u "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/copilot-reply-XXXXXX"` (the `-u` keeps `mktemp` from creating the file, which would block the Write tool). Write these to the returned path using the Write tool, then, in a **separate message**, pass the path via `--body-file`. Never batch the Write and the reply command together: the command reads the file at invocation time, so a parallel batch can post an empty reply. Clean up the tmpfile (`rm -f TMPFILE`) after each reply operation as a **separate Bash tool call**, not chained onto the reply command.

**For outdated comments:**

```text
This comment refers to code that has been refactored in commit [hash]. The issue is no longer applicable.
```

**For incorrect/convention conflicts:**

```text
This suggestion conflicts with our {convention name} convention. {Brief explanation of why}. See {reference file} for project guidelines.
```

## Success Criteria

**Task is INCOMPLETE until ALL of these are done:**

1. All code changes pushed to the PR branch
1. **BOTH `fetch` and `fetch-reviews` were run** (a thread fetch alone cannot see review-body findings)
1. **EVERY addressed thread resolved via the script** (not just code fixed!)
1. **EVERY review-body finding handled and recorded** in the step 7 summary, since there is no thread to resolve and the summary row is the only record
1. **For INCORRECT feedback: Copilot instructions updated** (path-specific `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` preferred, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repo-wide conventions)
1. **For DEFERRED feedback: Task tracked** (GitHub issue, PROJECT.md, or similar)
1. **Linters and formatters pass** (via `lint-and-fix` skill, if any files were changed while addressing feedback)
1. Re-fetch confirms empty array `[]` for all processed **threads**. This does not apply to `fetch-reviews`, which never empties.
1. Output summary table (see format below)
1. **Final PR summary comment posted via step 7** after terminal workflow state, once PR context exists. For empty-fetch no-op runs only, an existing same-head no-op summary may satisfy this requirement without adding a duplicate comment.

If PR context or GitHub authentication is unavailable, or if `gh pr comment` fails, the workflow is incomplete. Report the failure locally and include the remaining action needed to post the required summary.

### Required Output: Feedback Summary Table

```

**Column definitions:**

- **Source**: `Thread` or an exact originating review link
- **Thread ID**: GraphQL thread ID (truncated for readability); `--` for review-body findings, which have none
- **Finding**: `path:line`, or normalized path plus identifying text when the finding has no line
- **Category**: Nitpick, Valid, Outdated, Incorrect, or Deferred
- **Action taken**: Brief description of resolution (10 words max)
- **Status**: `Resolved`, `Failed`, or `Pending` for threads; `Fixed`, `Tracked`, `Noted`, `Previously handled`, or `Failed` for review-body findings

**Common failure modes:**

- Fixing code but forgetting to resolve the threads. This leaves the PR with unresolved conversations even though the issues are fixed. ALWAYS run the resolution command after pushing code.
- Reporting `No unresolved Copilot feedback` on the strength of an empty `fetch` alone. Copilot regularly files findings in review bodies where a thread query cannot see them, and this reads as success while real feedback goes unread. ALWAYS run `fetch-reviews` too.

## Error Handling

- API failures: Retry with proper auth
- Thread ID issues: Use alternative queries
- Review-body format drift (`hasFormatDrift: true`): inspect `suppressed` and `reviewBody`, process the findings you can recover, and record a workflow failure so the parser gets updated. Never report this as "no findings."
- Fix failures: Retry with alternative approach or defer if out of scope
- Summary comment failures: Log the error, preserve the intended summary Markdown in the local final output, and treat the workflow as incomplete until the required final summary posts successfully
- Partial resolution is better than none, but a partial or failed terminal state still requires the final PR summary once PR context exists
