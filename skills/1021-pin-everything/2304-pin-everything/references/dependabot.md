# Dependabot Configuration

How to write `.github/dependabot.yml` for repositories that have been pinned by this skill.

## Why Dependabot Matters Even More After Pinning

SHA-pinning is a one-shot hardening pass; without something keeping pins current, they rot. Dependabot is the standard mechanism for proposing version bumps automatically, opening one PR per outdated dependency on a schedule. Once SHA pins are in place, Dependabot's PR diffs become more readable (the `# vX.Y.Z` comment is what users see in the diff title) and easier to review.

The configuration below is structured around the post-pinning workflow:

- **Weekly schedule** -- daily is too noisy when every action and every dep gets its own PR.
- **Split groups by update-type** -- minor/patch can auto-merge later (separate concern); majors get human review.
- **10-PR cap per ecosystem** -- raised from the default of 5 because SHA-pinning produces finer-grained PRs than tag-pinning.
- **`versioning-strategy: increase` for `npm`** -- tells Dependabot to bump the existing exact pin instead of widening the range. Without this, Dependabot will rewrite `"prettier": "3.8.3"` as `"prettier": "^3.9.0"` on the next bump, undoing step 6.

## Template

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    groups:
      actions-minor-patch:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: [minor, patch]
      actions-major:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: [major]
    commit-message:
      prefix: chore
      include: scope

  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    versioning-strategy: increase
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    groups:
      npm-minor-patch:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: [minor, patch]
      npm-major:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: [major]
    commit-message:
      prefix: chore
      include: scope
```

The `github-actions` block applies when the repo has `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `*.yaml` files, or a composite `action.yml` or `action.yaml` with an external `uses:` step; drop it otherwise, since an entry with nothing to update is itself a config finding. The `npm` block applies when a `package.json` is present without `bun.lock` or `bun.lockb`; drop it otherwise. A `package.json` beside only the legacy binary `bun.lockb` gets no block at all, since Dependabot cannot read that lockfile: tell the user to migrate to the text `bun.lock` first. Add a `- package-ecosystem:` block for every other ecosystem present in the repo:

| Ecosystem present | Detection                                                          | Add block with `package-ecosystem:` |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Bun               | `package.json` with `bun.lock`                                     | `bun`                               |
| Deno              | `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc`                                        | `deno`                              |

| Pip (Python)      | `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `requirements*.txt`, no `uv.lock` | `pip`                               |
| Conda             | `environment.yml`                                                  | `conda`                             |

| Swift             | `Package.swift`, or `Package.resolved` in an Xcode project         | `swift`                             |
| Docker            | `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.*`, `*.Dockerfile`, or `Containerfile`   | `docker`                            |
| Docker Compose    | `docker-compose.yml` or `.yaml`, `compose.yml` or `.yaml`          | `docker-compose`                    |
| Helm              | `Chart.yaml`                                                       | `helm`                              |
| Terraform         | `*.tf`                                                             | `terraform`                         |
| OpenTofu          | `*.tf` or `*.tofu` in a project run with OpenTofu                  | `opentofu`                          |
| Dev containers    | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or `.devcontainer.json`          | `devcontainers`                     |
| Git submodules    | `.gitmodules`                                                      | `gitsubmodule`                      |
| pre-commit        | `.pre-commit-config.yaml`                                          | `pre-commit`                        |
| Nix               | `flake.nix` with `flake.lock`                                      | `nix`                               |
| Bazel             | `MODULE.bazel`                                                     | `bazel`                             |

The same shape applies -- weekly schedule, split groups, 10-PR cap, `commit-message` prefix. `gitsubmodule` and `nix` update to commit revisions, which carry no minor, patch, or major, so give them one group with `patterns: ["*"]` and no `update-types`. For a manifest this table does not list, check GitHub's supported ecosystems page and add a block of the same shape.

## `versioning-strategy` Per Ecosystem

| Ecosystem        | Strategy                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm`            | `versioning-strategy: increase` (preserves exact pins from step 6)               |
| `cargo`          | _no strategy needed_ (cargo is exact-version-by-default for `=X.Y.Z` pins)       |
| `pip`            | `versioning-strategy: increase` if you've pinned to `==X.Y.Z`; default otherwise |
| `uv`             | _leave the default_; `uv.lock` records the exact resolution                      |
| `bundler`        | _no strategy field_; uses the lockfile as the source of truth                    |
| `gomod`          | _no strategy field_; uses `go.sum` as the source of truth                        |
| `github-actions` | _no strategy field_; SHA pins with `# vX.Y.Z` comments are bumped one-for-one    |

## What Dependabot Does Not Cover

Four surface families are outside Dependabot's scope:

1. **Language version files** -- `.tool-versions`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.ruby-version`, `.python-version`. `rust-toolchain.toml` is not one of them: the `rust-toolchain` ecosystem in the table above tracks it. There's no Dependabot ecosystem for any of these per-language pin files (asdf-style `.tool-versions` and the per-language fallback files are silent surfaces). Drift accumulates until something triggers a manual bump.
2. **`packageManager` field** -- Dependabot recognizes the field but does not propose updates to it.
3. **Action SHAs in `.md` templates** -- Dependabot only scans workflow files, not markdown.
4. **Install-command pins inside scripts** -- `go install`, `cargo install`, `pip install`, `npx <tool>@X.Y.Z` lines in shell scripts and Makefiles are invisible to Dependabot.

These four surface families are exactly what the bundled `version-audit-template` covers (step 10 of the skill). After enabling Dependabot, generate the audit script too -- together they cover everything.

## Conflicting Existing Config

If `.github/dependabot.yml` (or `.github/dependabot.yaml`) already exists, do not overwrite, and do not add a second file beside it. Merge:

1. Read the existing config.
2. For each ecosystem block already present: keep the user's `schedule`, `directory`, and any `groups` they've defined. If their `open-pull-requests-limit` is below 10, suggest raising it. If `versioning-strategy` is missing for `npm` or `pip` (after step 6 pinning), suggest adding `increase`.
3. For each ecosystem present in the repo but missing from the config: add a new block from the template.
4. Show the diff before writing. Let the user accept, modify, or skip.

To audit an existing config in depth instead (coverage of every directory, validity against current Dependabot options, labels, commit messages, and the repository settings and secrets Dependabot depends on), use the `review-dependabot-config` skill.

## Auto-Merge Wiring (Optional, Out of Scope for This Skill)

The `*-minor-patch` group exists to make later auto-merge wiring simple. A separate workflow (out of scope for `pin-everything`) can listen for Dependabot PRs against that group and merge them after CI passes. Major bumps stay in the `*-major` group for human review. Set up that wiring with a dedicated skill or hand-rolled workflow once you have confidence in your CI.
