# Corepack Integrity Pinning and `.yarnrc.yml` Hardening

How to integrity-pin Yarn or pnpm via Corepack, make `.yarnrc.yml` security defaults explicit (Yarn-only), and detect harmful Corepack-migration side effects.

## Why Integrity-Pin the `packageManager` Field

`package.json`'s `"packageManager": "yarn@4.14.1"` (or `"pnpm@9.12.3"`) field tells Corepack which package manager to use, but the version alone is not enough -- Corepack will fetch the matching artifact at install time: Yarn 2+'s standalone `yarn.js` bundle from `repo.yarnpkg.com`, or pnpm's `.tgz` tarball from `registry.npmjs.org`. If that artifact has been tampered with (or if the registry is compromised), every developer and every CI run silently picks up the malicious binary.

The `+sha512.<hash>` suffix turns the field into a cryptographic commitment to that specific artifact: `"packageManager": "yarn@4.14.1+sha512.64df448055..."`. Corepack verifies the downloaded artifact's hash against the suffix and refuses to activate if they don't match. Tampering becomes detectable. The same suffix mechanism applies to pnpm (over its tarball).

## Computing the SHA-512 Hash

### Preferred: Let Corepack Compute It

```bash
corepack use yarn@4.14.1
jq -r '.packageManager' package.json
# → yarn@4.14.1+sha512.64df448055b2d37ba269d7db535a469b8da93f8ef1140c25fd7a83c00a8fbaacb214ca0e02553b92a2c54cef78bb67d0b4817fab02001df0e24fac0faccc3b42
```

`corepack use` downloads the requested Yarn version, computes the integrity hash, and writes the suffixed form into `packageManager` -- all in one command. This is the path Yarn's documentation recommends. The closely-named `corepack prepare yarn@X.Y.Z --activate` only prepares and activates the binary globally; it does not modify `package.json`, so it will not produce the integrity-pinned field on its own.

### Fallback: Compute by Hand

If Corepack isn't available, fetch the artifact and compute SHA-512 directly. For Yarn 2+, the artifact is the standalone `yarn.js` bundle (not a tarball). Use `shasum -a 512` for portability: it's preinstalled on macOS and most Linux distributions, while `sha512sum` (GNU coreutils) is Linux-only and absent from a stock macOS install.

```bash
VERSION=4.14.1
HASH=$(
  curl -fsSL "https://repo.yarnpkg.com/${VERSION}/packages/yarnpkg-cli/bin/yarn.js" \
    | shasum -a 512 \
    | awk '{print $1}'
)
```

Then update `package.json`:

```bash
jq --arg pm "yarn@${VERSION}+sha512.${HASH}" '.packageManager = $pm' package.json > package.json.tmp \
  && mv package.json.tmp package.json
```

### Verification

After writing the suffixed `packageManager` field:

```bash
corepack enable
yarn --version  # must print the pinned version
```

If the hash is wrong, Corepack errors out with a mismatch message instead of running.

## `.yarnrc.yml` Security-Strict Defaults

Yarn 2+ reads `.yarnrc.yml` for configuration. Several settings have permissive defaults that a future Corepack migration (or a misguided "one-time fix") can flip on:

```yaml
enableScripts: false
enableTelemetry: false
defaultSemverRangePrefix: ""
```

| Setting                    | Default | Pin to  | Why                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enableScripts`            | `true`  | `false` | Blocks arbitrary `postinstall` scripts. Most supply-chain attacks against npm-style ecosystems run during install hooks; this disables them.    |
| `enableTelemetry`          | `true`  | `false` | Yarn phones home with anonymized usage data by default. Disable as a matter of policy.                                                          |
| `defaultSemverRangePrefix` | `^`     | `""`    | When `yarn add <pkg>` writes a new dependency, the empty prefix produces an exact pin instead of a caret range -- keeps step 6 from regressing. |

Make these explicit even if they happen to match the default -- explicit config survives `yarn set version`, Corepack migrations, and version bumps. Implicit defaults can change.

## Harmful Corepack-Migration Additions

Some Corepack workflows add settings that weaken security. Detect and revert these:

| Setting                                      | Harm                                                                                     | Revert                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `approvedGitRepositories: ["**"]`            | Permits arbitrary git sources for `yarn add <git-url>`, bypassing the registry entirely. | Remove the line or restrict to specific repos     |
| `enableScripts: true`                        | Re-enables postinstall scripts.                                                          | Set to `false`                                    |
| `npmAlwaysAuth: true` (with public packages) | Forces auth on public registry requests, often masking misconfigured tokens.             | Remove unless you actually use a private registry |

Read `.yarnrc.yml` and warn the user before removing entries that look intentional (e.g. a private registry config).

## pnpm via the Same `packageManager` Field

The `packageManager` field is Corepack's surface for both Yarn and pnpm: `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.X.Y+sha512.<hash>"` works exactly the same way as the Yarn form. Run `corepack use pnpm@X.Y.Z` (not `corepack prepare`, which does not modify `package.json`) to write the integrity-suffixed form. The fallback hand-computation pulls the tarball from npm directly:

```bash
VERSION=9.12.3
HASH=$(
  curl -fsSL "https://registry.npmjs.org/pnpm/-/pnpm-${VERSION}.tgz" \
    | shasum -a 512 \
    | awk '{print $1}'
)
jq --arg pm "pnpm@${VERSION}+sha512.${HASH}" '.packageManager = $pm' package.json > package.json.tmp \
  && mv package.json.tmp package.json
corepack enable && pnpm --version
```

The `.yarnrc.yml` defaults section above is Yarn-specific. pnpm uses `.npmrc` and per-pnpm settings; this skill does not currently harden those.

## When the User Opts Out of Corepack

If the project uses npm (not Yarn or pnpm), step 5 of the skill is a no-op. The `packageManager` field is either absent or set to `npm@X.Y.Z` (npm declarations are legal but not integrity-suffixed); either way there is nothing to integrity-pin, and there is no `.yarnrc.yml` to harden. Skip both. There is no equivalent integrity-pin mechanism in `package.json` for npm; rely on `package-lock.json` (which contains per-package integrity hashes) and `npm ci` in CI to enforce them.
