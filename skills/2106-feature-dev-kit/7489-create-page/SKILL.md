# Create Page

## When to use

Station 6. Invoke to author `pages/<slice>/` route screens. Used by `composition-engineer`. Each distinct route is one page slice. Examples: `profiles-page`, `profile-detail-page`, `document-review-page`.

## Steps

1. **Scaffold the slice** using `create-slice` for `pages/<slice>/` with segment `ui/`.

2. **Build the page component** at `pages/<slice>/ui/<page-name>/<page-name>.tsx` (kebab-case folder). If the page needs a registry primitive and `shared/ui/<name>` is missing, stop and hand it to `shared-engineer`. Do not author a second dialog.
   - Pages are thin composition — they import widgets, features, and entities via their `index.ts` and arrange them on the screen.
   - No business logic, no direct API calls, no form handling — delegate those to feature and entity slices.
   - Local layout state (e.g. selected tab from URL params) is acceptable with `useState` or `useSearchParams`.
   - Handle the full-page loading state with a viewport-filling skeleton.
   - Handle the full-page error state with a translated `Alert` and a retry `Button` (named `handleRetry`).
   - Page headings and any page-owned copy come from `pages/<slice>/locales/` or `commonKeys` — no literals (`rules/i18n.mdc`).
   - Classes live in the page folder's `styles.ts`.
   - Use the page layout conventions consistent with existing pages (read existing page files first).
   - The page does not add its own error boundary — the route wraps it in `RouteBoundary` (`add-route`). Each feature it renders brings its own boundary.
   - When a prototype page is bound, every row of `prototype-inventory.md` for this page is mapped to the widget/feature/state that renders it.

3. **Default export allowed**: the page component may use a default export (the single exception to the named-exports rule):
   ```tsx
   const ProfilesPage = (): JSX.Element => (
     <div className={styles.root}>
       <ProfilesWidget />
     </div>
   )

   export default ProfilesPage
   ```

4. **Re-export for lazy import** in `pages/<slice>/index.ts` — one line, nothing else:
   ```ts
   export { default } from './ui/profiles-page'
   ```
   The `app` layer uses this with `lazyFeature('profiles-page', () => import('@/pages/profiles-page'))`.

5. **Co-locate the page test** at `pages/<slice>/ui/<page-name>/<page-name>.test.tsx`. Mock only fetchers; assert the page shows its heading and each widget's visible content, and that the loading and error states render their copy. "Renders without crashing" is not a test.

6. **Run `yarn typecheck`**: fix all TypeScript errors.

7. **Update the spec `## Build Plan`**: mark page tasks as done, list files created.

8. **Follow up with `add-route`** to register this page in the `app` routing table.

## Pre-conditions

- All widget and feature slices the page composes exist with their `index.ts` public APIs.
- The spec's `## UI Surface` describes the page layout and states.

## Outputs

- `pages/<slice>/ui/<page-name>/<page-name>.tsx` — the route screen component (default export).
- `pages/<slice>/ui/<page-name>/<page-name>.test.tsx` — colocated behavior test.
- `pages/<slice>/index.ts` — public API (re-exports the default for lazy import).

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not register the route — use `add-route` after this skill.
- Does not add navigation entries — use `wire-navigation` after `add-route`.
- Does not contain business logic, forms, or direct API calls.
- Does not create widgets or features.
