name: feature-dev
description: Builds a complete React feature end-to-end from a request or an existing spec, following Feature-Sliced Design. Runs the full feature-dev-kit hub-and-spoke pipeline — scoped intake from spec-dev-kit plus an optional html prototype, codebase discovery, architecture-audit, bottom-up slice construction (shared → entities → features → widgets/pages → app), tests, quality gates, and auto-review — then stops at a mandatory human review gate. Never opens a pull request. Use when implementing any new feature, screen, or user interaction in a React + TypeScript codebase.

# Feature Dev

**Command**: `/feature-dev [feature-slug or request]`
**Entry point for**: the feature-dev-kit pipeline
**Pipeline driver**: `feature-orchestrator` agent (see `../../agents/feature-orchestrator.md`)
**Blackboard**: `.spec/features/<slug>.md`

This skill runs in the **main conversation**. It owns every `AskUserQuestion` call. The
orchestrator is a subagent and must never ask the user — it returns a packet and stops.

---

## Resolve KIT_DIR (do this first)

`KIT_DIR` is the **plugin root** (the directory that contains `agents/` and `skills/`). Resolve in
this order; use the first that exists:

1. Parent of this skill folder — `{this SKILL.md directory}/../..` (Claude: if
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is set, `KIT_DIR` is `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../..`).
2. `app-dev-kit/feature-dev-kit` relative to the workspace root (this marketplace repo).
3. `.spec/feature-dev-kit` (legacy consumer copy).

All script and reference paths are `{KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/…`. Never hardcode
`.spec/feature-dev-kit/skills/…`.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Check | If missing |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| Git repo on a non-protected branch | `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` | `scripts/new-feature.sh` creates the feature branch |
| FSD host app | `src/app`, `src/pages`, `src/features`, `src/entities`, `src/shared` exist | STOP — this kit does not clone a starter; open the consumer app repo |
| frontend-dev-kit installed | `frontend-dev-kit:architecture-audit` resolves, or `~/.cursor/plugins/local/frontend-dev-kit` exists | Run **Companion install** below. Do not skip the audit gate |
| shadcn registry lookup returns a component | see `references/mcp-servers.md` — call search/list before Station 0 | STOP — do not start intake, and do not hand-write primitives |
| context7 MCP responding | see `references/mcp-servers.md` | Warn; Station 1a falls back to web search |
| Working tree clean | `git status --porcelain` | Ask the human to commit or stash first |

A spec from `/generate-spec` at the `spec_path` in `.spec/app/current.json` (`.spec/spec/spec-*/spec.md`) is **optional but preferred**. When
frontend-orchestrator-kit (or the human) also passes `FEATURE_ID` / `SCREEN_REFS`, Station 0 imports
**only that feature's nested screens**. Never ingest a whole `type: app` spec into one feature run.

### Companion install

Run before Station 0 when the prerequisite check fails.

1. Installed when `frontend-dev-kit:architecture-audit` resolves, or `~/.cursor/plugins/local/frontend-dev-kit/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` exists. Then continue.
2. Host: `$CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` or a `.cursor/` directory, and `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` unset → Cursor. `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set and no Cursor signal → Claude. Both or neither → ask the user, Cursor or Claude, then do that step.
3. Cursor — symlink one plugin (not `npm run install:cursor-local`). Marketplace root is two levels above `KIT_DIR`:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.cursor/plugins/local"
ln -sfn "$(cd "$KIT_DIR/../.." && pwd)/frontend-dev-kit" "$HOME/.cursor/plugins/local/frontend-dev-kit"
```

Tell the user to reload the window. If `architecture-audit` still does not resolve, STOP.

4. Claude — this skill cannot run the slash command from bash. Ask the user to run `/plugin install frontend-dev-kit@dev-AI-plugins`, then re-check. Still missing → STOP.

---

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `[feature-slug or request]` | Optional | An existing slug in `.spec/features/` resumes that feature. Free text starts a new one. Omitted → this skill asks for the request. |

Structured fields (from frontend-orchestrator-kit or the human) may accompany the argument: `UPSTREAM_SPEC`,
`FEATURE_ID`, `TASK_IDS`, `SCREEN_REFS`, `PROTOTYPE_REF`, `CHECKLIST_PATH`, `SLUG_HINT`,
`PARENT_BRANCH`, `RESULT_OUT`. `REQUEST` may be a one-line pointer when `UPSTREAM_SPEC` + `FEATURE_ID`
are set — do not expect an inlined spec body. See `references/upstream-contract.md`.

```
/feature-dev
/feature-dev decline-profile
/feature-dev "reviewers can decline a profile with an optional reason"
```

---

## Steps

Do not read `pipeline-flow.md` into this conversation. The tier table below is the parent-loop contract. The orchestrator reads the station map once inside its own context.

### Step 1 — Resolve the feature

0. **Shadcn gate, before Station 0.** Call the session's shadcn search or list tool (`search_items_in_registries` with `query: "button"`, or the host's equivalent). Require a payload that names a real component. `npx shadcn@latest mcp --help` does not count. If the tool is missing or the call fails, STOP. Tell the human to merge `{KIT_DIR}/mcp.json` and reload. Do not start intake. Do not fall through to hand-written UI.
1. `Glob(".spec/features/*.md")`. If the argument matches an existing slug, read **frontmatter `status` only**. If `.spec/features/{slug}.context/session.md` exists, that path is the resume context — do not read the whole blackboard. Report: `"Resuming {slug} at Station {N}."`
2. Otherwise derive a slug per `references/artifact-naming.md`. **Do not** reuse the app spec's
   `metadata.slug` as the feature slug — derive from `SLUG_HINT` (the feature's kebab title),
   so `.spec/features/sign-in.md` does not collide with the app slug. `SLUG_HINT` is required
   when the checklist feature has no title to kebab. Never fall back to the app slug.
3. Resolve upstream from disk, not from chat:
   - If `UPSTREAM_SPEC` was passed, use it.
   - Else read `.spec/app/current.json`. Set `UPSTREAM_SPEC` to `spec_path` and `PROTOTYPE_REF`
     to `prototype_ref` when those fields are non-empty.
   - Then read `.spec/app/task-checklist.md`. If a **feature** matches the request
     (title, slug-hint, or a nested task `screen-ref`), adopt that feature's `FEATURE_ID`,
     `SLICE_REF` (2.0 checklists), and nested `TASK_IDS` / `SCREEN_REFS`. A `done` feature is not rebuilt unless that feature,
     or one of its tasks, is `pending` with `blocked-reason: spec changed`. If nothing matches,
     standalone feature — no whole-app dump. Do not glob `.spec/spec/spec-*/spec.md` or `.spec/app/spec-*/spec.md`.

| Spec `status` | Resume at |
|---------------|-----------|
| `draft`, `awaiting-clarification` | Station 0 |
| `approved` | Station 1 |
| `awaiting-dep-approval` | Station 1b |
| `building` | Station 2 (re-plan from the Build plan section) |
| `review`, `changes-requested` | Station 11 |
| `awaiting-human` | Station 12 |
| `done` | Report and stop — nothing to do, unless the checklist row is `pending` with `blocked-reason: spec changed`. Then import with `--changes` and resume at Station 1 |

### Step 2 — Scaffold + scoped import (Station 0)

If `PARENT_BRANCH` is set and `HEAD` is not that branch, `git checkout {PARENT_BRANCH}` first.
Do not check out `develop` / `main` / `master` between features.

```bash
bash {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/new-feature.sh {slug}
```

Capture `SLUG`, `BRANCH`, `PARENT`, and `SPEC_PATH` from stdout. `PARENT` is the branch this one
was cut from (`git checkout -b` off the current HEAD). Nested tasks do not call this script.

If `UPSTREAM_SPEC` is set, run the deterministic mapper (never paste spec body into a prompt):

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/import-upstream.mjs \
  --spec {UPSTREAM_SPEC} \
  --out {SPEC_PATH} \
  --slug {slug} \
  --feature-id {FEATURE_ID} \
  --task-ids {TASK_IDS} \
  --screen-refs {SCREEN_REFS} \
  --slice-ref {SLICE_REF or omit} \
  --story-refs {comma-separated or omit} \
  --ac-refs {comma-separated or omit} \
  --entity-refs {comma-separated or omit} \
  --prototype-ref {PROTOTYPE_REF or omit} \
  --require-scoped \
  --changes {dirname(UPSTREAM_SPEC)}/artifacts/changes.json
```

Pass `--changes` only when that file exists. `--require-scoped` is mandatory when the upstream spec `type` is `app` or has more than one
screen. Standalone requests omit it.

When the board has a `prototype-page:` line, build the parity contract (it prints `SKIP` otherwise):

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/extract-prototype-inventory.mjs --spec {SPEC_PATH}
```

It writes `.spec/features/{slug}.context/prototype-inventory.md` — every string, control, field, state, and dialog on the prototype page. Station 6 fills its React target / Status columns. See `references/upstream-contract.md` § Prototype inventory. After import, re-read frontmatter `status`. If it is `approved` and the board has `## Change request`, skip Stations 0 and 0.5 and spawn the orchestrator at Station 1. When `CHANGE=remove`, delete the existing pages and routes for those screen refs. Do not scaffold a replacement.

Then spawn `upstream-interpreter` with **paths and ids only** (it may re-run the same script).
Pass its `HANDOFF` path to `spec-analyst` together with `SPEC_PATH`. Do not paste the slice.
If `REQUEST` is more than one line of ids/paths, ignore the extra — the blackboard already has stories/ACs from import.
`spec-analyst` fills remaining gaps and returns a **CLARIFY_PACKET** — it does not ask the human
and it never sets `status: approved`.

Relay each returned question via `AskUserQuestion` (batched, max 3 rounds per
`references/pipeline-flow.md`), write the answers into `## Clarifications`, and re-spawn
`spec-analyst` to refine. Unresolved items after round 3 go to `## Decisions & Open Questions`.

### Step 3 — Spec approval gate (Station 0.5 — THIS skill owns it)

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/validate-feature-spec.mjs {SPEC_PATH}
```

When this run has `FEATURE_ID` / `TASK_IDS` / `SCREEN_REFS`, also pass `--require-scoped`.

Exit 1 means required sections are missing or acceptance criteria are untestable — route the
`ERROR [CODE]` lines back to `spec-analyst` (max 2 correction passes).

On exit 0, present the acceptance criteria and ask (single `AskUserQuestion`):
**Approve & build** · **Edit criteria** (relay free text, re-run this step) · **Abort**.

On approval set `status: approved` in the spec front matter. No subagent may do this.

### Step 4 — Choose a tier, then build

Classify from the approved blackboard only (slice count, new package, new route). Do not read the upstream app spec.

| Tier | When | What this skill does |
|------|------|----------------------|
| **patch** | One layer, at most two slices, no new dependency, no new route | Do **not** spawn `feature-orchestrator`. Spawn one `slice-engineer` (no worktree) in the background and run the Liveness parent loop below. Pass `LAYER`, `SLICE`, and one `create-*` skill. Then Station 8 (walk new executable files and spawn `test-engineer` for any without a test — same loop) and `bash {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/run-gates.sh --until conventions`. If UI changed, run the browser check below. Then Step 5. |
| **standard** | One screen, up to five slices | Spawn `feature-orchestrator` with `TIER: standard`. |
| **full** | Six or more slices, or a new route plus a new entity | Spawn `feature-orchestrator` with `TIER: full`. |

Orchestrator spawn (standard and full only):

```
MODE:        build
TIER:        standard | full
SLUG:        {slug}
SPEC_PATH:   .spec/features/{slug}.md
BRANCH:      {branch}
PARENT:      {PARENT}
KIT_DIR:     {resolved plugin root}
SESSION:     .spec/features/{slug}.context/session.md   (omit if it does not exist)

Read pipeline-flow.md once. Run the stations for this TIER.
Return one packet per references/packets.md (paths only) and STOP.
Do NOT ask the user anything. Do NOT run /create-pr, push, or merge.
Do NOT write files under src/.
Do NOT pass the upstream spec body or any worker report — spokes return a HANDOFF path.
PULSE:       .spec/features/{slug}.context/pulse.json
PULSE_SCRIPT: {resolved check-pulse.mjs, or the PULSE_SCRIPT argument}
```

Spawn that orchestrator with `run_in_background: true`, then run the parent loop. Do not block on the Agent call.

### Liveness — poll the orchestrator

Canonical procedure: `{PULSE_SCRIPT directory}/../references/agent-liveness.md` when that file exists. It wins if this section disagrees. Resolve `PULSE_SCRIPT` in order: the argument, `app-dev-kit/frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs` from the workspace root, then `{KIT_DIR}/../frontend-orchestrator-kit/skills/orchestrate-frontend/scripts/check-pulse.mjs`.

`PULSE` defaults to `.spec/features/{slug}.context/pulse.json`. If the real slug differs from a passed `slug-hint` path, touch the real path and rewrite `WATCH` (`.spec/app/watch/current.json`) with `--station 3 --feature-id` when `WATCH` was passed.

1. Record `agent_id`. Touch `--role feature-orchestrator --status working --station start`. Patch: `--role slice-engineer` (or `test-engineer`).
2. Every 60 seconds, `sleep 60` once, then `node {PULSE_SCRIPT} --check --pulse {PULSE}`. Do not end the turn while `status` is `working`.
3. Exit 0: keep waiting. Exit 2: Read `{dirname(PULSE)}/packet.json` and handle it in the packet table below. Exit 3, 4, or 5: `resume` the same id once ("Update the pulse and continue from the checkpoint"). If that does not move `updated_at` within 60 seconds, abandon it (`interrupt: true` only when it is still running) and fresh-spawn from the checkpoint path. At most two fresh spawns. Then write the envelope `--outcome error --reason stale-agent` and stop.
4. `awaiting-human` is healthy. Never resume or rebuild across it.

If the script is missing, Read the pulse JSON and apply the same rules: `working` and `updated_at` older than 3 minutes → not responding; `station` and `artifact` unchanged for 15 minutes → stalled; `awaiting-human` → healthy; no file → missing.

If this conversation is near its limit (several clarify rounds, a revise cycle, or a packet plus a long spec), write `.spec/features/{slug}.context/session.md` first (status, pending packet path, links only) and pass that path. Do not replay the prior conversation into the spawn.

Loop on `type`. Every re-spawn uses the same background parent loop.

| Packet | This skill |
|--------|------------|
| `DEP_PACKET` | Present each package; Approve / Reject — find an alternative / Abort. Record verdicts in `## Dependencies`, re-spawn `MODE: build` from Station 2. |
| `REVIEW_PACKET` | If UI changed, run the browser check below. Failures go back as `MODE: revise`, not to the human. Pass → Step 5. |
| `ESCALATION_PACKET` | `AskUserQuestion` with `errors[]` and `options[]`. Apply the choice or STOP. |

### Browser check — before Station 12

This skill owns it. The orchestrator has no browser tools. Load **frontend-dev-kit:browser-debug** and use the Chrome DevTools MCP. Run it when the increment changed UI, including a patch. Skip it only when the diff has no rendered UI.

1. If the dev server is not running, STOP and ask the human to start it. Do not skip the check.
2. Open the new route. Take a snapshot and a screenshot. Confirm the layout is the feature, not a broken or unstyled shell.
3. Exercise the main actions (click, type, submit). Read console messages. A console error or a control that does not do what the acceptance criteria say is a failure.
4. When `prototype-inventory.md` exists: run `node {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/extract-prototype-inventory.mjs --check .spec/features/<slug>.context/prototype-inventory.md` (exit 1 is a failure). Then open the prototype page (`{prototype-ref}/{prototype-page}`) beside the React route and compare **each prototype state** — use the prototype's dev-panel to switch loading / empty / error / success, and put the React page in the same state (mock the fetcher or throttle the network). Screenshot both per state. Missing copy, a different control, a missing field or column, a different button variant, a dialog that does not open, or a state the React page cannot show is a failure.
5. Open one adjacent route that shares the layout, navigation, or data this feature changed. Confirm that route still works.
6. Write `.spec/features/<slug>.context/browser-check.md` with the route, what was exercised, the per-state prototype comparison, the adjacent route, and pass or fail.

On fail, re-spawn `MODE: revise` with the browser-check path as `CHANGE_REQUEST`. Do not present Station 12.

### Step 5 — Human review gate (Station 12 — THIS skill owns it, max 3 cycles)

1. Stage the feature once. Do not commit yet, and do not commit per nested task:

   ```bash
   bash {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/commit-feature.sh {slug} --stage-only
   ```

   Read `review_path` **once** (patch runs: the slice-engineer handoff). Then show
   `git diff --cached --stat`. Say `Review locally: git diff --cached`. Do not paste the
   blackboard or the diff body into chat.
2. `AskUserQuestion` — "Review the staged feature. How should I proceed?":
   - **Approve** → set `status: done` (human-only transition), go to Step 6.
   - **Request changes** → write `session.md` (the change request and `review_path`, not the review body), then re-spawn. Patch stays on `slice-engineer` unless the change adds a dependency, a route, or a second layer. Standard and full:
     ```
     MODE:           revise
     TIER:           standard | full
     CHANGE_REQUEST: {user's text}
     SESSION:        .spec/features/{slug}.context/session.md
     SLUG / SPEC_PATH / BRANCH / KIT_DIR / PULSE / PULSE_SCRIPT: (same as build)
     ```
     The orchestrator re-enters at the lowest affected station, replays Stations 9–10 (including 9.5), and returns a fresh packet.
   - **Abort** → do not commit. Leave the index as it is. Write kit-result `aborted` and stop.
3. After 3 change cycles without approval, ask: accept-as-is, keep iterating, or abort.

### Step 6 — Result envelope, report, hand off

On approve: one commit for the feature, then the envelope. Do not push. On abort or error, skip
the commit and write the envelope only.

```bash
bash {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/commit-feature.sh {slug}
```

Write the path-only envelope **before** the human-readable report (frontend-orchestrator-kit reads the file):

```bash
node {KIT_DIR}/skills/feature-dev/scripts/write-kit-result.mjs \
  --out .spec/features/{slug}.kit-result.json \
  --kit feature-dev \
  --outcome approved \
  --spec-path .spec/features/{slug}.md \
  --feature-spec .spec/features/{slug}.md \
  --slug {slug} \
  --branch {branch} \
  --parent-branch {PARENT}
```

If `RESULT_OUT` was passed, add `--also {RESULT_OUT}`. On abort / escalation stop, same command
with `--outcome aborted` or `error` and `--reason`.

Then report **paths only**:

```
Feature built and approved — NOT shipped
Spec:    .spec/features/{slug}.md
Result:  .spec/features/{slug}.kit-result.json
Branch:  {branch}

Next step (human only):
  /create-pr
```

**This skill never opens a pull request.** `/create-pr` is `disable-model-invocation: true` and must
be typed by a human.

---

## Non-negotiables

1. **The human gates are real.** Stations 0.5, 1b, and 12 are owned by this skill, never by a subagent.
2. **No unapproved dependency.** The lockfile's package manager runs only after Station 1b sign-off.
3. **Bottom-up, gate-per-layer.** No layer is built on a red gate.
4. **The spec is the handoff medium.** Workers read and write sections; chat output is not state.
5. **One feature per run.** Nested screen-tasks share this branch and this commit. FSD slices
   inside the run are not new feature-dev calls, branches, or commits. Do not dump every app screen.
6. **Architecture-audit is a gate on standard and full.** Station 9.5 is `DIFF_SCOPE`. Station 1.5 runs on the full tier only, scoped to FSD Impact paths. Patch skips both. A missing companion plugin on a tier that requires the audit → escalate, do not skip.
7. **Automation never ships.** No agent pushes, merges, or opens a PR.

---

## Expected Duration

| Phase | Typical |
|-------|---------|
| Intake + clarification | user response time |
| **patch** (one slice, `--until conventions`, no orchestrator) | one worker plus a short gate |
| **standard** (one screen, ≤5 slices) | discovery, layer gates without build, one full sweep, diff audit, review |
| **full** (6+ slices) | standard, plus a scoped baseline audit and parallel slice workers |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| "No shadcn MCP" | Merge `{KIT_DIR}/mcp.json` into root `.mcp.json`; see `references/mcp-servers.md` |
| "architecture-audit not found" | Companion install below. Cursor: symlink then reload. Claude: `/plugin install frontend-dev-kit@dev-AI-plugins` |
| Pipeline seems stuck | Check for a pending `AskUserQuestion` — answer it to continue |
| Same gate fails 3× | Expected escalation. Read the gate log in the spec; the plan or spec is usually wrong |
| Orchestrator returned no packet | It hit a hard stop — read the spec's `Gate log` and `status` |
| Worker touched files outside its slice | The delegation was under-specified; tighten `BOUNDARY` per `templates/delegation-message.md` |
| Import dumped every app screen | Pass `FEATURE_ID` / `SCREEN_REFS` and `--require-scoped` |
| Coverage stuck below threshold | Do not weaken thresholds — find the untested branches listed in the gate output |
| Want to restart clean | Set spec `status: draft` and re-run `/feature-dev {slug}` |
