Every worker MUST update its owned section before returning — returning without writing is a
protocol violation. The orchestrator reads THIS file (not chat output) to decide the next station.

## Request

<verbatim human ask — do not paraphrase>

## Clarifications

**Q**: <question asked at Station 0>
**A**: <human's answer>

## Acceptance Criteria

1. <testable outcome — a rendered state, an API call made, a validation error shown>
2. <each must be verifiable by a test or an explicit manual check>

## FSD Impact

| Slice | Layer | Segments | Change |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| `<slice>` | `<layer>` | `api/`, `model/`, `ui/` | new \| modified |

## API Contract / Data Model

<endpoints, request/response shapes, query keys, entity types — this screen-task only>

## UI Surface

<one screen: id, title, route, states, components. prototype-page if PROTOTYPE_REF bound>

## Architecture Baseline

<Station 1.5 REPORT_ONLY findings from architecture-auditor>

## Reuse Map

| Needed | Existing source | Reuse or extend |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|

## Tech Investigation

<Station 1a findings from context7/web — only when an unfamiliar capability was hit>

## Dependencies

| Package | Version | Why | Size | License | Status |
