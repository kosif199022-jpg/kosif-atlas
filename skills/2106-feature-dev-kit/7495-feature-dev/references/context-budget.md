# Context Budget — feature-dev-kit

**Binding payload contract.** Defines exactly what each agent receives at each station. Prevents
context explosion on multi-slice features and large-diff reviews — the failure mode that turns a
working pipeline into a stalling one.

`pipeline-flow.md` gives the summary table; this file is the authority when they differ.

## The two failure modes

| Failure | Symptom | Cause |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Starvation** | Agent invents APIs, ignores conventions, re-implements existing helpers | The delegation named no rule files and no reuse map |
| **Flooding** | Agent loses focus, edits outside its slice, output degrades late in a run | Full spec, raw diffs, or another worker's file list was inlined |

Both are fixed the same way: name the exact sections and rule files, and nothing else. Aim for under
~2,000 lines of focused context per worker. Context window size is not attention budget.

## Handoff by link

Chat is a pointer. The orchestrator does not receive a worker's report, diff, gate log, or file bodies.

Directory: `.spec/features/<slug>.context/`

| File | Writer | What is inside |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `<agent>-<station>.md` | the spoke that just finished | station, outcome, paths touched, decisions, open questions, link to any longer artifact |
| `architecture-auditor-<station>.md` | `architecture-auditor` | the full architecture report. The blackboard stores this path plus one summary line |
| `orchestrator-checkpoint.md` | `feature-orchestrator` | current station, status, decisions, next action, links to spoke handoffs |
| `session.md` | `feature-dev` skill | where the human-facing run left off, which packet is pending, links only |

Chat return from any spoke, at most five lines:

```
HANDOFF: .spec/features/<slug>.context/<agent>-<station>.md
CONTAINS: <one line — files touched, gate result, open questions>
```

**Always:** do not inline. The next agent opens a handoff only when its station card names that path.

**When a spoke is near its limit** (it has read a large diff, a long spec section, or a gate transcript, or it is about to re-read something it already summarized): refresh its handoff with the main facts and keep working from that file.

**When the orchestrator is near its limit** (a layer just finished, or it has more than one spoke return and is about to spawn the next station): rewrite `orchestrator-checkpoint.md`, then spawn the next worker with only that checkpoint path, the station card, and the one handoff link that worker must read. Do not restate earlier spoke chat. Do not `Read` source files the worker just wrote.

**When the main `feature-dev` conversation is near its limit** (several clarify rounds, a revise cycle, or a returned packet plus a long spec): rewrite `session.md`. The next spawn receives `session.md` plus `SPEC_PATH`. Do not replay the prior conversation.

Packets stay small JSON. `REVIEW_PACKET.review_path` points at the review handoff. The skill reads that file once when it asks the human.

## Blackboard-first rule

The spec file at `.spec/features/<slug>.md` is the shared state for decisions. Chat history is never a handoff medium. Long artifacts live in `.spec/features/<slug>.context/`.

- Workers receive **only the section paths they need to read**, not the full spec content.
- Workers write directly to their assigned sections; the orchestrator does not proxy writes.
- The orchestrator reads the checkpoint and the sections it needs for the next station — not the entire spec every hop.
- Cross-kit: return `.spec/features/{slug}.kit-result.json` (paths + outcome) to `orchestrate-frontend`.
  Never paste the blackboard or a diff into the parent conversation.

## Per-worker input allowlist

The delegation template already lists SPEC + TARGET + APPLY + BOUNDARY + RETURN. This rule adds a required `SPEC_SECTIONS` field.

```
OBJECTIVE: <one sentence>
SPEC: .spec/features/<slug>.md
SPEC_SECTIONS:
  read:  <exact section headers the worker needs>
  write: <exact section headers the worker will update>
TARGET: <layer>/<slice>/<segment>
APPLY: skill: <one skill>
BOUNDARY: <paths>
RETURN: HANDOFF path + one CONTAINS line. No file bodies, diffs, or command output.
```

Workers open the spec sections they were named, and never scan sections outside their allowlist. They do not `Read` rule files; globs already attach them. `APPLY` names one skill.

## Layer-specific slices

| Worker | read sections | write sections |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| `upstream-interpreter` | (reads `UPSTREAM_SPEC` file, not the blackboard) | none — writes a compact slice handoff |
| `spec-analyst` | Request, Clarifications, Acceptance criteria, UI surface, API contract | those same sections; never status `approved` |
| `code-explorer` | Request, Acceptance criteria, UI surface | FSD Impact, Reuse map, UI surface (refine), Decisions |
| `research-analyst` | FSD Impact, API contract, UI surface | Tech Investigation, Dependencies |
| `shared-engineer` | Dependencies, Reuse map, Build plan (shared row) | Build plan (shared row), Gate log |
| `entities-engineer` | API contract, Data model, Reuse map, Build plan (entity rows) | Build plan (entity rows), Gate log |
| `features-engineer` | UI surface (interaction slices), Build plan (feature rows) | Build plan (feature rows), Gate log |
| `composition-engineer` | UI surface (this screen), Reuse map, Build plan (widget/page rows) | Build plan (widget/page rows), Gate log |
| `app-engineer` | UI surface (route map), Build plan (app row) | Build plan (app row), Gate log |
| `slice-engineer` | The sections for its LAYER + SLICE only | Build plan (its row), Gate log |
| `test-engineer` | Acceptance criteria, Build plan | Build plan (test rows), Gate log |
| `quality-gate-runner` | Gate log | Gate log |
| `architecture-auditor` | FSD Impact paths (full-tier baseline) or changed-file list (diff) | **none on the blackboard** — writes the report to its handoff file |
| `feature-orchestrator` | Build plan, Gate log, status, Human Review, checkpoint | `.spec/features/<slug>.md` and `.spec/features/<slug>.context/` (never `src/`) |

Anything outside the listed sections is off-limits without an explicit orchestrator note extending the allowlist.

## code-reviewer input contract

The `code-reviewer` must NOT receive the raw output of `git diff main...HEAD`. Instead:

1. Orchestrator runs `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` and passes the file list.
2. `code-reviewer` iterates the file list, reading each file's diff on demand via `git diff main...HEAD -- <path>`.

Never load the entire diff into the reviewer's prompt. If the file list is large, the 100 KB
diff-size guard still applies per path; do not invent a second triage agent.

## test-engineer invocation model

- One `test-engineer` invocation per **layer group** (shared, entities, features, composition, app), not one per slice — otherwise per-slice invocations pay the setup cost N times.
- Each invocation receives:
  - `LAYER_GROUP`: one of `shared` / `entities` / `features` / `composition` / `app`
  - `SLICE_PATHS`: [ `src/{layer}/{slice}`, ... ]
  - `COVERAGE_TARGETS`: from `quality-gates.md`
- The invocation writes coverage results per slice into the spec's Gate log before returning.

## Slice workers

Each worker receives only its own slice's `SPEC_SECTIONS`. Do not inline every slice's sections into one worker.

## Prototype inventory

`.spec/features/<slug>.context/prototype-inventory.md` is passed by **path** to UI workers and to
`code-reviewer`. Never paste its rows into a prompt or onto the blackboard. Workers read the rows
for their page/state and edit only the React target / Status cells. The prototype HTML itself is
read only by `composition-engineer` (and the browser check), never by the orchestrator.

## Size guards

| Payload | Soft limit | Action on breach |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Any single worker's spec slice | 12 KB | Split the section; escalate to orchestrator to re-scope |
| Diff passed to reviewer | 100 KB | Split the file list; reviewer reads remaining paths on demand |
| `git status` output attached | never | Reviewer runs git commands itself; orchestrator does not inline output |

## Anti-patterns

| ❌ Never | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Read the entire spec in every station | The spec grows with each station; re-reading amplifies cost |
| Pass raw `git diff` output to `code-reviewer` | Reviewer's prompt grows linearly with feature size |
| Pass all slice paths to every worker | Parallel workers should not know about each other's files |
| Batch multiple stations' outputs into one prompt | Every station's payload is single-purpose |
| Return command output or file contents to the orchestrator | Return `HANDOFF` + `CONTAINS`; the next agent opens the file only if named |
| Say "follow the project conventions" instead of naming rule files | An unnamed rule loads nothing — that is starvation |
| Inline the same reference into every parallel worker | Pass the path; each worker loads it in its own window |

## When context conflicts

If the spec contradicts the codebase — the spec says REST, the entity slice uses GraphQL — do not
silently pick one. Write the conflict to `## Decisions & Open Questions`, state both options and
your recommendation, and return to the orchestrator. Inventing a resolution is how a feature ends up
half-built against each answer.

Likewise, when the spec does not cover a case the implementation needs: check the codebase for
precedent first; if none exists, escalate rather than inventing a requirement.
