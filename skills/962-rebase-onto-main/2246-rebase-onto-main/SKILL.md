# Rebase Onto Main

Fetch and rebase the current feature branch onto the repository's base branch.

## Options

The user may provide these options inline:

- **--base `<branch>`**: Override the auto-detected base branch (e.g., `--base develop`)

## Skill dependencies

- **Required:** None
- **Optional:** `commit`

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks

Run these commands in parallel to understand the current state:

```bash
# Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# Detect the repository's default branch
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q '.defaultBranchRef.name'

# Confirm which branch we are on
git branch --show-current

# Check whether the branch has been pushed to a remote
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' 2>/dev/null || echo "no upstream"
```

If `--base <branch>` was specified, use that value instead of the detected default branch.

**If `gh` is not available**, fall back to detecting the default branch with:

```bash
git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | sed 's/.*: //'
```

**If the current branch is the default branch itself**, warn the user that rebasing the base branch onto itself is a no-op and stop.

### 2. Handle Uncommitted Changes

If `git status` shows uncommitted changes (staged or unstaged):

1. Warn the user that there are uncommitted changes.
1. Ask whether to:
   - **Stash**: Run `git stash` before proceeding, then `git stash pop` after the rebase completes.
   - **Commit first**: Invoke the `/commit` skill, then continue with the rebase. `commit` is an optional dependency: if it is not installed, leave this choice out and tell the user why, so they can commit by hand, or install `commit`, before running this skill again.
   - **Abort**: Stop without doing anything.

Rebase will refuse to start with a dirty working tree, so this step is mandatory before fetching.

### 3. Fetch and Rebase

Capture the current HEAD so the post-rebase step can detect whether history was actually rewritten:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Record this as `<pre-rebase-head>`. Then:

```bash
git fetch origin <default-branch>
git rebase origin/<default-branch>
```

Where `<default-branch>` is the detected or overridden base branch name.

### 4. Handle Rebase Result

#### Clean Rebase

If the rebase completes without conflicts:

1. Report success.
1. Show a summary of the replayed commits:

```bash
git log origin/<default-branch>..HEAD --oneline
```

This range lists exactly the commits that now sit on top of the rebased base, regardless of whether the branch has an upstream. Avoid `@{u}..HEAD` here: it fails when the branch has no upstream, and after a rebase it can also include base-branch commits the rebase moved onto, not just the replayed feature commits.

#### Already Up to Date

If git reports "Current branch <branch> is up to date." or "Fast-forwarded ...", report the result and continue to the post-rebase steps. In this case the local HEAD is unchanged (or only fast-forwarded), so the push step uses a normal `git push` rather than `--force-with-lease`.

#### Conflicts

If the rebase produces conflicts, proceed to the conflict resolution workflow below.

### 5. Conflict Resolution

Rebase resolves conflicts **per commit**, not as a single merge. For each conflicting commit, git pauses the rebase, marks the conflicting files, and waits for resolution before continuing.

For each pause:

1. **Identify the conflicting commit**:

```bash
git status
```

The status output names the commit currently being applied (e.g., "You are currently rebasing branch '...' on '<sha>'."). Read it and look at the commit being replayed:

```bash
git log -1 --oneline REBASE_HEAD
```

1. **List conflicted files**:

```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

1. **Resolve each conflicted file**:
   - Read the file and examine the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
   - Use the surrounding code context, the intent of both sides, and the project's conventions to determine the correct resolution.
   - For trivial conflicts (whitespace, import ordering, adjacent non-overlapping changes), resolve automatically.
   - For non-trivial conflicts where the correct resolution is ambiguous, show the user both sides and ask which to keep or how to combine them.

1. **Stage resolved files**:

```bash
git add <resolved-file>
```

1. **Continue the rebase**:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

This re-applies the commit with the resolved content. Git will reuse the original commit message; if the commit becomes empty after resolution, it prompts to skip with `git rebase --skip`.

1. **Repeat** until git reports the rebase complete. Each subsequent commit may produce its own conflicts.

If at any point the situation becomes unrecoverable, abort cleanly:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

This restores the branch to its pre-rebase state.

### 6. Post-Rebase Steps

After a successful rebase (with or without conflict resolution):

1. **Lockfile changes**: If any lockfiles changed during the rebase (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `go.sum`, `Gemfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `composer.lock`), suggest running the appropriate install command:
   - `package-lock.json` -> `npm install`
   - `yarn.lock` -> `yarn install`
   - `pnpm-lock.yaml` -> `pnpm install`
   - `go.sum` -> `go mod tidy`
   - `Gemfile.lock` -> `bundle install`
   - `poetry.lock` -> `poetry install`
   - `Cargo.lock` -> `cargo build`
   - `composer.lock` -> `composer install`

1. **Push**:

   First decide whether a force push is actually required. A change in HEAD alone is not enough to conclude that history was rewritten: when the local branch had no commits beyond the base, `git rebase` simply fast-forwards HEAD onto the new tip without rewriting anything. Distinguish the two cases by checking whether `<pre-rebase-head>` from step 3 is still reachable from the post-rebase HEAD:

   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   git merge-base --is-ancestor <pre-rebase-head> HEAD
   ```

   If `git merge-base --is-ancestor` exits 0, the pre-rebase commit is an ancestor of the new HEAD, so the rebase was a no-op or a fast-forward and no force push is needed. If it exits non-zero, the original commits are no longer on the branch's history line, so the rebase rewrote history and any already-published copy of the branch must be replaced with a force push.

   Choose the push command based on three cases:
   - **No upstream** (fresh branch never pushed): no force needed.

     ```bash
     git push -u origin HEAD
     ```

   - **Upstream exists, no-op or fast-forward only** (`<pre-rebase-head>` is an ancestor of the post-rebase HEAD): history was not rewritten. Skip the push entirely if HEAD is unchanged, or run a plain `git push` if there are local commits ahead of upstream that haven't been pushed yet.

     ```bash
     git push
     ```

   - **Upstream exists, history rewritten by rebase** (`<pre-rebase-head>` is no longer an ancestor of the post-rebase HEAD): force-with-lease is required to replace the previously pushed history.

     ```bash
     git push --force-with-lease
     ```

   **Always use `--force-with-lease`, never plain `--force`.** `--force-with-lease` refuses to overwrite the remote if someone else has pushed in the meantime; plain `--force` clobbers their work without checking.

   The user's CLAUDE.md forbids using force flags as a workaround without explicit instruction. Force-pushing after a rebase that rewrote history is the documented exception: it is required by the rebase workflow itself, not a workaround for an unexpected failure. Still prefer `--force-with-lease` over `--force` and surface the command before running it.

   **Never** run `git push --force` (without `--force-with-lease`) and **never** force-push the default branch.

### 7. Stash Recovery

If changes were stashed in step 2, pop the stash after the rebase completes:

```bash
git stash pop
```

If the stash pop produces conflicts, warn the user and list the conflicted files.

## Error Handling

- **On the default branch**: Warn that rebasing the base branch onto itself is a no-op and stop.
- **No remote configured**: Report the error and stop.
- **Dirty working tree**: Rebase refuses to start. Step 2 must resolve this before fetching.
- **Rebase aborted by user**: Clean up with `git rebase --abort`, which restores the pre-rebase state.
- **Empty commit during rebase** (the commit's changes are already present in the base): Use `git rebase --skip` to drop it, after confirming with the user.
- **Fetch failure** (network issues, authentication): Report the error clearly and stop.
- **`--force-with-lease` rejection** (someone else pushed to the remote branch since you last fetched): Do **not** escalate to `--force`. Stop, report the divergence, and ask the user how to proceed (typically: fetch, inspect the upstream changes, decide whether to integrate them).
- **Stash pop conflicts**: Warn the user and list conflicted files so they can resolve manually.
