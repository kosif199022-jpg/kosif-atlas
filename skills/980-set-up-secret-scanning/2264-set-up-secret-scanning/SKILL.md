# Set-Up Secret Scanning

Set up secret scanning in a repository with [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) and [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) GitHub Actions workflows and optional `.gitleaks.toml` configuration.

The two tools are complementary:

- **Gitleaks** performs fast pattern matching.
- **TruffleHog** performs deeper verification-based scanning that confirms whether detected credentials are still live.

Both run on pushes to `main`, on every pull request, and on manual `workflow_dispatch`.

## Workflow

### 1. Check for Existing Setup

Look for existing secret scanning workflows and configuration:

```bash
ls .github/workflows/gitleaks.yml
ls .github/workflows/gitleaks.yaml
ls .github/workflows/trufflehog.yml
ls .github/workflows/trufflehog.yaml
```

Also check for an existing `.gitleaks.toml`:

```bash
ls .gitleaks.toml
```

If any workflows already exist, inform the user and ask whether to overwrite each one or skip it.

### 2. Choose Scanning Tools

If the user specified a tool selection in their request (`gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, or `both`), use it directly instead of asking.

Ask the user which tools to set up:

- **Both gitleaks and TruffleHog** (recommended): complementary coverage with fast pattern matching and deep verification
- **Gitleaks only**: fast pattern matching on every push and PR
- **TruffleHog only**: verification-based scanning on pushes to main

### 3. Generate Gitleaks Workflow

If gitleaks was selected, read `./references/gitleaks-workflow.md` for the workflow template and create `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml` from it.

Write the file using the Write tool. The `.github/workflows/` directory will be created automatically if it does not exist.

### 4. Generate TruffleHog Workflow

If TruffleHog was selected, read `./references/trufflehog-workflow.md` for the workflow template and create `.github/workflows/trufflehog.yml` from it.

Write the file using the Write tool.

### 5. Optionally Generate Gitleaks Configuration

If gitleaks was selected, ask the user whether they want a `.gitleaks.toml` configuration file.

If yes, read `./references/gitleaks-config.md` for the configuration template and create `.gitleaks.toml` in the repository root from it. Adapt the allowlist paths to the project:

- **Go projects** (have `go.mod`): include `go.sum`
- **JavaScript projects** (have `package.json`): include `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- **Ruby projects** (have `Gemfile`): include `Gemfile.lock`
- Remove lockfile entries that do not apply to the project.

If no, skip this step.

### 6. Summary

Print a summary of what was created:

- List every file generated
- Note that both workflows run on pushes to `main`, pull requests, and `workflow_dispatch`
- Mention that gitleaks will automatically comment on PRs when secrets are detected

## Error Handling

- If any workflow file already exists, ask before overwriting
- If `.github/workflows/` cannot be created, check that the current directory is a git repository root

## Reference Templates

- `./references/gitleaks-workflow.md` -- gitleaks GitHub Actions workflow
- `./references/trufflehog-workflow.md` -- TruffleHog GitHub Actions workflow
- `./references/gitleaks-config.md` -- `.gitleaks.toml` configuration

## Refresh `cboone/gh-actions` SHAs before scaffolding

The `cboone/gh-actions` reusable-workflow refs in this skill's templates are SHA-pinned with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment that was current when the template was authored. New releases of `cboone/gh-actions` rot those SHAs. Before emitting a workflow into a user's repo, refresh both the SHA and the comment to current latest:

```bash
TAG="$(gh release view --repo cboone/gh-actions --json tagName --jq '.tagName')"
SHA="$(gh api "repos/cboone/gh-actions/commits/${TAG}" --jq '.sha')"
echo "${SHA} # ${TAG}"
```

Replace each `cboone/gh-actions/.../<workflow>.yml@<old-sha> # <old-tag>` in the emitted workflow with the new SHA and tag. Dependabot in the user's repo keeps them in sync afterwards.
