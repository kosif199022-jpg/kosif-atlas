# Remediation Workflow

Mechanics for bonifying an already-degraded suite. The ladder is: measure, quarantine, consolidate, verify. Never "grand refactor of the suite": that loses the real coverage buried in the mess and blocks development for weeks. Remediation runs opportunistically, per module, alongside normal work.

## 1. Measure first: the TEST_AUDIT.md contract

`/testing:test-audit` maintains a `TEST_AUDIT.md` at the audited root. Format:

- Each run PREPENDS a `## Audit <ISO date>` section, newest first, so the file reads as its own history in addition to git's.
- The section carries a metrics table with a delta column against the previous audit section when one exists:

| Metric | Value | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| Test files | | |
| Test cases | | |
| Total runtime | | |
| Skipped/disabled | | |
| Failing | | |
| Flaky (rerun disagreement) | | |
| Orphan test files | | |
| Layer distribution (unit/integration/e2e) | | |
| Top-10 slowest (list) | | |
| Per-module coverage (when tooling exists) | | |

- Below the table: the audit findings summary from the test-suite-auditor (by severity, with file:line evidence) and the recommended remediation order.
- The file is versioned in git and committed with the audit. It is the map and the progress ledger of the bonification.

## 2. Quarantine protocol

Quarantine is the move that makes everything else possible: it turns the suite green and trustworthy in a day without deleting anything. From that moment a CI failure is a signal again, not background noise.

**Layout.** `tests/_quarantine/` mirrors the original relative paths: `tests/unit/auth/test_login.py` moves to `tests/_quarantine/unit/auth/test_login.py`. No renames, so provenance stays greppable.

**Ledger.** `tests/_quarantine/README.md` holds one row per quarantined file:

| Original path | Date | Category | Reason | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Categories: `orphan` (source deleted), `failing` (red on current main), `flaky` (rerun disagreement), `skipped` (skip marker older than 30 days). Evidence is a command output line or CI link, not an opinion.

**CI exclusion**, once, in the runner config:

| Runner | Exclusion |
|---|---|
| pytest | `norecursedirs = tests/_quarantine` (or `--ignore=tests/_quarantine`) |
| Vitest | `exclude: ['tests/_quarantine/**']` |
| Jest | `testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/tests/_quarantine/']` |
| Go | Quarantine dir outside the module's package tree, or a `//go:build quarantine` tag |
| Cargo | Move out of `tests/`; ignored files in `src` are not collected |
| JUnit | Exclude the quarantine source set in the build file |

**Lifecycle.** Two rules, both firm:

1. An entry is processed (rewritten into the consolidated file or deleted) only when its module is next touched. Nobody "works through the quarantine" as a standalone project.
2. Age is an investigation signal, not a verdict. An entry older than 3 months becomes a deletion CANDIDATE: propose the drop through the consolidation approval gate with corroborating evidence beyond age (the feature was removed, replacement coverage exists, the test was born as a temporary migration aid, no bug-fix provenance in `git log`). A quarantined test can guard a process that runs once a year; age alone never justifies the deletion.

## 3. Per-module consolidation

Executed by `/testing:test-consolidate <module>`. The order of operations is the whole point; skipping the inventory is how consolidations silently lose the six edge cases that were the only reason the ugly tests existed.

1. **Collect** every test touching the module, wherever it lives, including quarantine entries.
2. **Inventory behaviors, not tests.** Produce the table before writing any code:

   | Behavior | file:line | Duplicate of | Value | Reason |
   |---|---|---|---|---|

   Value is `high`, `low`, or `none`. Flag separately: tests contradicting each other, tests asserting implementation details, tests that cannot fail (no asserts, tautologies, everything mocked).
3. **Approve.** The keep-list and delete-list are explicit and user-approved. Unanswered rows default to keep.
4. **Rewrite** one file per owner at the correct layer (one test file per source file for unit tests, one file per behavioral scope for integration, contract, and e2e), covering the approved behaviors plus evident gaps, following the prevention rules.
5. **Delete the originals in the same commit** as the rewrite, including processed quarantine entries and their ledger rows.
6. **Verify**: the module's coverage must not drop below the pre-consolidation baseline. Tests that cannot execute locally are gated on the CI run after the push. On a failed gate, roll the commit back (`git reset --hard HEAD~1` while it exists only locally, `git revert` once it has been pushed) and report which behaviors lost coverage. Where no coverage tooling exists, the gate degrades to "count of distinct behaviors covered must not drop", stated explicitly.

## 4. Safety net before mass pruning

When confidence in the real coverage is low, add 5-15 e2e tests over the critical business flows BEFORE any large deletion. They are the guarantee that pruning breaks nothing visible, and they unblock deletion decisions psychologically. Write them per the `developer-essentials:e2e-testing-patterns` skill (a hard dependency of this plugin; install it from the wshobson/agents marketplace if missing).

## 5. Mutation testing (guidance only)

Mutation testing is the only tool that objectively identifies tests that test nothing: it mutates the code and reports which tests still pass. Configuration guidance, not a shipped runner:

| Stack | Tool |
|---|---|
| JS/TS | Stryker |
| Python | mutmut |
| JVM | PIT |
| Rust | cargo-mutants |
| .NET | Stryker.NET |

Run it as a weekly CI job, never per-commit (CI time cost). Feed surviving mutants into the next audit's D8 dimension (never-failing tests) so pruning decisions rest on data. On a still-dirty suite, mutation results are too noisy to act on; run the quarantine phase first.
