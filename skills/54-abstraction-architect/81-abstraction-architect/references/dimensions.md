# Dimensions and Lenses

A **dimension** is a category a finding can belong to. Each one has its own proof rule. A **lens** is a criterion applied to every candidate of every dimension, reported as a field of the finding. A lens never becomes a category of its own.

Load `references/evidence-tracks.md` for the gates cited below.

## The seven dimensions

| | Dimension | Track | Proof rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Duplicated domain knowledge | B | same policy, formula or invariant; two or more representations; they must stay consistent |
| D2 | Competing sources of truth | B | same fact; two or more authoritative writers or definitions; canonical owner absent or ambiguous |
| D3 | Redundant representation | B | same concept; parallel representations; real mapping or synchronization cost |
| D4 | Duplicated or derivable state | B | derivable but maintained separately, plus sync, invalidation or repair code |
| D5 | Missed unification | A | mechanism independently repeated three or more times; Rule of Three |
| D6 | Prior art available | A | a clearly canonical implementation exists and something else reimplements or bypasses it |
| D7 | Abstraction fitness | A | proven internal friction: flags, per-caller exceptions, caller bypass, leakage |

### D1. Duplicated domain knowledge

The same rule expressed more than once, usually without textual similarity.

```
OrderService:        if total > 1000 -> requiresApproval
CheckoutController:  if cartValue > 1000 -> managerApproval
InvoiceWorkflow:     highValue = amount > 1000
```

**Proof:** same concept, plus same decision, invariant or formula, plus different implementation sites. A grep finds candidates. The finding exists only after reading each context and demonstrating that they encode the same policy. Gates K1 to K6 apply.

### D2. Competing sources of truth

The same fact has more than one authority. This is more serious than duplication, and the question is not "are these similar" but "which one actually decides".

```
config/defaults.py     -> refund_days = 30
database.settings         refund_window
RefundPolicy.DEFAULT_DAYS = 30
```

**Proof:** same fact, plus two or more independent authoritative writers or definitions, plus no single canonical owner. Two is sufficient.

### D3. Redundant representation

The same concept modelled in parallel, with a real cost to keep the models aligned.

```
UserStatus enum   <->   AccountState enum   <->   CRMStatus mapping
```

Four types named after one concept are **not** automatically a finding. `CustomerDTO`, `CustomerEntity`, `CustomerResponse` and `CustomerEvent` may have entirely different boundaries and lifecycles, and usually do.

**Proof:** same fields, plus same semantics, plus same lifecycle, plus a continuous one-to-one mapping, plus no boundary-specific reason, plus changes that routinely propagate across all of them. Anything less is a legitimate boundary and reporting it is a false positive.

### D4. Duplicated or derivable state

Information that could be derived is instead stored, and the codebase carries the burden of keeping the copies aligned.

`cart.items` and `cart.total` is not by itself a defect. Materializing a total is often correct.

**Proof:** derivable, plus persisted separately, plus **evidence of the synchronization burden**:

```
recalculate_total()   update_total()   sync_total()   repair_cart_total()
```

plus more than one writer. The presence of repair code is the strongest signal, because repair code exists only where drift has already happened. A field being derivable is not evidence on its own.

### D5. Missed unification

A mechanism recurs and the codebase is asking for an abstraction that does not exist yet.

**Proof:** three or more independent occurrences encoding the same concern, gate A3 in its Rule of Three form. Consult `references/unification-patterns.md` for canonical shapes, remembering that the catalog is not an admission gate.

### D6. Prior art available

The abstraction already exists and part of the codebase does not use it.

```
CanonicalMoneyParser.parse()        exists, is clearly the owner
parse_money_again(...)              reimplements it elsewhere
```

**Proof:** one canonical implementation plus at least one reimplementation or bypass. No third occurrence is required, and demanding one is the misreading gate A3 exists to prevent. The strong evidence is not frequency, it is that an owner already exists.

D5 and D6 are adjacent and distinct, and the distinction changes the remediation:

```
D5 = the codebase is asking for an abstraction.        Remediation: design or consolidate.
D6 = the abstraction exists and is being bypassed.     Remediation: reuse, migrate to canonical.
```

### D7. Abstraction fitness

An existing layer is fighting its callers.

**Proof:** friction inside one abstraction. Flags accumulating on the signature, per-caller exceptions, callers bypassing it, vendor or implementation detail leaking through the public surface, parallel concrete implementations that route around it. No count of copies is involved. Consult `references/anti-patterns.md`.

**Boundary with `senior-review:code-auditor`.** A god function or a one-implementation interface that is fully visible inside the file under review belongs to that agent's Abstraction Inspector. D7 is the cross-file case: friction proven by external callers bypassing the layer, or by exceptions added for callers that live elsewhere. Do not re-flag what one file shows on its own.

## The four lenses

A lens is applied to every candidate and reported as a field. It never opens a finding by itself.

**L1 Change amplification.** If this concept changes, how many places must change together? This is the primary yardstick, and `references/theory.md` develops it as the single rule of thumb. Reported as the count and the list.

**L2 Indirection cost, Locality of Behaviour.** Would consolidating actually reduce cognitive cost, or only add another hop? This lens exists to stop the plugin proposing false remedies. A suggested direction that fails L2 is reported as a finding with an explicit note that the obvious unification is not the answer.

**L3 Bounded context.** A hard gate on track B, per gate K6. An important lens on track A but not an absolute gate, because two contextually separate call sites may still legitimately share an infrastructural mechanism.

**L4 Option price, Tidy First.** Does the benefit justify the abstraction today, or is deliberate duplication cheaper right now? This lens is what keeps the audit from being refactor-happy. A finding whose L4 verdict is "duplication is currently cheaper" is still reported, with that verdict stated, because the user may be waiting for a third occurrence deliberately.

## Occurrences are evidence, never severity

There is no mapping of the form two equals Low, three equals Medium, four equals High. Two independent authoritative permission policies can be High on two occurrences. Four duplicated formatting constants can be Low on four.

Severity follows consequence, calibrated in `references/decision-frame.md`. Occurrence count is reported as evidence strength and nothing else.

## Single primary classification

One defect gets one primary dimension.

A refund window duplicated in three places, one of which looks canonical, could be read simultaneously as D1, D2, D5 and D6. Four findings for one defect is a report bug, and it is the failure mode that makes conventional DRY tooling tiring to read.

Orienting precedence, applied as a principle and not as a rigid universal ordering:

```
D2 competing authority
  D4 duplicated state
    D3 redundant representation
      D1 duplicated knowledge
        D6 existing prior art
          D5 missed unification
            D7 abstraction fitness
```

The rule: **report the deepest architectural reason**, and record the others as supporting evidence or lens values rather than duplicate findings.

Worked example. Three implementations of a refund policy exist because three modules each consider themselves authoritative.

- Classified as D5, the finding says "we could extract a helper". True and shallow.
- Classified as D2, the finding says "nobody owns this policy". True and actionable.

D2 is deeper on the precedence, so D2 is the finding and the D5 observation becomes a line of supporting evidence. Extracting a helper without settling ownership would produce a fourth authority.

## The catalogs are not admission gates

The original defect this plugin was rebuilt to fix was not that its twelve unification patterns were infrastructural. It was that a catalog consulted as a matching step silently became the boundary of what could be found. Adding domain patterns fixes the coverage and reproduces the mechanism at a larger size unless the mechanism itself is addressed.

A candidate that passes its dimension's gate is a finding whether or not it matches a catalogued pattern. When it matches, cite the pattern. When it does not, name the concern in your own words and set the finding's `Pattern` field to `uncatalogued`.
