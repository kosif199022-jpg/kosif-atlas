# Story Initialization

## Overview

Initialize a new story project with a structured markdown folder layout. Creates the story bible, registries, scene tracking, continuity state, glossary, worldbuilding folders, plot structure, and chapter tracker - all as cross-referenced markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

## When to Use

- Starting a new story, book, or fiction project
- Setting up the folder structure for an existing story idea
- NOT for adding to an existing story project (use the domain-specific skills instead)
- NOT for a sequel, prequel, or companion to an existing book: use `series-continuity`, which links the projects and carries canon across
- NOT for finding the idea itself: when the user has only a vague notion ("something about lighthouses"), several competing ideas, or no premise yet, run the `premise-workshop` skill first, then return here with the chosen premise, form, and genre
- NOT for converting an existing manuscript or chapter drafts: run `story import <source> --title '{Title}'` instead, then build out the bible from the entity candidates it prints. Import does not accept `--form`, so afterwards set `form` and `target-words` in `story.md` by hand (see the form list and defaults below); without them `story validate` never checks length and `story progress` has no target

## Workflow

1. Ask for basic story information (if a `premise-workshop` session produced a premise, logline, genre, and form, reuse them rather than asking again):
   - Title
   - Form: `novel`, `novella`, `novelette`, `short-story`, `flash`, `serial`, `picture-book`, or `chapter-book`. Without `--form`, `story init` writes no `form` and no `target-words`, so if the user doesn't choose, pass `--form novel`
   - Genre and sub-genre
   - Brief synopsis (2-3 sentences)
   - Setting era/time period
   - Key themes (2-4)
   - POV style (first-person, third-person-limited, third-person-omniscient)
   - Tense (past, present, future, mixed)
   - Language the book is written in, as a BCP 47 tag: `en`, `en-GB`, `fr`, `es-MX`, `pt-BR`, `de`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`. Add a region only when it matters (spelling, punctuation, or market). If the user writes to you in a language other than English, confirm rather than assume. Default `en`

If the Story CLI is available, prefer using it to create the starter project, then inspect and refine the generated files as needed:

```shell
story init '{Title}' --form '{form}' --genre '{genre}' --sub-genre '{sub-genre}' --setting-era '{era}' --pov '{pov-style}' --tense '{tense}' --synopsis '{synopsis}' --theme '{theme-1}' --theme '{theme-2}'
```

The values are the user's own words, so quote each one for the shell: wrap it in single quotes and write any single quote inside it as `'\''`. Never paste a value into double quotes, where `$(...)`, backticks, and `"` still take effect.

`--form` records `form` in `story.md` and, when no target is given, sets a default `target-words` for the form (novel 80,000, novella 30,000, novelette 12,000, short story 5,000, flash 1,000, chapter book 10,000, picture book 500; serials get no book-level default). `story validate` then warns when `target-words` is outside the form's usual range. For short forms, point the user to `references/short-story-form.md` in the `plot-structure` skill.

Record the language straight after init. `story init` has no flag for it, so add `language: {tag}` to the `story.md` frontmatter by hand, with the exact tag the user gave, regional variants such as `en-GB` or `en-AU` included. Write it for English books too: it costs nothing, and a missing field only means `en`. The language is not just metadata: drafting, editing, and critique skills write and judge prose in it, `story validate` checks the tag, and builds declare it. For a book not in English, set `dialect: unspecified` in `style-sheet.md` (the British and American spelling pairs are English) and, before the first chapter, settle the dialogue punctuation with the `voice-style` skill.

A Chinese (`zh`) or Japanese (`ja`) book is counted in characters, not words: `story wordcount`, `story progress`, the registries, and the form check all measure characters, against `target-characters`. Because the language is added after init, `--form` will have written a `target-words`; replace it with `target-characters` for the form (Chinese: novel 200,000, novella 60,000, short story 10,000, flash 1,500; Japanese: novel 150,000, novella 80,000, short story 20,000, flash 4,000), or a number the user names. No source sets a novelette, picture-book, or chapter-book length in characters, so those forms get no default and no range check: ask the user for a target. `story validate` warns `unused-target` until you do. Only set `count-unit: words` or `count-unit: characters` when the user asks to count the other way. Then run `story wordcount . --write` and `story validate .`.

The other publishing metadata (`isbn`, `publisher`, `publication-date`, `description`, `keywords`, `subjects`, `copyright`, `cover-alt`, `ai-disclosure`) is optional and can wait until the book is ready to publish; the `publishing` skill fills it in. Do not ask for it at init.

The story id recorded in every registry is the kebab-case form of the title (`--dir` sets only the directory). A title with no ASCII letters or digits takes its story id from the folder name: a Cyrillic or Greek title is transliterated for the default folder (`Война и мир` goes in `voyna-i-mir`), and a title in a script with no transliteration table, such as Chinese, needs `--dir` with an ASCII folder name. The id is recomputed from the title on every run, so it changes whenever the title does: after editing `title` in `story.md`, run `story reindex .` to rewrite the id in every registry, `plot/timeline.md`, and `continuity/state.md`, or `story validate` fails with `story must be <new-id>`. For a folder-name id, a new title that gains any ASCII letter or digit (`Война и мир — том 2`) takes over the id (`2`), so prefer titles without them or reindex afterwards. `init` refuses an existing directory unless you pass `--force`; with `--force` it only creates missing starter files and never overwrites an existing `story.md`, registry, timeline, or `continuity/state.md`.

`init` also writes a `.gitignore` listing `dist/` (build output), `.story.lock`, leftover `.*.story-*.tmp` and `.story-*.tmp` files, and OS and editor swap files, but only when the project has none. It never edits an existing `.gitignore`; if it prints `note: .gitignore was kept and does not ignore dist/`, tell the user and offer to add a `dist/` line (or remove a `!dist/...` negation).

If `story` is not installed, use `bun run story --` from the Story Skills repository checkout or the bundled fallback `node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js` with the same arguments, resolving the path relative to this skill folder:

```shell
node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js init "{Title}"
```

If neither command is available, create the files manually using the steps below.

2. Create the folder structure at the current working directory:

```
{story-title-kebab}/
├── .gitignore
├── story.md
├── style-sheet.md
├── characters/
│   └── _index.md
├── worldbuilding/
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── locations/
│   ├── systems/
│   ├── factions/
│   └── artifacts/
├── plot/
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── arcs/
│   └── timeline.md
├── scenes/
│   └── _index.md
├── continuity/
│   ├── state.md
│   ├── questions/
│   │   └── _index.md
│   ├── promises/
│   │   └── _index.md
│   └── clues/
│       └── _index.md
├── glossary/
│   ├── _index.md
│   └── terms/
└── chapters/
    └── _index.md
```

Write `.gitignore` only if the folder has none, with `dist/`, `.story.lock`, `.*.story-*.tmp`, `.story-*.tmp`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, and `*~`, one per line.

3. Populate `story.md` with the story bible:

```yaml
---
title: "{Title}"
schema-version: 2
genre: {genre}
sub-genre: {sub-genre}
setting-era: {era}
status: planning
form: {form}
themes:
  - {theme-1}
  - {theme-2}
premise: "{One-sentence controlling idea: value + cause, e.g. justice triumphs because the hero outsmarts the system}"
counter-premise: "{The antagonist's embodied argument}"
pov: {pov-style}
tense: {tense}
language: {language-tag}
---
```

Below the frontmatter, include sections:
- **Synopsis** - the 2-3 sentence synopsis provided
- **Tone & Style** - brief notes on the story's voice (derive from genre/themes)
- **Notes** - empty section for the user to fill in

4. Draft a working premise:

Fill in the `premise:` and `counter-premise:` fields as hypotheses, not commitments. The premise is a one-sentence controlling idea — value + cause, e.g. "justice triumphs because the hero outsmarts the system". The counter-premise is the antagonist's embodied argument: the story's opposing value, stated as the antagonist would believe it. Draft both early, alongside the synopsis, but do not force theme — a working premise is a guess to be audited, not a conclusion to be imposed. Revisit it during revision: the `revision-continuity` theme audit pass (see the `theme-craft` skill for the deep pass) checks whether the ending actually dramatizes the premise through consequence. If the draft argues a different premise, update the premise, not the draft.

5. Populate each `_index.md` with an empty registry:

**`characters/_index.md`:**
```markdown
---
type: character-registry
story: {story-title-kebab}
---

# Characters

## Registry

| Name | Role | Status | File |
|------|------|--------|------|
| *No characters yet* | | | |

## Relationship Map

*No relationships defined yet.*

## Family Trees

*No family trees defined yet.*
```

**`worldbuilding/_index.md`:**
```markdown
---
type: world-registry
story: {story-title-kebab}
---

# Worldbuilding

## World Overview

*Describe the world at a high level here.*

## Locations

| Name | Type | Region | File |
|------|------|--------|------|
| *No locations yet* | | | |

## Systems

| Name | Type | File |
|------|------|------|
| *No systems yet* | | |

## Factions

| Name | Type | Status | File |
|------|------|--------|------|
| *No factions yet* | | | |

## Artifacts

| Name | Type | Status | File |
|------|------|--------|------|
| *No artifacts yet* | | | |
```

**`plot/_index.md`:**
```markdown
---
type: plot-registry
story: {story-title-kebab}
structure: three-act
---

# Plot Structure

## Story Structure

**Model:** Three-Act Structure (adjust as needed)

## Arcs

| Name | Type | Status | File |
|------|------|--------|------|
| *No arcs yet* | | | |

## Theme Tracking

| Theme | Arcs | Chapters |
|-------|------|----------|
| *No themes tracked yet* | | |
```

**`plot/timeline.md`:**
```markdown
---
type: timeline
story: {story-title-kebab}
---

# Story Timeline

| When | Event | Arc | Chapter |
|------|-------|-----|---------|
| *No events yet* | | | |
```

**`chapters/_index.md`:**
```markdown
---
type: chapter-registry
story: {story-title-kebab}
---

# Chapters

## Registry

| # | Title | POV | Status | Word Count | File |
|---|-------|-----|--------|------------|------|
| *No chapters yet* | | | | | |

## Total Word Count: 0
```

Also create the v2 support files. Every registry and `continuity/state.md` needs `story: {story-title-kebab}` in addition to its `type`, or `story validate` reports a missing `story` field:

- `scenes/_index.md` with frontmatter `type: scene-registry` and `story: {story-title-kebab}`
- `continuity/state.md` with frontmatter `type: continuity-state`, `story: {story-title-kebab}`, `current-chapter: 0`, and empty `character-state`, `object-state`, and `knowledge-state` lists
- `continuity/questions/_index.md` with frontmatter `type: question-registry` and `story: {story-title-kebab}`
- `continuity/promises/_index.md` with frontmatter `type: promise-registry` and `story: {story-title-kebab}`
- `continuity/clues/_index.md` with frontmatter `type: clue-registry` and `story: {story-title-kebab}`
- `glossary/_index.md` with frontmatter `type: glossary-registry` and `story: {story-title-kebab}`
- `style-sheet.md` (optional) with frontmatter `type: style-sheet`, `dialect: unspecified`, and empty `preferred`, `watch-words`, and `allow-words` lists, plus the body sections described in the `voice-style` skill

If manual initialization gets tedious, stop and ask the user to install or run the Story CLI rather than inventing a different project shape.

6. Present a summary of what was created and suggest next steps:
   - "Workshop the premise" (triggers premise-workshop skill) if the premise is still a guess
   - "Add your first character" (triggers character-management skill)
   - "Start worldbuilding" (triggers worldbuilding skill)
   - "Define your plot structure" (triggers plot-structure skill)
   - "Set up the style sheet" (triggers voice-style skill) once there is a writing sample
   - "Run `story next .`" to show deterministic next actions

7. When CLI access is available, run a final maintenance check:

```shell
story validate {story-title-kebab}
```

If `story` is not installed, use `bun run story --` from the Story Skills repository checkout or the bundled fallback `node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js` with the same arguments, resolving the path relative to this skill folder.

## Reference Files

- **`references/title-logline.md`** - Title craft (comps, hook phrasing, title as promise) and the logline recipe

## Conventions

These conventions apply across ALL story skills:

- **Kebab-case filenames** for all entity files (e.g., `sera-voss.md`, `ashen-citadel.md`)
- **YAML frontmatter** on every file for structured metadata
- **Schema version** - `story.md` frontmatter includes `schema-version: 2`
- **`_index.md`** files are authoritative registries for each domain
- **`story.md`** is the top-level bible read by all skills for context
- **`style-sheet.md`** records voice and house style; skills that write or revise prose read it
- **Bidirectional cross-links** - when referencing another entity, update both files
- **Character identifiers** use the kebab-case filename without extension (e.g., `sera-voss`)
- **Death tracking** - when a character dies on the page, set `status: deceased` and `died-in: chapter-{NN}` so `story continuity` can flag posthumous appearances
- **`mentions` vs `characters`** - chapter and scene frontmatter lists characters present in-scene under `characters`; characters who are only referenced, remembered, recorded, or seen in flashback go under `mentions`
- **Scene identifiers** use `chapter-{NN}-scene-{NN}` and live in `scenes/`
- **Continuity state** lives in `continuity/state.md`, with open questions, promises, and clues tracked under `continuity/questions/`, `continuity/promises/`, and `continuity/clues/`
- **Markdown-first artifacts** - create and edit story content directly in the target `.md` files. Do not create project-local build scripts, generator scripts, or bulk writer scripts (for example `build-*.js`) to emit story files.
- **CLI helpers stay external** - the only JavaScript helper agents should run is the installed or bundled Story CLI (`story`, `bun run story --`, or `story-maintenance/scripts/story.js`) for deterministic maintenance. Do not copy it into the user's story project, and remove any unavoidable scratch helper before finishing.
