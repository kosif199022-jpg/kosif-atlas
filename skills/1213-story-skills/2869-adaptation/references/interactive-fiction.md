# Interactive Fiction

The story project is linear: one sequence of chapters and scenes. An
interactive version keeps the project as its source and lives in
`adaptations/interactive/`, written for a tool such as Ink or Twine. The
CLI can build both: give an interactive edition project chapter `choices`
(see [Chapter Choices And The Twee Build](#chapter-choices-and-the-twee-build)).

## Branch Map From Scenes

1. List the scenes in reading order. Each scene record is a candidate
   node; its `characters`, `location`, and `state-changes` are the state
   the node sets.
2. Find decision points: scenes whose `outcome` is `yes-but` or `no-and`,
   sequel units with a `dilemma`, and any moment where a character makes a
   choice the reader could make instead.
3. For each decision, write the options and where each goes: an existing
   scene (the canonical path), a new scene, or a rejoin point.
4. Record every piece of state a choice sets (a flag, a relationship, an
   item) and every later node that reads it.

Mermaid renders on GitHub and in many editors. `story diagram` draws the
story's own graphs (relationships, locations, timeline, clues, arcs); the
branch map is written by hand.

## Branching Structures

Choose with the author; mixing is normal.

- **Branch and bottleneck:** paths split, then rejoin at key story
  events. Keeps writing manageable; state carries the differences.
- **Gauntlet:** a mostly linear path where wrong choices end early or
  loop back.
- **Time cave:** every choice branches for good. Explodes in size; best
  for short pieces.
- **Sorting hat:** early choices decide which of a few long, mostly
  linear routes the reader takes.
- **Open map or hub:** the reader moves between locations in any order;
  a good fit when the location records have `routes`.
- **Quality-based:** choices raise or lower stats that color later
  scenes instead of branching them.

Every choice should be meaningful (different consequence or expression),
informed (the reader can guess what it means), and acknowledged (the
story reacts, even briefly).

## Ink

Ink (by inkle) is a text-first scripting language, compiled with inklecate
or the Inky editor, and playable on the web or in game engines.

```ink
VAR trusted_venn = false

=== harbor_wall ===
Mara climbs the wall. Below, a second light burns on the water.
* [Follow the light] -> down_to_the_water
* [Fetch Venn]
    ~ trusted_venn = true
    -> archive

=== down_to_the_water ===
The steps are slick. {trusted_venn: Venn would have warned her.}
-> the_storm

=== archive ===
Venn is still awake.
-> the_storm

=== the_storm ===
The storm hits before either of them can speak.
-> END
```

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `=== knot ===` | A section (node) |
| `= stitch` | A sub-section inside a knot |
| `* [Choice]` | A choice that disappears once used; `+` keeps it available |
| `-> target` | Divert to a knot or stitch; `-> END` ends the story |
| `VAR name = value`, `~ name = value` | Declare and set a variable |
| `{flag: text}` | Show text only when the condition holds |
| `- ` | A gather point where branches rejoin |

## Twine

Twine is a visual passage editor that publishes to a single HTML file. Its
text format, Twee, can be kept in version control and compiled with
Tweego. Story formats (Harlowe, SugarCube, Chapbook) differ in macro
syntax; pick one and stay with it.

```twee
:: StoryTitle
The Last Ember

:: Harbor Wall
Mara climbs the wall. Below, a second light burns on the water.

[[Follow the light->Down To The Water]]
[[Fetch Venn->Archive]]

:: Archive
(set: $trustedVenn to true)
Venn is still awake.
[[Go->The Storm]]
```

(The macro line is Harlowe; SugarCube writes `<<set $trustedVenn to
true>>`.) Save as `adaptations/interactive/{story-id}.twee`.

## Chapter Choices And The Twee Build

`story build --format twee` writes Twee 3 from a project whose chapters are
the passages. Keep the interactive edition as its own project, copied from
the source book the way a translation is, so the novel's builds and
continuity stay linear. In it, each chapter is one node of the branch map,
and a chapter that branches lists its choices:

```yaml
choices:
  - text: Follow the light
    to: chapter-02
  - text: Fetch Venn
    to: chapter-03
```

- The first chapter is the start. Once any chapter has choices, a chapter
  without them is an ending, so a chapter on a branch that rejoins needs a
  single choice (`text: Go on`, `to` the bottleneck chapter).
- `text` becomes the link text: no `[`, `]`, `|`, `->`, `<-`, or line
  break, and no final `<`. Quote it if it looks like a number.
- Passages are named by chapter id (`chapter-02`) and hold the chapter
  prose without its heading. Write macros for state (`(set:)`, `<<set>>`)
  in the prose only once the author has picked a story format; the build
  names none, so Twine uses its default, Harlowe.
- `story links` errors on a choice to a missing chapter and warns about a
  chapter no choice path reaches; the build refuses the first and warns
  about the second. `story move` and `story remove chapter` rewrite and
  drop choice targets.
- Without `ifid:` in `story.md` the build derives the IFID from the story
  id and warns with the line to add. Add it before sharing the story, so
  a retitle keeps the same IFID.
- `story continuity` still reads the chapters in number order, as one
  path, so it cannot tell that two branches never meet. Check branch state
  by hand against the State table in the branch map.

[`examples/the-gull-rock-light`](../../../examples/the-gull-rock-light/)
is a small branch-and-bottleneck story built this way.

`story build --format ink` builds the same project as ink, with the same
checks: one knot per chapter (`chapter-03` becomes `chapter_03`), a sticky
`+ [text] -> knot` choice for each entry in `choices`, `-> END` for an
ending, and the title, author, and IFID as global tags. It escapes ink
syntax in the prose, so a `{`, `~`, or `VAR` line written in a chapter
comes out as text; add ink logic to the built file under
`adaptations/interactive/`, not to the chapters.

## Checks

- [ ] Every node reachable; every path reaches an ending or a bottleneck
- [ ] Every variable set is read somewhere, and every read is set first
- [ ] The canonical path reproduces the book's events
- [ ] New scenes agree with the bible: character states, deaths, and
      locations from the story project still apply unless a branch
      deliberately changes them
