# Picture Book

A picture book tells a story in words and pictures together, usually in 32
pages. The text is short (often under 500 words; `story init --form
picture-book` sets `target-words: 500`) and leaves room for the
illustrations to carry half the story. In traditional publishing, the
publisher chooses the illustrator; an author-only manuscript goes out as
text with sparse art notes. Self-published authors commission art and
need the full spread briefs.

## Pagination

Books are printed in signatures, so 32 pages (sometimes 24 or 40) is
standard. With self-ended books (the endpapers are part of the 32 pages), a
common plan is:

| Pages | Use |
|-------|-----|
| 1 | Half-title or title |
| 2-3 | Title spread, or copyright and dedication |
| 4-5 | Spread 1: story begins |
| 6-7 through 30-31 | Spreads 2-14 |
| 32 | Final single page: last line, image, or the ending's twist |

That gives 14 spreads of story (pages 4-31) plus page 32. Books with
separate endpapers, or with the title and copyright on one page, gain a
page or a spread. Front-matter placement varies; confirm the plan with the printer or
publisher. Keep the text in chapters, one per spread, numbered to match
(`chapter-01` is spread 1), so `story wordcount` counts the text per
spread. Art notes and briefs stay in the plan file (see Art Notes below).

## Spreads And The CLI Checks

The CLI treats each spread as a chapter, so give each one what a chapter
needs rather than ignoring the warnings:

- **One scene record per spread.** Without one, `story validate` warns
  `has no machine-readable scene records` for every spread and `story next`
  lists `[P1] Add scene records`. Create it with
  `story add scene "Spread 1" --chapter chapter-01 --scene 1 --pov {pov}`
  (add `--location` and `--character` for who and where the picture
  shows). The record carries the spread's cast and props for continuity.
- **`hook` is the page-turn beat.** Set each spread's chapter `hook` to
  what its turn does (`question`, `reversal`, `revelation`, `cliffhanger`,
  `decision`, `emotional`; `resolution` for the last spread). This clears
  `story pacing`'s `has no hook` warnings and records the beat the
  pagination plan names.
- **Sequel runs do not apply.** With a scene record per spread, `story
  pacing` warns `scene units in a row with no sequel`. Picture books run on
  page turns, not scene and sequel, so leave that warning as it is and do
  not add `sequel: true` to spreads to silence it.
- **No spread 15.** Until `story.md` is `revising` or `complete`, `story
  next` keeps suggesting `Draft chapter 15`. Once all 14 spreads are
  drafted, set `status: revising` in `story.md`; the suggestion stops and
  `story next` moves on to revision passes.

## Page-Turn Beats

The page turn is the picture book's cliffhanger. Plan what each turn
reveals:

- End the recto (right page) on a question, a setup, or a sentence that
  breaks mid-thought; reveal on the next spread.
- Rule of three: two attempts that fail, the third that works or goes
  spectacularly wrong, each on its own spread.
- Pace varies: a quiet spread before the big reveal; a wordless spread
  for the emotional peak.
- The ending lands on the last spread or page 32, often with a final
  image that twists or echoes the opening.

## Text And Illustration

- Do not describe what the picture shows. If the art shows a red coat,
  the text need not say so.
- Let the pictures contradict or extend the words for humor and irony
  (the text says "Nobody noticed"; the picture shows everyone staring).
- Every spread needs an illustratable moment: a location, an action, an
  emotion. Two spreads in a row with the same scene and pose is a
  problem.
- Read aloud: rhythm, repetition, and refrains matter because adults read
  these books to children. Rhyme only if every line scans perfectly;
  write and scan rhyming text with the `verse-craft` skill.
- The child character solves the problem; adults do not rescue them.

## Pagination Plan Template

Save as `adaptations/picture-book/pagination.md`:

```markdown
---
type: pagination-plan
story: {story-id}
pages: 32
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Pagination: {Title}

| Spread | Pages | Chapter | Text (words) | Page-turn beat | Picture |
|--------|-------|---------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | 4-5 | chapter-01 | 32 | Setup: Pip wants to fly | Pip on the fence at dawn |
| 2 | 6-7 | chapter-02 | 28 | Attempt one fails | Pip in the hedge, feathers everywhere |

## Spread Briefs
```

## Spread Brief Template

One per spread, under `## Spread Briefs`:

```markdown
### Spread 1 (pages 4-5)

- **Text:** chapter-01
- **Moment:** what the picture shows at this instant
- **Characters:** who is present, their emotion and pose
- **Setting:** place, time of day, weather; location id if any
- **Must show:** details the text depends on, or that later spreads pay off
- **Must not show:** what the next page turn reveals
- **Text placement:** where the words sit (clear space left or right,
  top or bottom)
- **Continuity:** clothing, props, and colors that must match other spreads
- **Art note:** only if the text misleads without the picture (see Art Notes)
```

## Art Notes

An art note tells an illustrator (or an editor reading a manuscript sent
without art) something the text is misleading or incomplete without. Keep
art notes in the pagination plan, never in chapter prose: text in a
chapter is counted as words and ships in the narration script, EPUB, and
print interior. Add an **Art note** line to the spread's brief:

```markdown
- **Art note:** Pip is not a bird. Pip is a pig.
```

When the manuscript goes out without art, copy each note into the
submission copy you build (for example `dist/`, which is disposable) in
the conventional form `[Art note: Pip is not a bird. Pip is a pig.]`,
after the spread's text.

Keep them short and rare. A manuscript full of art notes tells the
publisher the author wants to direct the illustrator.

## Checks

- [ ] Total words inside the form's range (1-1,000 for `picture-book`).
      Run `story wordcount . --write` and check the total yourself: while
      drafting, `story validate` checks only that `target-words` is inside
      the range, and it warns about the actual manuscript length only once
      `story.md` has `status: complete`
- [ ] Each spread has a scene record and a `hook`, and no art notes sit in
      chapter prose
- [ ] 14 spreads (or the printer's plan), each with a text and a picture
      moment
- [ ] Every page turn earns the turn
- [ ] No spread repeats the previous spread's picture
- [ ] Read aloud from start to end without stumbling
