# Worldbuilding

## Overview

Create and manage world elements for a story project. Locations, systems (magic, politics, technology, etc.), factions, and artifacts are stored as markdown files in the `worldbuilding/` directory with YAML frontmatter. All elements cross-reference characters and other story elements.

## Prerequisites

A story project must already exist (created via the story-init skill). Verify by checking for `story.md` in the project root.

## Creating a Location

1. Read `story.md` for genre, era, and tone context
2. Read `worldbuilding/_index.md` for existing locations and systems
3. Ask for the location's name and type (city, fortress, wilderness, etc.)
4. Build the location through conversation, covering:
   - Physical description and atmosphere
   - History relevant to the story
   - Culture and customs of inhabitants
   - Notable features characters will interact with
   - Current state at story's timeline
   - Routes to other locations: travel time in hours and mode (see `references/maps-and-routes.md`)
   - Pronunciation, if the name is invented or easily misread (`pronunciation: "KEL-ah-mar"`)
5. Before settling an invented name, run `story names "{Candidate}"` to catch clashes and look-alikes (see `references/naming-languages.md`)
6. Create it with `story add location "{Location Name}" --type "{type}"` when the CLI is available (add `--region`, `--population`, `--controlled-by`, and `--character` as known); it writes `worldbuilding/locations/{name-kebab}.md` and updates `worldbuilding/_index.md`. Then fill the body from `references/location-template.md`
7. Without the CLI, write the file from `references/location-template.md` to `worldbuilding/locations/{name-kebab}.md`
8. Without the CLI, update the `worldbuilding/_index.md` locations table
9. If notable characters are listed, verify those character files exist and add this location's kebab-case identifier to each character file's `locations` frontmatter list
10. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story links .`, and `story validate .`

## Maps, Routes, and Travel

Record travel between locations as `routes` on the location file, not in prose notes, so the CLI can check it:

```yaml
routes:
  - to: harbor-district
    hours: 1.5
    mode: on foot
  - to: saltmarsh-fort
    hours: 9
    mode: coach
```

- `to` is a location id; `story links .` checks it exists.
- A route is two-way unless the other location declares its own route back (for example, uphill slower than down).
- `story continuity .` errors when a character appears in two dated scenes at locations joined by a route and the story time between them is shorter than the route's `hours`.
- `story diagram locations` prints the route network as a Mermaid map-graph with edges labelled in hours; add `--out dist/locations.mmd` to save it. Use it to spot unreachable places and implausible shortcuts.

Use the travel speeds table in `references/economy-logistics.md` to set plausible hours, and `references/maps-and-routes.md` for the full workflow.

## Creating a System

1. Read `story.md` for genre and themes context
2. Read `worldbuilding/_index.md` for existing systems
3. Identify the system type and consult `references/world-element-types.md` for the relevant prompts. For calendars, naming languages, economies, and magic costs, also use `references/calendars.md`, `references/naming-languages.md`, and `references/economy-logistics.md`
4. Build the system through conversation, addressing the key questions for that type
5. Write the file using `references/system-template.md`
6. Save to `worldbuilding/systems/{name-kebab}.md`
7. Update `worldbuilding/_index.md` systems table
8. Cross-reference with characters who interact with the system (e.g., magic-users for a magic system)
9. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story links .`, and `story validate .`

## Creating A Faction

Use `story add faction "{Faction Name}" --type "{family|guild|government|military|religion|company|community|criminal|other}"` when the CLI is available. Otherwise create `worldbuilding/factions/{name-kebab}.md` with frontmatter fields `name`, `type`, `status`, `members`, `locations`, and `tags`.

Cover:
- Purpose and ideology
- Power base, resources, and territory
- Important members
- Conflicts and pressure points

Then:
1. Save to `worldbuilding/factions/{name-kebab}.md`
2. Update the Factions table in `worldbuilding/_index.md`
3. If members are listed, verify those character files exist
4. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story links .`, and `story validate .`

## Creating An Artifact

Use `story add artifact "{Artifact Name}" --type "{object|weapon|document|technology|relic|symbol|resource|other}"` when the CLI is available. Otherwise create `worldbuilding/artifacts/{name-kebab}.md` with frontmatter fields `name`, `type`, `status`, `owner`, `location`, and `tags`.

Cover:
- Description and recognition details
- Function, constraints, and costs
- History and prior owners
- Current owner/location state

Then:
1. Save to `worldbuilding/artifacts/{name-kebab}.md`
2. Update the Artifacts table in `worldbuilding/_index.md`
3. If an owner or location is listed, verify those files exist and cross-reference back
4. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story links .`, and `story validate .`

## Updating World Elements

1. Read the existing file
2. Make the requested changes. If a location or faction changes partway through the story (a city falls, a guild disbands), add a progression instead of editing the opening value (see Changes Over the Story)
3. If cross-references changed, update the linked files
4. Update `worldbuilding/_index.md` if name, type, or status changed
5. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story links .`, and `story validate .`

## Changes Over the Story

Location and faction files describe the world as the story opens. Record a later change as a progression, so drafting an early chapter does not see what happens in a late one:

```yaml
progressions:
  - from: chapter-10
    field: status
    value: occupied
  - from: chapter-10
    field: controlled-by
    value: lord-maren
```

- `from` is the first chapter where the new value holds. It may be a planned `chapter-NN` with no file yet
- `field` is a kebab-case single-value field, existing (`status`, `controlled-by`, `region`) or new (`ruler`, `population-note`). List fields (`notable-characters`, `routes`, `members`, `locations`, `tags`) cannot change this way
- `value` is one value. A faction's `type` and `status` must stay within their allowed values
- Keep entries in story order, and read the progressions up to the chapter being drafted before describing the place or faction in it
- Artifacts and systems do not take progressions; track an artifact's changes with `object-state` and scene `state-changes` (see the revision-continuity skill)

After adding or editing progressions, run `story validate .` and `story links .`.

## Cross-Referencing

- Locations reference characters via `notable-characters` in frontmatter
- Characters reference locations via `locations` in frontmatter
- Factions reference character members and locations
- Artifacts reference an owner character or faction and a current location
- Systems reference practitioners via character tags
- Location `routes` reference other locations by id
- Invented names across characters, locations, systems, factions, artifacts, and glossary terms may carry a `pronunciation`; `story build --format narration` gathers them into a pronunciation guide for audiobook narrators
- When a location is used in a chapter, the chapter's frontmatter `locations` field links back
- Keep the `worldbuilding/_index.md` world overview section current as elements are added

## CLI Maintenance

Use the Story CLI when it is available. If `story` is not installed, use `bun run story --` from the Story Skills repository checkout or the bundled fallback `node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js` with the same arguments, resolving the path relative to this skill folder. If no CLI is available, perform the registry, backlink, and word-count checks manually.
