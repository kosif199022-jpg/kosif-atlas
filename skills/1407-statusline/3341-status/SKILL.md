# Status

Run `TOOLU_HOST_OVERRIDE=codex bun ../../hooks/dist/status.js` resolved from this
skill directory and return its output verbatim. The explicit override is
required because lifecycle-only plugin variables are not exported to ordinary
skill shell calls. The report includes only fields available from local
repository and toolu state. Do not invent Claude-only account, model, effort,
or context-window values when the active host does not expose them.
